Data Structures for Density Estimation	"We study statistical/computational tradeoffs for the following density estimation problem: given $k$ distributions $v_1, \ldots, v_k$ over a discrete domain of size $n$, and sampling access to a distribution $p$, identify $v_i$ that is ""close"" to $p$. Our main result is the first data structure that, given a sublinear (in $n$) number of samples from $p$, identifies $v_i$ in time sublinear in $k$. We also give an improved version of the algorithm of Acharya et al. (2018) that reports $v_i$ in time linear in $k$. The experimental evaluation of the latter algorithm shows that it achieves a significant reduction in the number of operations needed to achieve a given accuracy compared to prior work."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/aamand23a	Anders Aamand, Alexandr Andoni, Justin Y.

Paging with Succinct Predictions	Paging is a prototypical problem in the area of online algorithms. It has also played a central role in the development of learning-augmented algorithms. Previous work on learning-augmented paging has investigated predictions on (i) when the current page will be requested again (reoccurrence predictions), (ii) the current state of the cache in an optimal algorithm (state predictions), (iii) all requests until the current page gets requested again, and (iv) the relative order in which pages are requested. We study learning-augmented paging from the new perspective of requiring the least possible amount of predicted information. More specifically, the predictions obtained alongside each page request are limited to one bit only. We develop algorithms satisfy all three desirable properties of learning-augmented algorithms – that is, they are consistent, robust and smooth – despite being limited to a one-bit prediction per request. We also present lower bounds establishing that our algorithms are essentially best possible.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/antoniadis23a	Antonios Antoniadis, Joan Boyar, Marek Elias, Lene Monrad Favrholdt, Ruben Hoeksma, Kim S.

Neural Continuous-Discrete State Space Models for Irregularly-Sampled Time Series	Learning accurate predictive models of real-world dynamic phenomena (e.g., climate, biological) remains a challenging task. One key issue is that the data generated by both natural and artificial processes often comprise time series that are irregularly sampled and/or contain missing observations. In this work, we propose the Neural Continuous-Discrete State Space Model (NCDSSM) for continuous-time modeling of time series through discrete-time observations. NCDSSM employs auxiliary variables to disentangle recognition from dynamics, thus requiring amortized inference only for the auxiliary variables. Leveraging techniques from continuous-discrete filtering theory, we demonstrate how to perform accurate Bayesian inference for the dynamic states. We propose three flexible parameterizations of the latent dynamics and an efficient training objective that marginalizes the dynamic states during inference. Empirical results on multiple benchmark datasets across various domains show improved imputation and forecasting performance of NCDSSM over existing models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ansari23a	Abdul Fatir Ansari, Alvin Heng, Andre Lim, Harold Soh
SGD with Large Step Sizes Learns Sparse Features	We showcase important features of the dynamics of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in the training of neural networks.

A Modern Look at the Relationship between Sharpness and Generalization	Sharpness of minima is a promising quantity that can correlate with generalization in deep networks and, when optimized during training, can improve generalization. However, standard sharpness is not invariant under reparametrizations of neural networks, and, to fix this, reparametrization-invariant sharpness definitions have been proposed, most prominently adaptive sharpness (Kwon et al., 2021). But does it really capture generalization in modern practical settings? We comprehensively explore this question in a detailed study of various definitions of adaptive sharpness in settings ranging from training from scratch on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 to fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet and BERT on MNLI. We focus mostly on transformers for which little is known in terms of sharpness despite their widespread usage. Overall, we observe that sharpness does not correlate well with generalization but rather with some training parameters like the learning rate that can be positively or negatively correlated with generalization depending on the setup. Interestingly, in multiple cases, we observe a consistent negative correlation of sharpness with OOD generalization implying that sharper minima can generalize better. Finally, we illustrate on a simple model that the right sharpness measure is highly data-dependent, and that we do not understand well this aspect for realistic data distributions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/andriushchenko23a	Maksym Andriushchenko, Francesco Croce, Maximilian Müller, Matthias Hein, Nicolas Flammarion
Near-Optimal $Φ$-Regret Learning in Extensive-Form Games	In this paper, we establish efficient and uncoupled learning dynamics so that, when employed by all players in multiplayer perfect-recall imperfect-information extensive-form games, the trigger regret of each player grows as $O(\log T)$ after $T$ repetitions of play. This improves exponentially over the prior best known trigger-regret bound of $O(T^{1/4})$, and settles a recent open question by Bai et al. (2022). As an immediate consequence, we guarantee convergence to the set of extensive-form correlated equilibria and coarse correlated equilibria at a near-optimal rate of $\frac{\log T}{T}$. Building on prior work, at the heart of our construction lies a more general result regarding fixed points deriving from rational functions with polynomial degree, a property that we establish for the fixed points of (coarse) trigger deviation functions. Moreover, our construction leverages a refined regret circuit for the convex hull, which—unlike prior guarantees—preserves the RVU property introduced by Syrgkanis et al. (NIPS, 2015); this observation has an independent interest in establishing near-optimal regret under learning dynamics based on a CFR-type decomposition of the regret.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/anagnostides23a	Ioannis Anagnostides, Gabriele Farina, Tuomas Sandholm
Meta Optimal Transport	We study the use of amortized optimization to predict optimal transport (OT) maps from the input measures, which we call Meta OT. This helps repeatedly solve similar OT problems between different measures by leveraging the knowledge and information present from past problems to rapidly predict and solve new problems. Otherwise, standard methods ignore the knowledge of the past solutions and suboptimally re-solve each problem from scratch. We instantiate Meta OT models in discrete and continuous settings between grayscale images, spherical data, classification labels, and color palettes and use them to improve the computational time of standard OT solvers.

A Kernelized Stein Discrepancy for Biological Sequences	"Generative models of biological sequences are a powerful tool for learning from complex sequence data, predicting the effects of mutations, and designing novel biomolecules with desired properties. To evaluate generative models it is important to accurately measure differences between high-dimensional distributions. In this paper we propose the ""KSD-B"", a novel divergence measure for distributions over biological sequences that is based on the kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD). The KSD-B can be evaluated even when the normalizing constant of the model is unknown; it allows for variable length sequences and can take into account biological notions of sequence distance. Unlike previous KSDs over discrete spaces the KSD-B (a) is theoretically guaranteed to detect convergence and non-convergence of distributions over sequence space and (b) can be efficiently estimated in practice. We demonstrate the advantages of the KSD-B on problems with synthetic and real data, and apply it to measure the fit of state-of-the-art machine learning models. Overall, the KSD-B enables rigorous evaluation of generative biological sequence models, allowing the accuracy of models, sampling procedures, and library designs to be checked reliably."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/amin23a	Alan Nawzad Amin, Eli N Weinstein, Debora Susan Marks
Distributed Contextual Linear Bandits with Minimax Optimal Communication Cost	We study distributed contextual linear bandits with stochastic contexts, where $N$ agents/learners act cooperatively to solve a linear bandit-optimization problem with $d$-dimensional features over the course of $T$ rounds. For this problem, we derive the first ever information-theoretic lower bound $\Omega(dN)$ on the communication cost of any algorithm that performs optimally in a regret minimization setup. We then propose a distributed batch elimination version of the LinUCB algorithm, DisBE-LUCB, where the agents share information among each other through a central server. We prove that the communication cost of DisBE-LUCB, matches our lower bound up to logarithmic factors. In particular, for scenarios with known context distribution, the communication cost of DisBE-LUCB is only $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(dN)$ and its regret is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{dNT})$, which is of the same order as that incurred by an optimal single-agent algorithm for $NT$ rounds. We also provide similar bounds for practical settings where the context distribution can only be estimated. Therefore, our proposed algorithm is nearly minimax optimal in terms of	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/amani23a	Sanae Amani, Tor Lattimore, András György, Lin Yang
Neural Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Discrepancies with Riesz Kernels	Wasserstein gradient flows of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) functionals with non-smooth Riesz kernels show a rich structure as singular measures can become absolutely continuous ones and conversely. In this paper we contribute to the understanding of such flows. We propose to approximate the backward scheme of Jordan, Kinderlehrer and Otto for computing such Wasserstein gradient flows as well as a forward scheme for so-called Wasserstein steepest descent flows by neural networks (NNs). Since we cannot restrict ourselves to absolutely continuous measures, we have to deal with transport plans and velocity plans instead of usual transport maps and velocity fields. Indeed, we approximate the disintegration of both plans by generative NNs which are learned with respect to appropriate loss functions. In order to evaluate the quality of both neural schemes, we benchmark them on the interaction energy. Here we provide analytic formulas for Wasserstein schemes starting at a Dirac measure and show their convergence as the time step size tends to zero. Finally, we illustrate our neural MMD flows by numerical examples.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/altekruger23a	Fabian Altekrüger, Johannes Hertrich, Gabriele Steidl
Robust and Scalable Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection	This paper proposes an online, provably robust, and scalable Bayesian approach for changepoint detection. The resulting algorithm has key advantages over previous work: it provides provable robustness by leveraging the generalised Bayesian perspective, and also addresses the scalability issues of previous attempts. Specifically, the proposed generalised Bayesian formalism leads to conjugate posteriors whose parameters are available in closed form by leveraging diffusion score matching. The resulting algorithm is exact, can be updated through simple algebra, and is more than 10 times faster than its closest competitor.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/altamirano23a	Matias Altamirano, Francois-Xavier Briol, Jeremias Knoblauch
Differentially Private Distributed Bayesian Linear Regression with MCMC	We propose a novel Bayesian inference framework for distributed differentially private linear regression. We consider a distributed setting where multiple parties hold parts of the data and share certain summary statistics of their portions in privacy-preserving noise. We develop a novel generative statistical model for privately shared statistics, which exploits a useful distributional relation between the summary statistics of linear regression. We propose Bayesian estimation of the regression coefficients, mainly using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, while we also provide a fast version that performs approximate Bayesian estimation in one iteration. The proposed methods have computational advantages over their competitors. We provide numerical results on both real and simulated data, which demonstrate that the proposed algorithms provide well-rounded estimation and prediction.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/alparslan23a	Baris Alparslan, Sinan Yıldırım, Ilker Birbil
On the Privacy-Robustness-Utility Trilemma in Distributed Learning	The ubiquity of distributed machine learning (ML) in sensitive public domain applications calls for algorithms that protect data privacy, while being robust to faults and adversarial behaviors. Although privacy and robustness have been extensively studied independently in distributed ML, their synthesis remains poorly understood. We present the first tight analysis of the error incurred by any algorithm ensuring robustness against a fraction of adversarial machines, as well as differential privacy (DP) for honest machines' data against any other curious entity. Our analysis exhibits a fundamental trade-off between privacy, robustness, and utility. To prove our lower bound, we consider the case of mean estimation, subject to distributed DP and robustness constraints, and devise reductions to centralized estimation of one-way marginals. We prove our matching upper bound by presenting a new distributed ML algorithm using a high-dimensional robust aggregation rule. The latter amortizes the dependence on the dimension in the error (caused by adversarial workers and DP), while being agnostic to the statistical properties of the data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/allouah23a	Youssef Allouah, Rachid Guerraoui, Nirupam Gupta, Rafael Pinot, John Stephan
A Simple Zero-shot Prompt Weighting Technique to Improve Prompt Ensembling in Text-Image Models	Contrastively trained text-image models have the remarkable ability to perform zero-shot classification, that is, classifying previously unseen images into categories that the model has never been explicitly trained to identify. However, these zero-shot classifiers need prompt engineering to achieve high accuracy. Prompt engineering typically requires hand-crafting a set of prompts for individual downstream tasks. In this work, we aim to automate this prompt engineering and improve zero-shot accuracy through prompt ensembling.

Nonlinear Advantage: Trained Networks Might Not Be As Complex as You Think	We perform an empirical study of the behaviour of deep networks when fully linearizing some of its feature channels through a sparsity prior on the overall number of nonlinear units in the network. In experiments on image classification and machine translation tasks, we investigate how much we can simplify the network function towards linearity before performance collapses. First, we observe a significant performance gap when reducing nonlinearity in the network function early on as opposed to late in training, in-line with recent observations on the time-evolution of the data-dependent NTK. Second, we find that after training, we are able to linearize a significant number of nonlinear units while maintaining a high performance, indicating that much of a network's expressivity remains unused but helps gradient descent in early stages of training. To characterize the depth of the resulting partially linearized network, we introduce a measure called average path length, representing the average number of active nonlinearities encountered along a path in the network graph. Under sparsity pressure, we find that the remaining nonlinear units organize into distinct structures, forming core-networks of near constant effective depth and width, which in turn depend on task difficulty.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ali-mehmeti-gopel23a	Christian H.X.

The Benefits of Mixup for Feature Learning	Mixup, a simple data augmentation method that randomly mixes two data points via linear interpolation, has been extensively applied in various deep learning applications to gain better generalization. However, its theoretical explanation remains largely unclear. In this work, we aim to seek a fundamental understanding of the benefits of Mixup. We first show that Mixup using different linear interpolation parameters for features and labels can still achieve similar performance as standard Mixup. This indicates that the intuitive linearity explanation in Zhang et al., (2018) may not fully explain the success of Mixup. Then, we perform a theoretical study of Mixup from the feature learning perspective. We consider a feature-noise data model and show that Mixup training can effectively learn the rare features (appearing in a small fraction of data) from its mixture with the common features (appearing in a large fraction of data). In contrast, standard training can only learn the common features but fails to learn the rare features, thus suffering from bad generalization performance. Moreover, our theoretical analysis also shows that the benefits of Mixup for feature learning are mostly gained in the early training phase, based on which we propose to apply early stopping in Mixup. Experimental results verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the early-stopped Mixup training.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zou23a	Difan Zou, Yuan Cao, Yuanzhi Li, Quanquan Gu
spred: Solving L1 Penalty with SGD	"We propose to minimize a generic differentiable objective with $L_1$ constraint using a simple reparametrization and straightforward stochastic gradient descent. Our proposal is the direct generalization of previous ideas that the $L_1$ penalty may be equivalent to a differentiable reparametrization with weight decay. We prove that the proposed method, spred, is an exact differentiable solver of $L_1$ and that the reparametrization trick is completely ""benign"" for a generic nonconvex function. Practically, we demonstrate the usefulness of the method in (1) training sparse neural networks to perform gene selection tasks, which involves finding relevant features in a very high dimensional space, and (2) neural network compression task, to which previous attempts at applying the $L_1$-penalty have been unsuccessful. Conceptually, our result bridges the gap between the sparsity in deep learning and conventional statistical learning."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ziyin23a	Liu Ziyin, Zihao Wang
Revisiting Bellman Errors for Offline Model Selection	Offline model selection (OMS), that is, choosing the best policy from a set of many policies given only logged data, is crucial for applying offline RL in real-world settings. One idea that has been extensively explored is to select policies based on the mean squared Bellman error (MSBE) of the associated Q-functions. However, previous work has struggled to obtain adequate OMS performance with Bellman errors, leading many researchers to abandon the idea. To this end, we elucidate why previous work has seen pessimistic results with Bellman errors and identify conditions under which OMS algorithms based on Bellman errors will perform well. Moreover, we develop a new estimator of the MSBE that is more accurate than prior methods. Our estimator obtains impressive OMS performance on diverse discrete control tasks, including Atari games.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zitovsky23a	Joshua P Zitovsky, Daniel De Marchi, Rishabh Agarwal, Michael Rene Kosorok
Are Random Decompositions all we need in High Dimensional Bayesian Optimisation?	Learning decompositions of expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions promises to scale Bayesian optimisation (BO) to high-dimensional problems. However, the success of these techniques depends on finding proper decompositions that accurately represent the black-box. While previous works learn those decompositions based on data, we investigate data-independent decomposition sampling rules in this paper. We find that data-driven learners of decompositions can be easily misled towards local decompositions that do not hold globally across the search space. Then, we formally show that a random tree-based decomposition sampler exhibits favourable theoretical guarantees that effectively trade off maximal information gain and functional mismatch between the actual black-box and its surrogate as provided by the decomposition. Those results motivate the development of the random decomposition upper-confidence bound algorithm (RDUCB) that is straightforward to implement - (almost) plug-and-play - and, surprisingly, yields significant empirical gains compared to the previous state-of-the-art on a comprehensive set of benchmarks. We also confirm the plug-and-play nature of our modelling component by integrating our method with HEBO, showing improved practical gains in the highest dimensional tasks from Bayesmark problem suite.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ziomek23a	Juliusz Krzysztof Ziomek, Haitham Bou Ammar
Likelihood Adjusted Semidefinite Programs for Clustering Heterogeneous Data	Clustering is a widely deployed unsupervised learning tool. Model-based clustering is a flexible framework to tackle data heterogeneity when the clusters have different shapes. Likelihood-based inference for mixture distributions often involves non-convex and high-dimensional objective functions, imposing difficult computational and statistical challenges. The classic expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is a computationally thrifty iterative method that maximizes a surrogate function minorizing the log-likelihood of observed data in each iteration, which however suffers from bad local maxima even in the special case of the standard Gaussian mixture model with common isotropic covariance matrices. On the other hand, recent studies reveal that the unique global solution of a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxed $K$-means achieves the information-theoretically sharp threshold for perfectly recovering the cluster labels under the standard Gaussian mixture model. In this paper, we extend the SDP approach to a general setting by integrating cluster labels as model parameters and propose an iterative likelihood adjusted SDP (iLA-SDP) method that directly maximizes the exact observed likelihood in the presence of data heterogeneity. By lifting the cluster assignment to group-specific membership matrices, iLA-SDP avoids centroids estimation – a key feature that allows exact recovery under well-separateness of centroids without being trapped by their adversarial configurations. Thus iLA-SDP is less sensitive than EM to initialization and more stable on high-dimensional data. Our numeric experiments demonstrate that iLA-SDP can achieve lower mis-clustering errors over several widely used clustering methods including $K$-means, SDP and EM algorithms.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhuang23a	Yubo Zhuang, Xiaohui Chen, Yun Yang
Label Distributionally Robust Losses for Multi-class Classification: Consistency, Robustness and Adaptivity	We study a family of loss functions named label-distributionally robust (LDR) losses for multi-class classification that are formulated from distributionally robust optimization (DRO) perspective, where the uncertainty in the given label information are modeled and captured by taking the worse case of distributional weights. The benefits of this perspective are several fold: (i) it provides a unified framework to explain the classical cross-entropy (CE) loss and SVM loss and their variants, (ii) it includes a special family corresponding to the temperature-scaled CE loss, which is widely adopted but poorly understood; (iii) it allows us to achieve adaptivity to the uncertainty degree of label information at an instance level. Our contributions include: (1) we study both consistency and robustness by establishing top-$k$ ($\forall k\geq 1$) consistency of LDR losses for multi-class classification, and a negative result that a top-$1$ consistent and symmetric robust loss cannot achieve top-$k$ consistency simultaneously for all $k\geq 2$; (2) we propose a new adaptive LDR loss that automatically adapts the individualized temperature parameter to the noise degree of class label of each instance; (3) we demonstrate stable and competitive performance for the proposed adaptive LDR loss on 7 benchmark datasets under 6 noisy label and 1 clean settings against 13 loss functions, and on one real-world noisy dataset.

Weak Proxies are Sufficient and Preferable for Fairness with Missing Sensitive Attributes	Evaluating fairness can be challenging in practice because the sensitive attributes of data are often inaccessible due to privacy constraints. The go-to approach that the industry frequently adopts is using off-the-shelf proxy models to predict the missing sensitive attributes, e.g. Meta (Alao et al., 2021) and Twitter (Belli et al., 2022). Despite its popularity, there are three important questions unanswered: (1) Is directly using proxies efficacious in measuring fairness? (2) If not, is it possible to accurately evaluate fairness using proxies only? (3) Given the ethical controversy over infer-ring user private information, is it possible to only use weak (i.e. inaccurate) proxies in order to protect privacy? Our theoretical analyses show that directly using proxy models can give a false sense of (un)fairness. Second, we develop an algorithm that is able to measure fairness (provably) accurately with only three properly identified proxies. Third, we show that our algorithm allows the use of only weak proxies (e.g. with only 68.85% accuracy on COMPAS), adding an extra layer of protection on user privacy. Experiments validate our theoretical analyses and show our algorithm can effectively measure and mitigate bias. Our results imply a set of practical guidelines for prac-titioners on how to use proxies properly.

Surrogate Model Extension (SME): A Fast and Accurate Weight Update Attack on Federated Learning	In Federated Learning (FL) and many other distributed training frameworks, collaborators can hold their private data locally and only share the network weights trained with the local data after multiple iterations. Gradient inversion is a family of privacy attacks that recovers data from its generated gradients. Seemingly, FL can provide a degree of protection against gradient inversion attacks on weight updates, since the gradient of a single step is concealed by the accumulation of gradients over multiple local iterations. In this work, we propose a principled way to extend gradient inversion attacks to weight updates in FL, thereby better exposing weaknesses in the presumed privacy protection inherent in FL. In particular, we propose a surrogate model method based on the characteristic of two-dimensional gradient flow and low-rank property of local updates. Our method largely boosts the ability of gradient inversion attacks on weight updates containing many iterations and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Additionally, our method runs up to $100\times$ faster than the SOTA baseline in the common FL scenario. Our work re-evaluates and highlights the privacy risk of sharing network weights.

Provable Multi-instance Deep AUC Maximization with Stochastic Pooling	This paper considers a novel application of deep AUC maximization (DAM) for multi-instance learning (MIL), in which a single class label is assigned to a bag of instances (e.g., multiple 2D slices of a CT scan for a patient). We address a neglected yet non-negligible computational challenge of MIL in the context of DAM, i.e., bag size is too large to be loaded into GPU memory for backpropagation, which is required by the standard pooling methods of MIL. To tackle this challenge, we propose variance-reduced stochastic pooling methods in the spirit of stochastic optimization by formulating the loss function over the pooled prediction as a multi-level compositional function. By synthesizing techniques from stochastic compositional optimization and non-convex min-max optimization, we propose a unified and provable muli-instance DAM (MIDAM) algorithm with stochastic smoothed-max pooling or stochastic attention-based pooling, which only samples a few instances for each bag to compute a stochastic gradient estimator and to update the model parameter. We establish a similar convergence rate of the proposed MIDAM algorithm as the state-of-the-art DAM algorithms. Our extensive experiments on conventional MIL datasets and medical datasets demonstrate the superiority of our MIDAM algorithm.

XTab: Cross-table Pretraining for Tabular Transformers	The success of self-supervised learning in computer vision and natural language processing has motivated pretraining methods on tabular data. However, most existing tabular self-supervised learning models fail to leverage information across multiple data tables and cannot generalize to new tables. In this work, we introduce XTab, a framework for cross-table pretraining of tabular transformers on datasets from various domains. We address the challenge of inconsistent column types and quantities among tables by utilizing independent featurizers and using federated learning to pretrain the shared component. Tested on 84 tabular prediction tasks from the OpenML-AutoML Benchmark (AMLB), we show that (1) XTab consistently boosts the generalizability, learning speed, and performance of multiple tabular transformers, (2) by pretraining FT-Transformer via XTab, we achieve superior performance than other state-of-the-art tabular deep learning models on various tasks such as regression, binary, and multiclass classification.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhu23k	Bingzhao Zhu, Xingjian Shi, Nick Erickson, Mu Li, George Karypis, Mahsa Shoaran
LeadFL: Client Self-Defense against Model Poisoning in Federated Learning	Federated Learning is highly susceptible to backdoor and targeted attacks as participants can manipulate their data and models locally without any oversight on whether they follow the correct process. There are a number of server-side defenses that mitigate the attacks by modifying or rejecting local updates submitted by clients. However, we find that bursty adversarial patterns with a high variance in the number of malicious clients can circumvent the existing defenses. We propose a client-self defense, LeadFL, that is combined with existing server-side defenses to thwart backdoor and targeted attacks. The core idea of LeadFL is a novel regularization term in local model training such that the Hessian matrix of local gradients is nullified. We provide the convergence analysis of LeadFL and its robustness guarantee in terms of certified radius. Our empirical evaluation shows that LeadFL is able to mitigate bursty adversarial patterns for both iid and non-iid data distributions. It frequently reduces the backdoor accuracy from more than 75% for state-of-the-art defenses to less than 10% while its impact on the main task accuracy is always less than for other client-side defenses.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhu23j	Chaoyi Zhu, Stefanie Roos, Lydia Y.

Interpolation for Robust Learning: Data Augmentation on Wasserstein Geodesics	We propose to study and promote the robustness of a model as per its performance on a continuous geodesic interpolation of subpopulations, e.g., a class of samples in a classification problem. Specifically, (1) we augment the data by finding the worst-case Wasserstein barycenter on the geodesic connecting subpopulation distributions. (2) we regularize the model for smoother performance on the continuous geodesic path connecting subpopulation distributions. (3) Additionally, we provide a theoretical guarantee of robustness improvement and investigate how the geodesic location and the sample size contribute, respectively. Experimental validations of the proposed strategy on four datasets including CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, establish the efficacy of our method, e.g., our method improves the baselines' certifiable robustness on CIFAR10 upto 7.7%, with 16.8% on empirical robustness on CIFAR-100. Our work provides a new perspective of model robustness through the lens of Wasserstein geodesic-based interpolation with a practical off-the-shelf strategy that can be combined with existing robust training methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhu23i	Jiacheng Zhu, Jielin Qiu, Aritra Guha, Zhuolin Yang, Xuanlong Nguyen, Bo Li, Ding Zhao
Benign Overfitting in Deep Neural Networks under Lazy Training	This paper focuses on over-parameterized deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activation functions and proves that when the data distribution is well-separated, DNNs can achieve Bayes-optimal test error for classification while obtaining (nearly) zero-training error under the lazy training regime. For this purpose, we unify three interrelated concepts of overparameterization, benign overfitting, and the Lipschitz constant of DNNs. Our results indicate that interpolating with smoother functions leads to better generalization. Furthermore, we investigate the special case where interpolating smooth ground-truth functions is performed by DNNs under the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime for generalization. Our result demonstrates that the generalization error converges to a constant order that only depends on label noise and initialization noise, which theoretically verifies benign overfitting. Our analysis provides a tight lower bound on the normalized margin under non-smooth activation functions, as well as the minimum eigenvalue of NTK under high-dimensional settings, which has its own interest in learning theory.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhu23h	Zhenyu Zhu, Fanghui Liu, Grigorios Chrysos, Francesco Locatello, Volkan Cevher
Unleashing Mask: Explore the Intrinsic Out-of-Distribution Detection Capability	Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an indispensable aspect of secure AI when deploying machine learning models in real-world applications. Previous paradigms either explore better scoring functions or utilize the knowledge of outliers to equip the models with the ability of OOD detection. However, few of them pay attention to the intrinsic OOD detection capability of the given model. In this work, we generally discover the existence of an intermediate stage of a model trained on in-distribution (ID) data having higher OOD detection performance than that of its final stage across different settings, and further identify one critical data-level attribution to be learning with the atypical samples. Based on such insights, we propose a novel method, Unleashing Mask, which aims to restore the OOD discriminative capabilities of the well-trained model with ID data. Our method utilizes a mask to figure out the memorized atypical samples, and then finetune the model or prune it with the introduced mask to forget them. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Principled Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback from Pairwise or K-wise Comparisons	We provide a theoretical framework for Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). We show that when the underlying true reward is linear, under both Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model (pairwise comparison) and Plackett-Luce (PL) model ($K$-wise comparison), MLE converges under certain semi-norm for the family of linear reward. On the other hand, when training a policy based on the learned reward model, we show that MLE fails while a pessimistic MLE provides policies with good performance under certain coverage assumption. We also show that under the PL model, both the true MLE and a different MLE which splits the $K$-wise comparison into pairwise comparisons converge, while the true MLE is asymptotically more efficient. Our results validate the empirical success of the existing RLHF algorithms, and provide new insights for algorithm design. Our analysis can also be applied for the problem of online RLHF and inverse reinforcement learning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhu23f	Banghua Zhu, Michael Jordan, Jiantao Jiao
Decentralized SGD and Average-direction SAM are Asymptotically Equivalent	Decentralized stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD) allows collaborative learning on massive devices simultaneously without the control of a central server. However, existing theories claim that decentralization invariably undermines generalization. In this paper, we challenge the conventional belief and present a completely new perspective for understanding decentralized learning. We prove that D-SGD implicitly minimizes the loss function of an average-direction Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) algorithm under general non-convex non-$\beta$-smooth settings. This surprising asymptotic equivalence reveals an intrinsic regularization-optimization trade-off and three advantages of decentralization: (1) there exists a free uncertainty evaluation mechanism in D-SGD to improve posterior estimation; (2) D-SGD exhibits a gradient smoothing effect; and (3) the sharpness regularization effect of D-SGD does not decrease as total batch size increases, which justifies the potential generalization benefit of D-SGD over centralized SGD (C-SGD) in large-batch scenarios.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhu23e	Tongtian Zhu, Fengxiang He, Kaixuan Chen, Mingli Song, Dacheng Tao
Exploring Model Dynamics for Accumulative Poisoning Discovery	Adversarial poisoning attacks pose huge threats to various machine learning applications. Especially, the recent accumulative poisoning attacks show that it is possible to achieve irreparable harm on models via a sequence of imperceptible attacks followed by a trigger batch. Due to the limited data-level discrepancy in real-time data streaming, current defensive methods are indiscriminate in handling the poison and clean samples. In this paper, we dive into the perspective of model dynamics and propose a novel information measure, namely, Memorization Discrepancy, to explore the defense via the model-level information. By implicitly transferring the changes in the data manipulation to that in the model outputs, Memorization Discrepancy can discover the imperceptible poison samples based on their distinct dynamics from the clean samples. We thoroughly explore its properties and propose Discrepancy-aware Sample Correction (DSC) to defend against accumulative poisoning attacks. Extensive experiments comprehensively characterized Memorization Discrepancy and verified its effectiveness. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/Memorization-Discrepancy.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhu23d	Jianing Zhu, Xiawei Guo, Jiangchao Yao, Chao Du, Li He, Shuo Yuan, Tongliang Liu, Liang Wang, Bo Han

Markovian Gaussian Process Variational Autoencoders	Sequential VAEs have been successfully considered for many high-dimensional time series modelling problems, with many variant models relying on discrete-time mechanisms such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). On the other hand, continuous-time methods have recently gained attraction, especially in the context of irregularly-sampled time series, where they can better handle the data than discrete-time methods. One such class are Gaussian process variational autoencoders (GPVAEs), where the VAE prior is set as a Gaussian process (GP). However, a major limitation of GPVAEs is that it inherits the cubic computational cost as GPs, making it unattractive to practioners. In this work, we leverage the equivalent discrete state space representation of Markovian GPs to enable linear time GPVAE training via Kalman filtering and smoothing. For our model, Markovian GPVAE (MGPVAE), we show on a variety of high-dimensional temporal and spatiotemporal tasks that our method performs favourably compared to existing approaches whilst being computationally highly scalable.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhu23b	Harrison Zhu, Carles Balsells-Rodas, Yingzhen Li

Sharp Variance-Dependent Bounds in Reinforcement Learning: Best of Both Worlds in Stochastic and Deterministic Environments	We study variance-dependent regret bounds for Markov decision processes (MDPs). Algorithms with variance-dependent regret guarantees can automatically exploit environments with low variance (e.g., enjoying constant regret on deterministic MDPs). The existing algorithms are either variance-independent or suboptimal. We first propose two new environment norms to characterize the fine-grained variance properties of the environment. For model-based methods, we design a variant of the MVP algorithm (Zhang et al., 2021a). We apply new analysis techniques to demonstrate that this algorithm enjoys variance-dependent bounds with respect to the norms we propose. In particular, this bound is simultaneously minimax optimal for both stochastic and deterministic MDPs, the first result of its kind. We further initiate the study on model-free algorithms with variance-dependent regret bounds by designing a reference-function-based algorithm with a novel capped-doubling reference update schedule. Lastly, we also provide lower bounds to complement our upper bounds.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhou23t	Runlong Zhou, Zhang Zihan, Simon Shaolei Du
On Strengthening and Defending Graph Reconstruction Attack with Markov Chain Approximation	Although powerful graph neural networks (GNNs) have boosted numerous real-world applications, the potential privacy risk is still underexplored. To close this gap, we perform the first comprehensive study of graph reconstruction attack that aims to reconstruct the adjacency of nodes. We show that a range of factors in GNNs can lead to the surprising leakage of private links. Especially by taking GNNs as a Markov chain and attacking GNNs via a flexible chain approximation, we systematically explore the underneath principles of graph reconstruction attack, and propose two information theory-guided mechanisms: (1) the chain-based attack method with adaptive designs for extracting more private information; (2) the chain-based defense method that sharply reduces the attack fidelity with moderate accuracy loss. Such two objectives disclose a critical belief that to recover better in attack, you must extract more multi-aspect knowledge from the trained GNN; while to learn safer for defense, you must forget more link-sensitive information in training GNNs. Empirically, we achieve state-of-the-art results on six datasets and three common GNNs. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/MC-GRA.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhou23s	Zhanke Zhou, Chenyu Zhou, Xuan Li, Jiangchao Yao, Quanming Yao, Bo Han
ESC: Exploration with Soft Commonsense Constraints for Zero-shot Object Navigation	The ability to accurately locate and navigate to a specific object is a crucial capability for embodied agents that operate in the real world and interact with objects to complete tasks. Such object navigation tasks usually require large-scale training in visual environments with labeled objects, which generalizes poorly to novel objects in unknown environments. In this work, we present a novel zero-shot object navigation method, Exploration with Soft Commonsense constraints (ESC), that transfers commonsense knowledge in pre-trained models to open-world object navigation without any navigation experience nor any other training on the visual environments. First, ESC leverages a pre-trained vision and language model for open-world prompt-based grounding and a pre-trained commonsense language model for room and object reasoning. Then ESC converts commonsense knowledge into navigation actions by modeling it as soft logic predicates for efficient exploration. Extensive experiments on MP3D, HM3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks show that our ESC method improves significantly over baselines, and achieves new state-of-the-art results for zero-shot object navigation (e.g., 288% relative Success Rate improvement than CoW on MP3D).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhou23r	Kaiwen Zhou, Kaizhi Zheng, Connor Pryor, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin, Lise Getoor, Xin Eric Wang
Learning to Decouple Complex Systems	A complex system with cluttered observations may be a coupled mixture of multiple simple sub-systems corresponding to latent entities. Such sub-systems may hold distinct dynamics in the continuous-time domain; therein, complicated interactions between sub-systems also evolve over time. This setting is fairly common in the real world but has been less considered. In this paper, we propose a sequential learning approach under this setting by decoupling a complex system for handling irregularly sampled and cluttered sequential observations. Such decoupling brings about not only subsystems describing the dynamics of each latent entity but also a meta-system capturing the interaction between entities over time. Specifically, we argue that the meta-system evolving within a simplex is governed by projected differential equations (ProjDEs). We further analyze and provide neural-friendly projection operators in the context of Bregman divergence. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show the advantages of our approach when facing complex and cluttered sequential data compared to the state-of-the-art.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhou23q	Zihan Zhou, Tianshu Yu
A Three-regime Model of Network Pruning	Recent work has highlighted the complex influence training hyperparameters, e.g., the number of training epochs, can have on the prunability of machine learning models. Perhaps surprisingly, a systematic approach to predict precisely how adjusting a specific hyperparameter will affect prunability remains elusive. To address this gap, we introduce a phenomenological model grounded in the statistical mechanics of learning. Our approach uses temperature-like and load-like parameters to model the impact of neural network (NN) training hyperparameters on pruning performance. A key empirical result we identify is a sharp transition phenomenon: depending on the value of a load-like parameter in the pruned model, increasing the value of a temperature-like parameter in the pre-pruned model may either enhance or impair subsequent pruning performance. Based on this transition, we build a three-regime model by taxonomizing the global structure of the pruned NN loss landscape. Our model reveals that the dichotomous effect of high temperature is associated with transitions between distinct types of global structures in the post-pruned model. Based on our results, we present three case-studies: 1) determining whether to increase or decrease a hyperparameter for improved pruning; 2) selecting the best model to prune from a family of models; and 3) tuning the hyperparameter of the Sharpness Aware Minimization method for better pruning performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhou23p	Yefan Zhou, Yaoqing Yang, Arin Chang, Michael W.

Towards Omni-generalizable Neural Methods for Vehicle Routing Problems	Learning heuristics for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) has gained much attention due to the less reliance on hand-crafted rules. However, existing methods are typically trained and tested on the same task with a fixed size and distribution (of nodes), and hence suffer from limited generalization performance. This paper studies a challenging yet realistic setting, which considers generalization across both size and distribution in VRPs. We propose a generic meta-learning framework, which enables effective training of an initialized model with the capability of fast adaptation to new tasks during inference. We further develop a simple yet efficient approximation method to reduce the training overhead. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and benchmark instances of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

From Relational Pooling to Subgraph GNNs: A Universal Framework for More Expressive Graph Neural Networks	Relational pooling is a framework for building more expressive and permutation-invariant graph neural networks. However, there is limited understanding of the exact enhancement in the expressivity of RP and its connection with the Weisfeiler-Lehman hierarchy. Starting from RP, we propose to explicitly assign labels to nodes as additional features to improve graph isomorphism distinguishing power of message passing neural networks. The method is then extended to higher-dimensional WL, leading to a novel $k,l$-WL algorithm, a more general framework than $k$-WL. We further introduce the subgraph concept into our hierarchy and propose a localized $k,l$-WL framework, incorporating a wide range of existing work, including many subgraph GNNs. Theoretically, we analyze the expressivity of $k,l$-WL w.r.t. $k$ and $l$ and compare it with the traditional $k$-WL. Complexity reduction methods are also systematically discussed to build powerful and practical $k,l$-GNN instances. We theoretically and experimentally prove that our method is universally compatible and capable of improving the expressivity of any base GNN model. Our $k,l$-GNNs achieve superior performance on many synthetic and real-world datasets, which verifies the effectiveness of our framework.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhou23n	Cai Zhou, Xiyuan Wang, Muhan Zhang
Phase-aware Adversarial Defense for Improving Adversarial Robustness	Deep neural networks have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial noise. Recent works show that exploring the impact of adversarial noise on intrinsic components of data can help improve adversarial robustness. However, the pattern closely related to human perception has not been deeply studied. In this paper, inspired by the cognitive science, we investigate the interference of adversarial noise from the perspective of image phase, and find ordinarily-trained models lack enough robustness against phase-level perturbations. Motivated by this, we propose a joint adversarial defense method: a	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhou23m	Dawei Zhou, Nannan Wang, Heng Yang, Xinbo Gao, Tongliang Liu
Horizon-Free and Variance-Dependent Reinforcement Learning for Latent Markov Decision Processes	We study regret minimization for reinforcement learning (RL) in Latent Markov Decision Processes (LMDPs) with context in hindsight. We design a novel model-based algorithmic framework which can be instantiated with both a model-optimistic and a value-optimistic solver. We prove an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathsf{Var}^\star M \Gamma S A K})$ regret bound where $\tilde{O}$ hides logarithm factors, $M$ is the number of contexts, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, $K$ is the number of episodes, $\Gamma \le S$ is the maximum transition degree of any state-action pair, and $\mathsf{Var}^\star$ is a variance quantity describing the determinism of the LMDP. The regret bound only scales logarithmically with the planning horizon, thus yielding the first (nearly) horizon-free regret bound for LMDP. This is also the first problem-dependent regret bound for LMDP. Key in our proof is an analysis of the total variance of alpha vectors (a generalization of value functions), which is handled with a truncation method. We complement our positive result with a novel $\Omega(\sqrt{\mathsf{Var}^\star M S A K})$ regret lower bound with $\Gamma = 2$, which shows our upper bound minimax optimal when $\Gamma$ is a constant for the class of variance-bounded LMDPs. Our lower bound relies on new constructions of hard instances and an argument inspired by the symmetrization technique from theoretical computer science, both of which are technically different from existing lower bound proof for MDPs, and thus can be of independent interest.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhou23l	Runlong Zhou, Ruosong Wang, Simon Shaolei Du

SlotGAT: Slot-based Message Passing for Heterogeneous Graphs	Heterogeneous graphs are ubiquitous to model complex data. There are urgent needs on powerful heterogeneous graph neural networks to effectively support important applications. We identify a potential semantic mixing issue in existing message passing processes, where the representations of the neighbors of a node v are forced to be transformed to the feature space of v for aggregation, though the neighbors are in different types. That is, the semantics in different node types are entangled together into node v's representation. To address the issue, we propose SlotGAT with separate message passing processes in slots, one for each node type, to maintain the representations in their own node-type feature spaces. Moreover, in a slot-based message passing layer, we design an attention mechanism for effective slot-wise message aggregation. Further, we develop a slot attention technique after the last layer of SlotGAT, to learn the importance of different slots in downstream tasks. Our analysis indicates that the slots in SlotGAT can preserve different semantics in various feature spaces. The superiority of SlotGAT is evaluated against 13 baselines on 6 datasets for node classification and link prediction. Our code is at https://github.com/scottjiao/SlotGAT_ICML23/.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhou23j	Ziang Zhou, Jieming Shi, Renchi Yang, Yuanhang Zou, Qing Li
Deep Latent State Space Models for Time-Series Generation	Methods based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are widely used to build generative models of time-series. In addition to high computational overhead due to explicitly computing hidden states recurrence, existing ODE-based models fall short in learning sequence data with sharp transitions - common in many real-world systems - due to numerical challenges during optimization. In this work, we propose LS4, a generative model for sequences with latent variables evolving according to a state space ODE to increase modeling capacity. Inspired by recent deep state space models (S4), we achieve speedups by leveraging a convolutional representation of LS4 which bypasses the explicit evaluation of hidden states. We show that LS4 significantly outperforms previous continuous-time generative models in terms of marginal distribution, classification, and prediction scores on real-world datasets in the Monash Forecasting Repository, and is capable of modeling highly stochastic data with sharp temporal transitions. LS4 sets state-of-the-art for continuous-time latent generative models, with significant improvement of mean squared error and tighter variational lower bounds on irregularly-sampled datasets, while also being x100 faster than other baselines on long sequences.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhou23i	Linqi Zhou, Michael Poli, Winnie Xu, Stefano Massaroli, Stefano Ermon
NNSplitter: An Active Defense Solution for DNN Model via Automated Weight Obfuscation	As a type of valuable intellectual property (IP), deep neural network (DNN) models have been protected by techniques like watermarking. However, such passive model protection cannot fully prevent model abuse. In this work, we propose an active model IP protection scheme, namely NNSplitter, which actively protects the model by splitting it into two parts: the obfuscated model that performs poorly due to weight obfuscation, and the model secrets consisting of the indexes and original values of the obfuscated weights, which can only be accessed by authorized users with the support of the trusted execution environment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of NNSplitter, e.g., by only modifying 275 out of over 11 million (i.e., 0.002%) weights, the accuracy of the obfuscated ResNet-18 model on CIFAR-10 can drop to 10%. Moreover, NNSplitter is stealthy and resilient against norm clipping and fine-tuning attacks, making it an appealing solution for DNN model protection.

Controlled Text Generation with Natural Language Instructions	Large language models can be prompted to pro- duce fluent output for a wide range of tasks without being specifically trained to do so. Nevertheless, it is notoriously difficult to control their generation in such a way that it satisfies user-specified constraints. In this paper, we present InstructCTG, a simple controlled text generation framework that incorporates different constraints by verbalizing them as natural language instructions. We annotate natural texts through a combination of off-the-shelf NLP tools and simple heuristics with the linguistic and extra-linguistic constraints they satisfy. Then, we verbalize the constraints into natural language instructions to form weakly supervised training data, i.e., we prepend the natural language verbalizations of the constraints in front of their corresponding natural language sentences. Next, we fine-tune a pre-trained language model on the augmented corpus. Compared to existing methods, InstructCTG is more flexible in terms of the types of constraints it allows the practitioner to use. It also does not require any modification of the decoding procedure. Finally, InstructCTG allows the model to adapt to new constraints without re-training through the use of in-context learning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhou23g	Wangchunshu Zhou, Yuchen Eleanor Jiang, Ethan Wilcox, Ryan Cotterell, Mrinmaya Sachan
Fourmer: An Efficient Global Modeling Paradigm for Image Restoration	"Global modeling-based image restoration frameworks have become popular. However, they often require a high memory footprint and do not consider task-specific degradation. Our work presents an alternative approach to global modeling that is more efficient for image restoration. The key insights which motivate our study are two-fold: 1) Fourier transform is capable of disentangling image degradation and content component to a certain extent, serving as the image degradation prior, and 2) Fourier domain innately embraces global properties, where each pixel in the Fourier space is involved with all spatial pixels. While adhering to the ""spatial interaction + channel evolution"" rule of previous studies, we customize the core designs with Fourier spatial interaction modeling and Fourier channel evolution. Our paradigm, Fourmer, achieves competitive performance on common image restoration tasks such as image de-raining, image enhancement, image dehazing, and guided image super-resolution, while requiring fewer computational resources. The code for Fourmer will be made publicly available."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhou23f	Man Zhou, Jie Huang, Chun-Le Guo, Chongyi Li
ODS: Test-Time Adaptation in the Presence of Open-World Data Shift	Test-time adaptation (TTA) adapts a source model to the distribution shift in testing data without using any source data. There have been plenty of algorithms concentrated on covariate shift in the last decade, i.e., $\mathcal{D}_t(X)$, the distribution of the test data is different from the source data. Nonetheless, in real application scenarios, it is necessary to consider the influence of label distribution shift, i.e., both $\mathcal{D}_t(X)$ and $\mathcal{D}_t(Y)$ are shifted, which has not been sufficiently explored yet. To remedy this, we study a new problem setup, namely, TTA with Open-world Data Shift (AODS). The goal of AODS is simultaneously adapting a model to covariate and label distribution shifts in the test phase. In this paper, we first analyze the relationship between classification error and distribution shifts. Motivated by this, we hence propose a new framework, namely ODS, which decouples the mixed distribution shift and then addresses covariate and label distribution shifts accordingly. We conduct experiments on multiple benchmarks with different types of shifts, and the results demonstrate the superior performance of our method against the state of the arts. Moreover, ODS is suitable for many TTA algorithms.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhou23e	Zhi Zhou, Lan-Zhe Guo, Lin-Han Jia, Dingchu Zhang, Yu-Feng Li

Brainformers: Trading Simplicity for Efficiency	Transformers are central to recent successes in natural language processing and computer vision. Transformers have a mostly uniform backbone where layers alternate between feed-forward and self-attention in order to build a deep network. Here we investigate this design choice and find that more complex blocks that have different permutations of layer primitives can be more efficient. Using this insight, we develop a complex block, named Brainformer, that consists of a diverse sets of layers such as sparsely gated feed-forward layers, dense feed-forward layers, attention layers, and various forms of layer normalization and activation functions. Brainformer consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art dense and sparse Transformers, in terms of both quality and efficiency. A Brainformer model with 8 billion activated parameters per token demonstrates 2x faster training convergence and 5x faster step time compared to its GLaM counterpart. In downstream task evaluation, Brainformer also demonstrates a 3% higher SuperGLUE score with fine-tuning compared to GLaM with a similar number of activated parameters. Finally, Brainformer largely outperforms a Primer dense model derived with NAS with similar computation per token on fewshot evaluations.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhou23c	Yanqi Zhou, Nan Du, Yanping Huang, Daiyi Peng, Chang Lan, Da Huang, Siamak Shakeri, David So, Andrew M.

Eliminating Adversarial Noise via Information Discard and Robust Representation Restoration	Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial noise. Denoising model-based defense is a major protection strategy. However, denoising models may fail and induce negative effects in fully white-box scenarios. In this work, we start from the latent inherent properties of adversarial samples to break the limitations. Unlike solely learning a mapping from adversarial samples to natural samples, we aim to achieve denoising by destroying the spatial characteristics of adversarial noise and preserving the robust features of natural information. Motivated by this, we propose a defense based on information discard and robust representation restoration. Our method utilize complementary masks to disrupt adversarial noise and guided denoising models to restore robust-predictive representations from masked samples. Experimental results show that our method has competitive performance against white-box attacks and effectively reverses the negative effect of denoising models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhou23b	Dawei Zhou, Yukun Chen, Nannan Wang, Decheng Liu, Xinbo Gao, Tongliang Liu
Multi-agent Online Scheduling: MMS Allocations for Indivisible Items	We consider the problem of fairly allocating a sequence of indivisible items that arrive online in an arbitrary order to a group of $n$ agents with additive normalized valuation functions, we consider the allocation of goods and chores separately and propose algorithms for approximating maximin share (MMS) allocations for both settings. When agents have identical valuation functions the problem coincides with the semi-online machine covering problem (when items are goods) and load balancing problem (when items are chores), for both of which optimal competitive ratios have been achieved. In this paper we consider the case when agents have general additive valuation functions. For the allocation of goods we show that no competitive algorithm exists even when there are only three agents and propose an optimal $0.5$-competitive algorithm for the case of two agents. For the allocation of chores we propose a $(2-1/n)$-competitive algorithm for $n\geq 3$ agents and a $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.414$-competitive algorithm for two agents. Additionally, we show that no algorithm can do better than $15/11\approx 1.364$-competitive for two agents.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhou23a	Shengwei Zhou, Rufan Bai, Xiaowei Wu
Finding the Missing-half: Graph Complementary Learning for Homophily-prone and Heterophily-prone Graphs	"Real-world graphs generally have only one kind of tendency in their connections. These connections are either homophilic-prone or heterophily-prone. While graphs with homophily-prone edges tend to connect nodes with the same class (i.e., intra-class nodes), heterophily-prone edges tend to build relationships between nodes with different classes (i.e., inter-class nodes). Existing GNNs only take the original graph as input during training. The problem with this approach is that it forgets to take into consideration the ""missing-half"" structural information, that is, heterophily-prone topology for homophily-prone graphs and homophily-prone topology for heterophily-prone graphs. In our paper, we introduce Graph cOmplementAry Learning, namely GOAL, which consists of two components: graph complementation and complemented graph convolution. The first component finds the missing-half structural information for a given graph to complement it. The complemented graph has two sets of graphs including both homophily- and heterophily-prone topology. In the latter component, to handle complemented graphs, we design a new graph convolution from the perspective of optimisation. The experiment results show that GOAL consistently outperforms all baselines in eight real-world datasets."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zheng23h	Yizhen Zheng, He Zhang, Vincent Lee, Yu Zheng, Xiao Wang, Shirui Pan
Evidential Interactive Learning for Medical Image Captioning	Medical image captioning alleviates the burden of physicians and possibly reduces medical errors by automatically generating text descriptions to describe image contents and convey findings. It is more challenging than conventional image captioning due to the complexity of medical images and the difficulty of aligning image regions with medical terms. In this paper, we propose an evidential interactive learning framework that leverages evidence-based uncertainty estimation and interactive machine learning to improve image captioning with limited labeled data. The interactive learning process involves three stages: keyword prediction, caption generation, and model retraining. First, the model predicts a list of keywords with evidence-based uncertainty and selects the most informative keywords to seek user feedback. Second, user-approved keywords are used as model input to guide the model to generate satisfactory captions. Third, the model is updated based on user-approved keywords and captions, where evidence-based uncertainty is used to allocate different weights to different data instances. Experiments on two medical image datasets illustrate that the proposed framework can effectively learn from human feedback and improve the model's performance in the future.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zheng23g	Ervine Zheng, Qi Yu
Revisiting Discriminative vs. Generative Classifiers: Theory and Implications	"A large-scale deep model pre-trained on massive labeled or unlabeled data transfers well to downstream tasks. Linear evaluation freezes parameters in the pre-trained model and trains a linear classifier separately, which is efficient and attractive for transfer. However, little work has investigated the classifier in linear evaluation except for the default logistic regression. Inspired by the statistical efficiency of naive Bayes, the paper revisits the classical topic on discriminative vs. generative classifiers. Theoretically, the paper considers the surrogate loss instead of the zero-one loss in analyses and generalizes the classical results from binary cases to multiclass ones. We show that, under mild assumptions, multiclass naive Bayes requires $O(\log n)$ samples to approach its asymptotic error while the corresponding multiclass logistic regression requires $O(n)$ samples, where $n$ is the feature dimension. To establish it, we present a multiclass $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bound framework and an explicit bound for logistic loss, which are of independent interests. Simulation results on a mixture of Gaussian validate our theoretical findings. Experiments on various pre-trained deep vision models show that naive Bayes consistently converges faster as the number of data increases. Besides, naive Bayes shows promise in few-shot cases and we observe the ""two regimes"" phenomenon in pre-trained supervised models.

Outline, Then Details: Syntactically Guided Coarse-To-Fine Code Generation	"For a complicated algorithm, its implementation by a human programmer usually starts with outlining a rough control flow followed by iterative enrichments, eventually yielding carefully generated syntactic structures and variables in a hierarchy. However, state-of-the-art large language models generate codes in a single pass, without intermediate warm-ups to reflect the structured thought process of ""outline-then-detail"". Inspired by the recent success of chain-of-thought prompting, we propose ChainCoder, a program synthesis language model that generates Python code progressively, i.e. from coarse to fine in multiple passes. We first decompose source code into layout frame components and accessory components via abstract syntax tree parsing to construct a hierarchical representation. We then reform our prediction target into a multi-pass objective, each pass generates a subsequence, which is concatenated in the hierarchy. Finally, a tailored transformer architecture is leveraged to jointly encode the natural language descriptions and syntactically aligned I/O data samples. Extensive evaluations show that ChainCoder outperforms state-of-the-arts, demonstrating that our progressive generation eases the reasoning procedure and guides the language model to generate higher-quality solutions.

Fast Sampling of Diffusion Models via Operator Learning	Diffusion models have found widespread adoption in various areas. However, their sampling process is slow because it requires hundreds to thousands of network evaluations to emulate a continuous process defined by differential equations. In this work, we use neural operators, an efficient method to solve the probability flow differential equations, to accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models. Compared to other fast sampling methods that have a sequential nature, we are the first to propose a parallel decoding method that generates images with only one model forward pass.

Improved Techniques for Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Diffusion ODEs	Diffusion models have exhibited excellent performance in various domains. The probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) of diffusion models (i.e., diffusion ODEs) is a particular case of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs), which enables deterministic inference and exact likelihood evaluation. However, the likelihood estimation results by diffusion ODEs are still far from those of the state-of-the-art likelihood-based generative models. In this work, we propose several improved techniques for maximum likelihood estimation for diffusion ODEs, including both training and evaluation perspectives. For training, we propose velocity parameterization and explore variance reduction techniques for faster convergence. We also derive an error-bounded high-order flow matching objective for finetuning, which improves the ODE likelihood and smooths its trajectory. For evaluation, we propose a novel training-free truncated-normal dequantization to fill the training-evaluation gap commonly existing in diffusion ODEs. Building upon these techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art likelihood estimation results on image datasets (2.56 on CIFAR-10, 3.43/3.69 on ImageNet-32) without variational dequantization or data augmentation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zheng23c	Kaiwen Zheng, Cheng Lu, Jianfei Chen, Jun Zhu
Semi-Supervised Offline Reinforcement Learning with Action-Free Trajectories	Natural agents can effectively learn from multiple data sources that differ in size, quality, and types of measurements. We study this heterogeneity in the context of offline reinforcement learning (RL) by introducing a new, practically motivated semi-supervised setting. Here, an agent has access to two sets of trajectories: labelled trajectories containing state, action and reward triplets at every timestep, along with unlabelled trajectories that contain only state and reward information. For this setting, we develop and study a simple meta-algorithmic pipeline that learns an inverse dynamics model on the labelled data to obtain proxy-labels for the unlabelled data, followed by the use of any offline RL algorithm on the true and proxy-labelled trajectories. Empirically, we find this simple pipeline to be highly successful — on several D4RL benchmarks (Fu et al., 2020), certain offline RL algorithms can match the performance of variants trained on a fully labelled dataset even when we label only 10% of trajectories which are highly suboptimal. To strengthen our understanding, we perform a large-scale controlled empirical study investigating the interplay of data-centric properties of the labelled and unlabelled datasets, with algorithmic design choices (e.g., choice of inverse dynamics, offline RL algorithm) to identify general trends and best practices for training RL agents on semi-supervised offline datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zheng23b	Qinqing Zheng, Mikael Henaff, Brandon Amos, Aditya Grover
Structure-informed Language Models Are Protein Designers	This paper demonstrates that language models are strong structure-based protein designers. We present LM-Design, a generic approach to reprogramming sequence-based protein language models (pLMs), that have learned massive sequential evolutionary knowledge from the universe of natural protein sequences, to acquire an immediate capability to design preferable protein sequences for given folds. We conduct a structural surgery on pLMs, where a lightweight structural adapter is implanted into pLMs and endows it with structural awareness. During inference, iterative refinement is performed to effectively optimize the generated protein sequences. Experiments show that LM-Design improves the state-of-the-art results by a large margin, leading to 4% to 12% accuracy gains in sequence recovery (e.g., 55.65%/56.63% on CATH 4.2/4.3 single-chain benchmarks, and $>$60% when designing protein complexes). We provide extensive and in-depth analyses, which verify that LM-Design can (1) indeed leverage both structural and sequential knowledge to accurately handle structurally non-deterministic regions, (2) benefit from scaling data and model size, and (3) generalize to other proteins (e.g., antibodies and de novo proteins).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zheng23a	Zaixiang Zheng, Yifan Deng, Dongyu Xue, Yi Zhou, Fei Ye, Quanquan Gu
Online Learning in Stackelberg Games with an Omniscient Follower	We study the problem of online learning in a two-player decentralized cooperative Stackelberg game. In each round, the leader first takes an action, followed by the follower who takes their action after observing the leader's move. The goal of the leader is to learn to minimize the cumulative regret based on the history of interactions. Differing from the traditional formulation of repeated Stackelberg games, we assume the follower is omniscient, with full knowledge of the true reward, and that they always best-respond to the leader's actions. We analyze the sample complexity of regret minimization in this repeated Stackelberg game. We show that depending on the reward structure, the existence of the omniscient follower may change the sample complexity drastically, from constant to exponential, even for linear cooperative Stackelberg games. This poses unique challenges for the learning process of the leader and the subsequent regret analysis.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhao23o	Geng Zhao, Banghua Zhu, Jiantao Jiao, Michael Jordan
Does Continual Learning Equally Forget All Parameters?	"Distribution shift (e.g., task or domain shift) in continual learning (CL) usually results in catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge. Although it can be alleviated by repeatedly replaying buffered data, the every-step replay is time-consuming. In this paper, we study which modules in neural networks are more prone to forgetting by investigating their training dynamics during CL. Our proposed metrics show that only a few modules are more task-specific and sensitive to task change, while others can be shared across tasks as common knowledge. Hence, we attribute forgetting mainly to the former and find that finetuning them only on a small buffer at the end of any CL method can bring non-trivial improvement. Due to the small number of finetuned parameters, such ""Forgetting Prioritized Finetuning (FPF)"" is efficient in computation. We further propose a more efficient and simpler method that entirely removes the every-step replay and replaces them by only $k$-times of FPF periodically triggered during CL. Surprisingly, this ""$k$-FPF"" performs comparably to FPF and outperforms the SOTA CL methods but significantly reduces their computational overhead and cost. In experiments on several benchmarks of class- and domain-incremental CL, FPF consistently improves existing CL methods by a large margin, and $k$-FPF further excels in efficiency without degrading the accuracy. We also empirically studied the impact of buffer size, epochs per task, and finetuning modules on the cost and accuracy of our methods."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhao23n	Haiyan Zhao, Tianyi Zhou, Guodong Long, Jing Jiang, Chengqi Zhang

RLEG: Vision-Language Representation Learning with Diffusion-based Embedding Generation	Vision-language representation learning models (e.g., CLIP) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks, which usually need large-scale training data to learn discriminative representation. Recent progress on generative diffusion models (e.g., DALL-E 2) has demonstrated that diverse high-quality samples can be synthesized by randomly sampling from generative distribution. By virtue of generative capability in this paper, we propose a novel vision-language Representation Learning method with diffusion-based Embedding Generation (RLEG), which exploits diffusion models to generate feature embedding online for learning effective vision-language representation. Specifically, we first adopt image and text encoders to extract the corresponding embeddings. Secondly, pretrained diffusion-based embedding generators are harnessed to transfer the embedding modality online between vision and language domains. The embeddings generated from the generators are then served as augmented embedding-level samples, which are applied to contrastive learning with the variant of the CLIP framework. Experimental results show that the proposed method could learn effective representation and achieve state-of-the-art performance on various tasks including image classification, image-text retrieval, object detection, semantic segmentation, and text-conditional image generation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhao23l	Liming Zhao, Kecheng Zheng, Yun Zheng, Deli Zhao, Jingren Zhou
Simplified Temporal Consistency Reinforcement Learning	Reinforcement learning (RL) is able to solve complex sequential decision-making tasks but is currently limited by sample efficiency and required computation. To improve sample efficiency, recent work focuses on model-based RL which interleaves model learning with planning. Recent methods further utilize policy learning, value estimation, and, self-supervised learning as auxiliary objectives. In this paper we show that, surprisingly, a simple representation learning approach relying only on a latent dynamics model trained by latent temporal consistency is sufficient for high-performance RL. This applies when using pure planning with a dynamics model conditioned on the representation, but, also when utilizing the representation as policy and value function features in model-free RL. In experiments, our approach learns an accurate dynamics model to solve challenging high-dimensional locomotion tasks with online planners while being 4.1$\times$ faster to train compared to ensemble-based methods. With model-free RL without planning, especially on high-dimensional tasks, such as the Deepmind Control Suite Humanoid and Dog tasks, our approach outperforms model-free methods by a large margin and matches model-based methods' sample efficiency while training 2.4$\times$ faster.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhao23k	Yi Zhao, Wenshuai Zhao, Rinu Boney, Juho Kannala, Joni Pajarinen
Local Optimization Achieves Global Optimality in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning	Policy optimization methods with function approximation are widely used in multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, it remains elusive how to design such algorithms with statistical guarantees. Leveraging a multi-agent performance difference lemma that characterizes the landscape of multi-agent policy optimization, we find that the localized action value function serves as an ideal descent direction for each local policy. Motivated by the observation, we present a multi-agent PPO algorithm in which the local policy of each agent is updated similarly to vanilla PPO. We prove that with standard regularity conditions on the Markov game and problem-dependent quantities, our algorithm converges to the globally optimal policy at a sublinear rate. We extend our algorithm to the off-policy setting and introduce pessimism to policy evaluation, which aligns with experiments. To our knowledge, this is the first provably convergent multi-agent PPO algorithm in cooperative Markov games.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhao23j	Yulai Zhao, Zhuoran Yang, Zhaoran Wang, Jason D.

Protecting Language Generation Models via Invisible Watermarking	"Language generation models have been an increasingly powerful enabler to many applications. Many such models offer free or affordable API access which makes them potentially vulnerable to model extraction attacks through distillation. To protect intellectual property (IP) and make fair use of these models, various techniques such as lexical watermarking and synonym replacement have been proposed. However, these methods can be nullified by obvious countermeasures such as ""synonym randomization"". To address this issue, we propose GINSW, a novel method to protect text generation models from being stolen through distillation. The key idea of our method is to inject secret signals into the probability vector of the decoding steps for each target token. We can then detect the secret message by probing a suspect model to tell if it is distilled from the protected one. Experimental results show that GINSW can effectively identify instances of IP infringement with minimal impact on the generation quality of protected APIs. Our method demonstrates an absolute improvement of 19 to 29 points on mean average precision (mAP) in detecting suspects compared to previous methods against watermark removal attacks."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhao23i	Xuandong Zhao, Yu-Xiang Wang, Lei Li
Transformed Distribution Matching for Missing Value Imputation	We study the problem of imputing missing values in a dataset, which has important applications in many domains. The key to missing value imputation is to capture the data distribution with incomplete samples and impute the missing values accordingly. In this paper, by leveraging the fact that any two batches of data with missing values come from the same data distribution, we propose to impute the missing values of two batches of samples by transforming them into a latent space through deep invertible functions and matching them distributionally. To learn the transformations and impute the missing values simultaneously, a simple and well-motivated algorithm is proposed. Our algorithm has fewer hyperparameters to fine-tune and generates high-quality imputations regardless of how missing values are generated. Extensive experiments over a large number of datasets and competing benchmark algorithms show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhao23h	He Zhao, Ke Sun, Amir Dezfouli, Edwin V.

Revisiting Simple Regret: Fast Rates for Returning a Good Arm	Simple regret is a natural and parameter-free performance criterion for pure exploration in multi-armed bandits yet is less popular than the probability of missing the best arm or an $\epsilon$-good arm, perhaps due to lack of easy ways to characterize it. In this paper, we make a significant progress on minimizing simple regret in both data-rich ($T\ge n$) and data-poor regime ($T \le n$) where $n$ is the number of arms and $T$ is the number of samples. At its heart is our improved instance-dependent analysis of the well-known Sequential Halving (SH) algorithm where we bound the probability of returning an arm whose mean reward is not within $\epsilon$ from the best (i.e., not $\epsilon$-good) for	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhao23g	Yao Zhao, Connor Stephens, Csaba Szepesvari, Kwang-Sung Jun
X-Paste: Revisiting Scalable Copy-Paste for Instance Segmentation using CLIP and StableDiffusion	"Copy-Paste is a simple and effective data augmentation strategy for instance segmentation. By randomly pasting object instances onto new background images, it creates new training data for free and significantly boosts the segmentation performance, especially for rare object categories. Although diverse, high-quality object instances used in Copy-Paste result in more performance gain, previous works utilize object instances either from human-annotated instance segmentation datasets or rendered from 3D object models, and both approaches are too expensive to scale up to obtain good diversity. In this paper, we revisit Copy-Paste at scale with the power of newly emerged zero-shot recognition models (e.g., CLIP) and text2image models (e.g., StableDiffusion). We demonstrate for the first time that using a text2image model to generate images or zero-shot recognition model to filter noisily crawled images for different object categories is a feasible way to make Copy-Paste truly scalable. To make such success happen, we design a data acquisition and processing framework, dubbed ""X-Paste"", upon which a systematic study is conducted. On the LVIS dataset, X-Paste provides impressive improvements over the strong baseline CenterNet2 with Swin-L as the backbone. Specifically, it archives +2.6 box AP and +2.1 mask AP gains on all classes and even more significant gains with +6.8 box AP +6.5 mask AP on long-tail classes."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhao23f	Hanqing Zhao, Dianmo Sheng, Jianmin Bao, Dongdong Chen, Dong Chen, Fang Wen, Lu Yuan, Ce Liu, Wenbo Zhou, Qi Chu, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu
Addressing Budget Allocation and Revenue Allocation in Data Market Environments Using an Adaptive Sampling Algorithm	High-quality machine learning models are dependent on access to high-quality training data. When the data are not already available, it is tedious and costly to obtain them. Data markets help with identifying valuable training data: model consumers pay to train a model, the market uses that budget to identify data and train the model (the budget allocation problem), and finally the market compensates data providers according to their data contribution (revenue allocation problem). For example, a bank could pay the data market to access data from other financial institutions to train a fraud detection model. Compensating data contributors requires understanding data's contribution to the model; recent efforts to solve this revenue allocation problem based on the Shapley value are inefficient to lead to practical data markets. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm to solve budget allocation and revenue allocation problems simultaneously in linear time. The new algorithm employs an adaptive sampling process that selects data from those providers who are contributing the most to the model. Better data means that the algorithm accesses those providers more often, and more frequent accesses corresponds to higher compensation. Furthermore, the algorithm can be deployed in both centralized and federated scenarios, boosting its applicability. We provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm that show the budget is used efficiently and the properties of revenue allocation are similar to Shapley's. Finally, we conduct an empirical evaluation to show the performance of the algorithm in practical scenarios and when compared to other baselines. Overall, we believe that the new algorithm paves the way for the implementation of practical data markets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhao23e	Boxin Zhao, Boxiang Lyu, Raul Castro Fernandez, Mladen Kolar
On Pitfalls of Test-Time Adaptation	Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has recently gained significant attention as a new paradigm for tackling distribution shifts. Despite the sheer number of existing methods, the inconsistent experimental conditions and lack of standardization in prior literature make it difficult to measure their actual efficacies and progress. To address this issue, we present a large-scale open-sourced Test-Time Adaptation Benchmark, dubbed TTAB, which includes nine state-of-the-art algorithms, a diverse array of distribution shifts, and two comprehensive evaluation protocols. Through extensive experiments, we identify three common pitfalls in prior efforts: (i) choosing appropriate hyper-parameter, especially for model selection, is exceedingly difficult due to online batch dependency; (ii) the effectiveness of TTA varies greatly depending on the quality of the model being adapted; (iii) even under optimal algorithmic conditions, existing methods still systematically struggle with certain types of distribution shifts. Our findings suggest that future research in the field should be more transparent about their experimental conditions, ensure rigorous evaluations on a broader set of models and shifts, and re-examine the assumptions underlying the potential success of TTA for practical applications.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhao23d	Hao Zhao, Yuejiang Liu, Alexandre Alahi, Tao Lin
Revisiting Structured Variational Autoencoders	Structured variational autoencoders (SVAEs) combine probabilistic graphical model priors on latent variables, deep neural networks to link latent variables to observed data, and structure-exploiting algorithms for approximate posterior inference. These models are particularly appealing for sequential data, where the prior can capture temporal dependencies. However, despite their conceptual elegance, SVAEs have proven difficult to implement, and more general approaches have been favored in practice. Here, we revisit SVAEs using modern machine learning tools and demonstrate their advantages over more general alternatives in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. First, we develop a modern implementation for hardware acceleration, parallelization, and automatic differentiation of the message passing algorithms at the core of the SVAE. Second, we show that by exploiting structure in the prior, the SVAE learns more accurate models and posterior distributions, which translate into improved performance on prediction tasks. Third, we show how the SVAE can naturally handle missing data, and we leverage this ability to develop a novel, self-supervised training approach. Altogether, these results show that the time is ripe to revisit structured variational autoencoders.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhao23c	Yixiu Zhao, Scott Linderman
Rockmate: an Efficient, Fast, Automatic and Generic Tool for Re-materialization in PyTorch	We propose Rockmate to control the memory requirements when training PyTorch DNN models. Rockmate is an automatic tool that starts from the model code and generates an equivalent model, using a predefined amount of memory for activations, at the cost of a few re-computations. Rockmate automatically detects the structure of computational and data dependencies and rewrites the initial model as a sequence of complex blocks. We show that such a structure is widespread and can be found in many models in the literature (Transformer based models, ResNet, RegNets,...). This structure allows us to solve the problem in a fast and efficient way, using an adaptation of Checkmate (too slow on the whole model but general) at the level of individual blocks and an adaptation of Rotor (fast but limited to sequential models) at the level of the sequence itself. We show through experiments on many models that Rockmate is as fast as Rotor and as efficient as Checkmate, and that it allows in many cases to obtain a significantly lower memory consumption for activations (by a factor of 2 to 5) for a rather negligible overhead (of the order of 10% to 20%). Rockmate is open source and available at https://github.com/topal-team/rockmate.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhao23b	Xunyi Zhao, Théotime Le Hellard, Lionel Eyraud-Dubois, Julia Gusak, Olivier Beaumont
Men Also Do Laundry: Multi-Attribute Bias Amplification	The phenomenon of $\textit{bias amplification}$ occurs when models amplify training set biases at test time. Existing metrics measure bias amplification with respect to single annotated attributes (e.g., $\texttt{computer}$). However, large-scale datasets typically consist of instances with multiple attribute annotations (e.g., $\{\texttt{computer}, \texttt{keyboard}\}$). We demonstrate models can learn to exploit correlations with respect to multiple attributes, which are not accounted for by current metrics. Moreover, we show that current metrics can give the erroneous impression that little to no bias amplification has occurred as they aggregate positive and negative bias scores. Further, these metrics lack an ideal value, making them difficult to interpret. To address these shortcomings, we propose a new metric: $\textit{Multi-Attribute Bias Amplification}$. We validate our metric's utility through a bias amplification analysis on the COCO, imSitu, and CelebA datasets. Finally, we benchmark bias mitigation methods using our proposed metric, suggesting possible avenues for future bias mitigation efforts.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhao23a	Dora Zhao, Jerone Andrews, Alice Xiang
Patch-level Contrastive Learning via Positional Query for Visual Pre-training	Dense contrastive learning (DCL) has been recently explored for learning localized information for dense prediction tasks (e.g., detection and segmentation). It still suffers the difficulty of mining pixels/patches correspondence between two views. A simple way is inputting the same view twice and aligning the pixel/patch representation. However, it would reduce the variance of inputs, and hurts the performance. We propose a plug-in method PQCL (Positional Query for patch-level Contrastive Learning), which allows performing patch-level contrasts between two views with exact patch correspondence. Besides, by using positional queries, PQCL increases the variance of inputs, to enhance training. We apply PQCL to popular transformer-based CL frameworks (DINO and iBOT, and evaluate them on classification, detection and segmentation tasks, where our method obtains stable improvements, especially for dense tasks. It achieves new state-of-the-art in most settings.

Robust Situational Reinforcement Learning in Face of Context Disturbances	In many real-world tasks, some parts of state features, called contexts, are independent of action signals, e.g., customer demand in inventory control, speed of lead car in autonomous driving, etc. One of the challenges of reinforcement learning in these applications is that the true context transitions can be easily exposed some unknown source of contamination, leading to a shift of context transitions between source domains and target domains, which could cause performance degradation for RL algorithms. However, existing methods on robust RL aim at learning robust policies against the deviations of the entire system dynamics. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes the framework of robust situational Markov decision process (RS-MDP) which captures the possible deviations of context transitions explicitly. To scale to large context space, we introduce the softmin smoothed robust Bellman operator to learn the robust Q-value approximately, and apply our RS-MDP framework to existing RL algorithm SAC to learn the desired robust policies. We conduct experiments on several robot control tasks with dynamic contexts and inventory control tasks to demonstrate that our algorithm can generalize better and more robust against deviations of context transitions, and outperform existing robust RL algorithms.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23bc	Jinpeng Zhang, Yufeng Zheng, Chuheng Zhang, Li Zhao, Lei Song, Yuan Zhou, Jiang Bian
Towards a Persistence Diagram that is Robust to Noise and Varied Densities	Recent works have identified that existing methods, which construct persistence diagrams in Topological Data Analysis (TDA), are not robust to noise and varied densities in a point cloud. We analyze the necessary properties of an approach that can address these two issues, and propose a new filter function for TDA based on a new data-dependent kernel which possesses these properties. Our empirical evaluation reveals that the proposed filter function provides a better means for t-SNE visualization and SVM classification than three existing methods of TDA.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23bb	Hang Zhang, Kaifeng Zhang, Kai Ming Ting, Ye Zhu

Optimal Horizon-Free Reward-Free Exploration for Linear Mixture MDPs	"We study reward-free reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation, where the agent works in two phases: (1) in the exploration phase, the agent interacts with the environment but cannot access the reward; and (2) in the planning phase, the agent is given a reward function and is expected to find a near-optimal policy based on samples collected in the exploration phase. The sample complexities of existing reward-free algorithms have a polynomial dependence on the planning horizon, which makes them intractable for long planning horizon RL problems. In this paper, we propose a new reward-free algorithm for learning linear mixture Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the transition probability can be parameterized as a linear combination of known feature mappings. At the core of our algorithm is uncertainty-weighted value-targeted regression with exploration-driven pseudo-reward and a high-order moment estimator for the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. When the total reward is bounded by $1$, we show that our algorithm only needs to explore $\tilde O\left( d^2\varepsilon^{-2}\right)$ episodes to find an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy, where $d$ is the dimension of the feature mapping. The sample complexity of our algorithm only has a polylogarithmic dependence on the planning horizon and therefore is ""horizon-free"". In addition, we provide an $\Omega\left(d^2\varepsilon^{-2}\right)$ sample complexity lower bound, which matches the sample complexity of our algorithm up to logarithmic factors, suggesting that our algorithm is optimal."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23az	Junkai Zhang, Weitong Zhang, Quanquan Gu
OpenFE: Automated Feature Generation with Expert-level Performance	The goal of automated feature generation is to liberate machine learning experts from the laborious task of manual feature generation, which is crucial for improving the learning performance of tabular data. The major challenge in automated feature generation is to efficiently and accurately identify effective features from a vast pool of candidate features. In this paper, we present OpenFE, an automated feature generation tool that provides competitive results against machine learning experts. OpenFE achieves high efficiency and accuracy with two components: 1) a novel feature boosting method for accurately evaluating the incremental performance of candidate features and 2) a two-stage pruning algorithm that performs feature pruning in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets show that OpenFE outperforms existing baseline methods by a large margin. We further evaluate OpenFE in two Kaggle competitions with thousands of data science teams participating. In the two competitions, features generated by OpenFE with a simple baseline model can beat 99.3% and 99.6% data science teams respectively. In addition to the empirical results, we provide a theoretical perspective to show that feature generation can be beneficial in a simple yet representative setting.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23ay	Tianping Zhang, Zheyu Aqa Zhang, Zhiyuan Fan, Haoyan Luo, Fengyuan Liu, Qian Liu, Wei Cao, Li Jian
Nearly-tight Bounds for Deep Kernel Learning	The generalization analysis of deep kernel learning (DKL) is a crucial and open problem of kernel methods for deep learning. The implicit nonlinear mapping in DKL makes existing methods of capacity-based generalization analysis for deep learning invalid. In an attempt to overcome this challenge and make up for the gap in the generalization theory of DKL, we develop an analysis method based on the composite relationship of function classes and derive capacity-based bounds with mild dependence on the depth, which generalizes learning theory bounds to deep kernels and serves as theoretical guarantees for the generalization of DKL. In this paper, we prove novel and nearly-tight generalization bounds based on the uniform covering number and the Rademacher chaos complexity for deep (multiple) kernel machines. In addition, for some common classes, we estimate their uniform covering numbers and Rademacher chaos complexities by bounding their pseudo-dimensions and kernel pseudo-dimensions, respectively. The mild bounds without strong assumptions partially explain the good generalization ability of deep learning combined with kernel methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23ax	Yifan Zhang, Min-Ling Zhang
DP-Fast MH: Private, Fast, and Accurate Metropolis-Hastings for Large-Scale Bayesian Inference	Bayesian inference provides a principled framework for learning from complex data and reasoning under uncertainty. It has been widely applied in machine learning tasks such as medical diagnosis, drug design, and policymaking. In these common applications, data can be highly sensitive. Differential privacy (DP) offers data analysis tools with powerful worst-case privacy guarantees and has been developed as the leading approach in privacy-preserving data analysis. In this paper, we study Metropolis-Hastings (MH), one of the most fundamental MCMC methods, for large-scale Bayesian inference under differential privacy. While most existing private MCMC algorithms sacrifice accuracy and efficiency to obtain privacy, we provide the first exact and fast DP MH algorithm, using only a minibatch of data in most iterations. We further reveal, for the first time, a three-way trade-off among privacy, scalability (i.e. the batch size), and efficiency (i.e. the convergence rate), theoretically characterizing how privacy affects the utility and computational cost in Bayesian inference. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm in various experiments.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23aw	Wanrong Zhang, Ruqi Zhang
Coder Reviewer Reranking for Code Generation	Sampling diverse programs from a code language model and reranking with model likelihood is a popular method for code generation but it is prone to preferring degenerate solutions. Inspired by collaborative programming, we propose Coder-Reviewer reranking. We augment Coder language models from past work, which generate programs given language instructions, with Reviewer models, which evaluate the likelihood of the instruction given the generated programs. We perform an extensive study across six datasets with eight models from three model families. Experimental results show that Coder-Reviewer reranking leads to consistent and significant improvement (up to 17% absolute accuracy gain) over reranking with the Coder model only. When combined with executability filtering, Coder-Reviewer reranking can often outperform the minimum Bayes risk method. Coder-Reviewer reranking is easy to implement by prompting, can generalize to different programming languages, and works well with off-the-shelf hyperparameters.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23av	Tianyi Zhang, Tao Yu, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Mike Lewis, Wen-Tau Yih, Daniel Fried, Sida Wang
Do You Remember? Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting for Fake Audio Detection	Current fake audio detection algorithms have achieved promising performances on most datasets. However, their performance may be significantly degraded when dealing with audio of a different dataset. The orthogonal weight modification to overcome catastrophic forgetting does not consider the similarity of genuine audio across different datasets. To overcome this limitation, we propose a continual learning algorithm for fake audio detection to overcome catastrophic forgetting, called Regularized Adaptive Weight Modification (RAWM). When fine-tuning a detection network, our approach adaptively computes the direction of weight modification according to the ratio of genuine utterances and fake utterances. The adaptive modification direction ensures the network can effectively detect fake audio on the new dataset while preserving its knowledge of old model, thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In addition, genuine audio collected from quite different acoustic conditions may skew their feature distribution, so we introduce a regularization constraint to force the network to remember the old distribution in this regard. Our method can easily be generalized to related fields, like speech emotion recognition. We also evaluate our approach across multiple datasets and obtain a significant performance improvement on cross-dataset experiments.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23au	Xiaohui Zhang, Jiangyan Yi, Jianhua Tao, Chenglong Wang, Chu Yuan Zhang
Nearly Optimal Competitive Ratio for Online Allocation Problems with Two-sided Resource Constraints and Finite Requests	In this paper, we investigate the online allocation problem of maximizing the overall revenue subject to both lower and upper bound constraints. Compared to the extensively studied online problems with only resource upper bounds, the two-sided constraints affect the prospects of resource consumption more severely. As a result, only limited violations of constraints or pessimistic competitive bounds could be guaranteed. To tackle the challenge, we define a measure of feasibility $\xi^*$ to evaluate the hardness of this problem, and estimate this measurement by an optimization routine with theoretical guarantees. We propose an online algorithm adopting a constructive framework, where we initialize a threshold price vector using the estimation, then dynamically update the price vector and use it for decision-making at each step. It can be shown that the proposed algorithm is $\big(1-O(\frac{\varepsilon}{\xi^*-\varepsilon})\big)$ or $\big(1-O(\frac{\varepsilon}{\xi^*-\sqrt{\varepsilon}})\big)$ competitive with high probability for $\xi^*$ known or unknown respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result establishing a nearly optimal competitive algorithm for solving two-sided constrained online allocation problems with a high probability of feasibility.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23at	Qixin Zhang, Wenbing Ye, Zaiyi Chen, Haoyuan Hu, Enhong Chen, Yu Yang
ReDi: Efficient Learning-Free Diffusion Inference via Trajectory Retrieval	Diffusion models show promising generation capability for a variety of data. Despite their high generation quality, the inference for diffusion models is still time-consuming due to the numerous sampling iterations required. To accelerate the inference, we propose ReDi, a simple yet learning-free Retrieval-based Diffusion sampling framework. From a precomputed knowledge base, ReDi retrieves a trajectory similar to the partially generated trajectory at an early stage of generation, skips a large portion of intermediate steps, and continues sampling from a later step in the retrieved trajectory. We theoretically prove that the generation performance of ReDi is guaranteed. Our experiments demonstrate that ReDi improves the model inference efficiency by 2$\times$ speedup. Furthermore, ReDi is able to generalize well in zero-shot cross-domain image generation such as image stylization. The code and demo for ReDi is available at https://github.com/zkx06111/ReDiffusion.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23as	Kexun Zhang, Xianjun Yang, William Yang Wang, Lei Li
Provable Dynamic Fusion for Low-Quality Multimodal Data	The inherent challenge of multimodal fusion is to precisely capture the cross-modal correlation and flexibly conduct cross-modal interaction. To fully release the value of each modality and mitigate the influence of low-quality multimodal data, dynamic multimodal fusion emerges as a promising learning paradigm. Despite its widespread use, theoretical justifications in this field are still notably lacking. Can we design a provably robust multimodal fusion method? This paper provides theoretical understandings to answer this question under a most popular multimodal fusion framework from the generalization perspective. We proceed to reveal that several uncertainty estimation solutions are naturally available to achieve robust multimodal fusion. Then a novel multimodal fusion framework termed Quality-aware Multimodal Fusion (QMF) is proposed, which can improve the performance in terms of classification accuracy and model robustness. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmarks can support our findings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23ar	Qingyang Zhang, Haitao Wu, Changqing Zhang, Qinghua Hu, Huazhu Fu, Joey Tianyi Zhou, Xi Peng
Demystifying Uneven Vulnerability of Link Stealing Attacks against Graph Neural Networks	While graph neural networks (GNNs) dominate the state-of-the-art for exploring graphs in real-world applications, they have been shown to be vulnerable to a growing number of privacy attacks. For instance, link stealing is a well-known membership inference attack (MIA) on edges that infers the presence of an edge in a GNN's training graph. Recent studies on independent and identically distributed data (e.g., images) have empirically demonstrated that individuals from different groups suffer from different levels of privacy risks to MIAs, i.e., uneven vulnerability. However, theoretical evidence of such uneven vulnerability is missing. In this paper, we first present theoretical evidence of the uneven vulnerability of GNNs to link stealing attacks, which lays the foundation for demystifying such uneven risks among different groups of edges. We further demonstrate a group-based attack paradigm to expose the practical privacy harm to GNN users derived from the uneven vulnerability of edges. Finally, we empirically validate the existence of obvious uneven vulnerability on nine real-world datasets (e.g., about 25% AUC difference between different groups in the Credit graph). Compared with existing methods, the outperformance of our group-based attack paradigm confirms that customising different strategies for different groups results in more effective privacy attacks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23aq	He Zhang, Bang Wu, Shuo Wang, Xiangwen Yang, Minhui Xue, Shirui Pan, Xingliang Yuan
Towards Trustworthy Explanation: On Causal Rationalization	With recent advances in natural language processing, rationalization becomes an essential self-explaining diagram to disentangle the black box by selecting a subset of input texts to account for the major variation in prediction. Yet, existing association-based approaches on rationalization cannot identify true rationales when two or more snippets are highly inter-correlated and thus provide a similar contribution to prediction accuracy, so-called spuriousness. To address this limitation, we novelly leverage two causal desiderata, non-spuriousness and efficiency, into rationalization from the causal inference perspective. We formally define a series of probabilities of causation based on a newly proposed structural causal model of rationalization, with its theoretical identification established as the main component of learning necessary and sufficient rationales. The superior performance of the proposed causal rationalization is demonstrated on real-world review and medical datasets with extensive experiments compared to state-of-the-art methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23ap	Wenbo Zhang, Tong Wu, Yunlong Wang, Yong Cai, Hengrui Cai
ConCerNet: A Contrastive Learning Based Framework for Automated Conservation Law Discovery and Trustworthy Dynamical System Prediction	Deep neural networks (DNN) have shown great capacity of modeling a dynamical system; nevertheless, they usually do not obey physics constraints such as conservation laws. This paper proposes a new learning framework named $\textbf{ConCerNet}$ to improve the trustworthiness of the DNN based dynamics modeling to endow the invariant properties. $\textbf{ConCerNet}$ consists of two steps: (i) a contrastive learning method to automatically capture the system invariants (i.e. conservation properties) along the trajectory observations; (ii) a neural projection layer to guarantee that the learned dynamics models preserve the learned invariants. We theoretically prove the functional relationship between the learned latent representation and the unknown system invariant function. Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms the baseline neural networks in both coordinate error and conservation metrics by a large margin. With neural network based parameterization and no dependence on prior knowledge, our method can be extended to complex and large-scale dynamics by leveraging an autoencoder.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23ao	Wang Zhang, Tsui-Wei Weng, Subhro Das, Alexandre Megretski, Luca Daniel, Lam M.

On the Generalization of Multi-modal Contrastive Learning	Multi-modal contrastive learning (MMCL) has recently garnered considerable interest due to its superior performance in visual tasks, achieved by embedding multi-modal data, such as visual-language pairs. However, there still lack theoretical understandings of how MMCL extracts useful visual representation from multi-modal pairs, and particularly, how MMCL outperforms previous approaches like self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL). In this paper, by drawing an intrinsic connection between MMCL and asymmetric matrix factorization, we establish the first generalization guarantees of MMCL for visual downstream tasks. Based on this framework, we further unify MMCL and SSCL by showing that MMCL implicitly performs SSCL with (pseudo) positive pairs induced by text pairs. Through this unified perspective, we characterize the advantage of MMCL by showing that text pairs induce more semantically consistent and diverse positive pairs, which, according to our analysis, provably benefit downstream generalization. Inspired by this finding, we propose several methods to significantly improve the downstream performance of SSCL on ImageNet by leveraging multi-modal information.

AdaNPC: Exploring Non-Parametric Classifier for Test-Time Adaptation	Many recent machine learning tasks focus to develop models that can generalize to unseen distributions. Domain generalization (DG) has become one of the key topics in various fields. Several literatures show that DG can be arbitrarily hard without exploiting target domain information. To address this issue, test-time adaptive (TTA) methods are proposed. Existing TTA methods require offline target data or extra sophisticated optimization procedures during the inference stage.

On the Convergence of SARSA with Linear Function Approximation	SARSA, a classical on-policy control algorithm for reinforcement learning, is known to chatter when combined with linear function approximation: SARSA does not diverge but oscillates in a bounded region. However, little is known about how fast SARSA converges to that region and how large the region is. In this paper, we make progress towards this open problem by showing the convergence rate of projected SARSA to a bounded region. Importantly, the region is much smaller than the region that we project into, provided that the the magnitude of the reward is not too large. Existing works regarding the convergence of linear SARSA to a fixed point all require the Lipschitz constant of SARSA's policy improvement operator to be sufficiently small; our analysis instead applies to arbitrary Lipschitz constants and thus characterizes the behavior of linear SARSA for a new regime.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23al	Shangtong Zhang, Remi Tachet Des Combes, Romain Laroche
A Category-theoretical Meta-analysis of Definitions of Disentanglement	Disentangling the factors of variation in data is a fundamental concept in machine learning and has been studied in various ways by different researchers, leading to a multitude of definitions. Despite the numerous empirical studies, more theoretical research is needed to fully understand the defining properties of disentanglement and how different definitions relate to each other. This paper presents a meta-analysis of existing definitions of disentanglement, using category theory as a unifying and rigorous framework. We propose that the concepts of the cartesian and monoidal products should serve as the core of disentanglement. With these core concepts, we show the similarities and crucial differences in dealing with (i) functions, (ii) equivariant maps, (iii) relations, and (iv) stochastic maps. Overall, our meta-analysis deepens our understanding of disentanglement and its various formulations and can help researchers navigate different definitions and choose the most appropriate one for their specific context.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23ak	Yivan Zhang, Masashi Sugiyama
Learning Regions of Interest for Bayesian Optimization with Adaptive Level-Set Estimation	We study Bayesian optimization (BO) in high-dimensional and non-stationary scenarios. Existing algorithms for such scenarios typically require extensive hyperparameter tuning, which limits their practical effectiveness. We propose a framework, called BALLET, which adaptively filters for a high-confidence region of interest (ROI) as a superlevel-set of a nonparametric probabilistic model such as a Gaussian process (GP). Our approach is easy to tune, and is able to focus on local region of the optimization space that can be tackled by existing BO methods. The key idea is to use two probabilistic models: a coarse GP to identify the ROI, and a localized GP for optimization within the ROI. We show theoretically that BALLET can efficiently shrink the search space, and can exhibit a tighter regret bound than standard BO without ROI filtering. We demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of BALLET on both synthetic and real-world optimization tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23aj	Fengxue Zhang, Jialin Song, James C Bowden, Alexander Ladd, Yisong Yue, Thomas Desautels, Yuxin Chen
"""Why did the Model Fail?"": Attributing Model Performance Changes to Distribution Shifts"	Machine learning models frequently experience performance drops under distribution shifts. The underlying cause of such shifts may be multiple simultaneous factors such as changes in data quality, differences in specific covariate distributions, or changes in the relationship between label and features. When a model does fail during deployment, attributing performance change to these factors is critical for the model developer to identify the root cause and take mitigating actions. In this work, we introduce the problem of attributing performance differences between environments to distribution shifts in the underlying data generating mechanisms. We formulate the problem as a cooperative game where the players are distributions. We define the value of a set of distributions to be the change in model performance when only this set of distributions has changed between environments, and derive an importance weighting method for computing the value of an arbitrary set of distributions. The contribution of each distribution to the total performance change is then quantified as its Shapley value. We demonstrate the correctness and utility of our method on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world case studies, showing its effectiveness in attributing performance changes to a wide range of distribution shifts.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23ai	Haoran Zhang, Harvineet Singh, Marzyeh Ghassemi, Shalmali Joshi
Optimal Shrinkage for Distributed Second-Order Optimization	In this work, we address the problem of Hessian inversion bias in distributed second-order optimization algorithms. We introduce a novel shrinkage-based estimator for the resolvent of gram matrices which is asymptotically unbiased, and characterize its non-asymptotic convergence rate in the isotropic case. We apply this estimator to bias correction of Newton steps in distributed second-order optimization algorithms, as well as randomized sketching based methods. We examine the bias present in the naive averaging-based distributed Newton's method using analytical expressions and contrast it with our proposed biasfree approach. Our approach leads to significant improvements in convergence rate compared to standard baselines and recent proposals, as shown through experiments on both real and synthetic datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23ah	Fangzhao Zhang, Mert Pilanci
Interactive Object Placement with Reinforcement Learning	Object placement aims to insert a foreground object into a background image with a suitable location and size to create a natural composition. To predict a diverse distribution of placements, existing methods usually establish a one-to-one mapping from random vectors to the placements. However, these random vectors are not interpretable, which prevents users from interacting with the object placement process. To address this problem, we propose an Interactive Object Placement method with Reinforcement Learning, dubbed IOPRE, to make sequential decisions for producing a reasonable placement given an initial location and size of the foreground. We first design a novel action space to flexibly and stably adjust the location and size of the foreground while preserving its aspect ratio. Then, we propose a multi-factor state representation learning method, which integrates composition image features and sinusoidal positional embeddings of the foreground to make decisions for selecting actions. Finally, we design a hybrid reward function that combines placement assessment and the number of steps to ensure that the agent learns to place objects in the most visually pleasing and semantically appropriate location. Experimental results on the OPA dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of plausibility and diversity.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23ag	Shengping Zhang, Quanling Meng, Qinglin Liu, Liqiang Nie, Bineng Zhong, Xiaopeng Fan, Rongrong Ji
Towards Unbiased Training in Federated Open-world Semi-supervised Learning	Federated Semi-supervised Learning (FedSSL) has emerged as a new paradigm for allowing distributed clients to collaboratively train a machine learning model over scarce labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. However, existing works for FedSSL rely on a closed-world assumption that all local training data and global testing data are from seen classes observed in the labeled dataset. It is crucial to go one step further: adapting FL models to an open-world setting, where unseen classes exist in the unlabeled data.

Bi-directional Masks for Efficient N:M Sparse Training	We focus on addressing the dense backward propagation issue for training efficiency of N:M fine-grained sparsity that preserves at most N out of M consecutive weights and achieves practical speedups supported by the N:M sparse tensor core. Therefore, we present a novel method of Bi-directional Masks (Bi-Mask) with its two central innovations in: 1) Separate sparse masks in the two directions of forward and backward propagation to obtain training acceleration. It disentangles the forward and backward weight sparsity and overcomes the very dense gradient computation. 2) An efficient weight row permutation method to maintain performance. It picks up the permutation candidate with the most eligible N:M weight blocks in the backward to minimize the gradient gap between traditional unidirectional masks and our bi-directional masks. Compared with existing uni-directional scenario that applies a transposable mask and enables backward acceleration, our Bi-Mask is experimentally demonstrated to be more superior in performance. Also, our Bi-Mask performs on par with or even better than methods that fail to achieve backward acceleration. Project of this paper is available at https://github.com/zyxxmu/Bi-Mask.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23ae	Yuxin Zhang, Yiting Luo, Mingbao Lin, Yunshan Zhong, Jingjing Xie, Fei Chao, Rongrong Ji
On Enhancing Expressive Power via Compositions of Single Fixed-Size ReLU Network	This paper explores the expressive power of deep neural networks through the framework of function compositions. We demonstrate that the repeated compositions of a single fixed-size ReLU network exhibit surprising expressive power, despite the limited expressive capabilities of the individual network itself. Specifically, we prove by construction that $\mathcal{L}_2\circ \boldsymbol{g}^{\circ r}\circ \boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}}_1$ can approximate $1$-Lipschitz continuous functions on $[0,1]^d$ with an error $\mathcal{O}(r^{-1/d})$, where $\boldsymbol{g}$ is realized by a fixed-size ReLU network, $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}}_1$ and $\mathcal{L}_2$ are two affine linear maps matching the dimensions, and $\boldsymbol{g}^{\circ r}$ denotes the $r$-times composition of $\boldsymbol{g}$. Furthermore, we extend such a result to generic continuous functions on $[0,1]^d$ with the approximation error characterized by the modulus of continuity. Our results reveal that a continuous-depth network generated via a dynamical system has immense approximation power even if its dynamics function is time-independent and realized by a fixed-size ReLU network.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23ad	Shijun Zhang, Jianfeng Lu, Hongkai Zhao
Detecting Adversarial Data by Probing Multiple Perturbations Using Expected Perturbation Score	Adversarial detection aims to determine whether a given sample is an adversarial one based on the discrepancy between natural and adversarial distributions. Unfortunately, estimating or comparing two data distributions is extremely difficult, especially in high-dimension spaces. Recently, the gradient of log probability density (a.k.a., score) w.r.t. the sample is used as an alternative statistic to compute. However, we find that the score is sensitive in identifying adversarial samples due to insufficient information with one sample only. In this paper, we propose a new statistic called expected perturbation score (EPS), which is essentially the expected score of a sample after various perturbations. Specifically, to obtain adequate information regarding one sample, we perturb it by adding various noises to capture its multi-view observations. We theoretically prove that EPS is a proper statistic to compute the discrepancy between two samples under mild conditions. In practice, we can use a pre-trained diffusion model to estimate EPS for each sample. Last, we pro- pose an EPS-based adversarial detection (EPS- AD) method, in which we develop EPS-based maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as a metric to measure the discrepancy between the test sample and natural samples. We also prove that the EPS-based MMD between natural and adversarial samples is larger than that among natural samples. Extensive experiments show the superior adversarial detection performance of our EPS-AD.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23ac	Shuhai Zhang, Feng Liu, Jiahao Yang, Yifan Yang, Changsheng Li, Bo Han, Mingkui Tan
The Wisdom of Hindsight Makes Language Models Better Instruction Followers	Reinforcement learning has seen wide success in finetuning large language models to better align with instructions via human feedback. The so-called algorithm, Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) demonstrates impressive performance on the GPT series models. However, the underlying reinforcement learning algorithm is complex and requires additional training for reward and value networks. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach: converting feedback to instruction by relabeling the original one and training the model for better alignment in a supervised manner. Such an algorithm doesn't require any additional parameters except for the original language model and maximally reuses the pretraining pipeline. To achieve this, we formulate instruction alignment problem for language models as a goal-reaching problem in decision making. We propose Hindsight Instruction Relabeling (HIR), a novel algorithm for aligning language models with instructions. The resulting two-stage algorithm shed light to a family of reward-free approaches that utilize the hindsightly relabeled instructions based on feedback. We evaluate the performance of HIR extensively on 12 challenging BigBench reasoning tasks and show that HIR outperforms the baseline algorithms and is comparable to or even surpasses supervised fine-tuning. The implementation of HIR is available at https://github.com/tianjunz/HIR.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23ab	Tianjun Zhang, Fangchen Liu, Justin Wong, Pieter Abbeel, Joseph E. Gonzalez
No One Idles: Efficient Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Parallel Edge and Server Computation	Federated learning suffers from a latency bottleneck induced by network stragglers, which hampers the training efficiency significantly. In addition, due to the heterogeneous data distribution and security requirements, simple and fast averaging aggregation is not feasible anymore. Instead, complicated aggregation operations, such as knowledge distillation, are required. The time cost for complicated aggregation becomes a new bottleneck that limits the computational efficiency of FL. In this work, we claim that the root cause of training latency actually lies in the aggregation-then-broadcasting workflow of the server. By swapping the computational order of aggregation and broadcasting, we propose a novel and efficient parallel federated learning (PFL) framework that unlocks the edge nodes during global computation and the central server during local computation. This fully asynchronous and parallel pipeline enables handling complex aggregation and network stragglers, allowing flexible device participation as well as achieving scalability in computation. We theoretically prove that synchronous and asynchronous PFL can achieve a similar convergence rate as vanilla FL. Extensive experiments empirically show that our framework brings up to $5.56\times$ speedup compared with traditional FL. Code is available at: https://github.com/Hypervoyager/PFL.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23aa	Feilong Zhang, Xianming Liu, Shiyi Lin, Gang Wu, Xiong Zhou, Junjun Jiang, Xiangyang Ji
Learning Subpocket Prototypes for Generalizable Structure-based Drug Design	Generating molecules with high binding affinities to target proteins (a.k.a. structure-based drug design) is a fundamental and challenging task in drug discovery. Recently, deep generative models have achieved remarkable success in generating 3D molecules conditioned on the protein pocket. However, most existing methods consider molecular generation for protein pockets independently while neglecting the underlying connections such as subpocket-level similarities. Subpockets are the local protein environments of ligand fragments and pockets with similar subpockets may bind the same molecular fragment (motif) even though their overall structures are different. Therefore, the trained models can hardly generalize to unseen protein pockets in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel method DrugGPS for generalizable structure-based drug design. With the biochemical priors, we propose to learn subpocket prototypes and construct a global interaction graph to model the interactions between subpocket prototypes and molecular motifs. Moreover, a hierarchical graph transformer encoder and motif-based 3D molecule generation scheme are used to improve the model's performance. The experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms baselines in generating realistic drug candidates with high affinities in challenging out-of-distribution settings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23z	Zaixi Zhang, Qi Liu
Fed-CBS: A Heterogeneity-Aware Client Sampling Mechanism for Federated Learning via Class-Imbalance Reduction	Due to the often limited communication bandwidth of edge devices, most existing federated learning (FL) methods randomly select only a subset of devices to participate in training at each communication round. Compared with engaging all the available clients, such a random-selection mechanism could lead to significant performance degradation on non-IID (independent and identically distributed) data. In this paper, we present our key observation that the essential reason resulting in such performance degradation is the class-imbalance of the grouped data from randomly selected clients. Based on this observation, we design an efficient heterogeneity-aware client sampling mechanism, namely, Federated Class-balanced Sampling (Fed-CBS), which can effectively reduce class-imbalance of the grouped dataset from the intentionally selected clients. We first propose a measure of class-imbalance which can be derived in a privacy-preserving way. Based on this measure, we design a computation-efficient client sampling strategy such that the actively selected clients will generate a more class-balanced grouped dataset with theoretical guarantees. Experimental results show that Fed-CBS outperforms the status quo approaches in terms of test accuracy and the rate of convergence while achieving comparable or even better performance than the ideal setting where all the available clients participate in the FL training.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23y	Jianyi Zhang, Ang Li, Minxue Tang, Jingwei Sun, Xiang Chen, Fan Zhang, Changyou Chen, Yiran Chen, Hai Li
On the Optimality of Misspecified Kernel Ridge Regression	In the misspecified kernel ridge regression problem, researchers usually assume the underground true function $f_{\rho}^{\star} \in [\mathcal{H}]^{s}$, a less-smooth interpolation space of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) $\mathcal{H}$ for some $s\in (0,1)$. The existing minimax optimal results require $\left\Vert f_{\rho}^{\star} \right \Vert_{L^{\infty}} < \infty$ which implicitly requires $s > \alpha_{0}$ where $\alpha_{0} \in (0,1) $ is the embedding index, a constant depending on $\mathcal{H}$. Whether the KRR is optimal for all $s\in (0,1)$ is an outstanding problem lasting for years. In this paper, we show that KRR is minimax optimal for any $s\in (0,1)$ when the $\mathcal{H}$ is a Sobolev RKHS.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23x	Haobo Zhang, Yicheng Li, Weihao Lu, Qian Lin
FedCR: Personalized Federated Learning Based on Across-Client Common Representation with Conditional Mutual Information Regularization	In personalized federated learning (PFL), multiple clients train customized models to fulfill their personal objectives, which, however, are prone to overfitting to local data due to the heterogeneity and scarcity of local data. To address this, we propose from the information-theoretic perspective a personalized federated learning framework based on the common representation learned across clients, named FedCR. Specifically, we introduce to the local client update a regularizer that aims at minimizing the discrepancy between local and global conditional mutual information (CMI), such that clients are encouraged to learn and exploit the common representation. Upon this, each client learns individually a customized predictor (head), while the extractor (body) remains to be aggregated by the server. Our CMI regularizer leads to a theoretically sound alignment between the local and global stochastic feature distributions in terms of their Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. More importantly, by modeling the global joint feature distribution as a product of multiple local feature distributions, clients can efficiently extract diverse information from the global data but without need of the raw data from other clients. We further show that noise injection via feature alignment and ensemble of local predictors in FedCR would help enhance its generalization capability. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate a consistent performance gain and better generalization behavior of FedCR.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23w	Hao Zhang, Chenglin Li, Wenrui Dai, Junni Zou, Hongkai Xiong
Improving Medical Predictions by Irregular Multimodal Electronic Health Records Modeling	Health conditions among patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are monitored via electronic health records (EHRs), composed of numerical time series and lengthy clinical note sequences, both taken at $\textit{irregular}$ time intervals. Dealing with such irregularity in every modality, and integrating irregularity into multimodal representations to improve medical predictions, is a challenging problem. Our method first addresses irregularity in each single modality by (1) modeling irregular time series by dynamically incorporating hand-crafted imputation embeddings into learned interpolation embeddings via a gating mechanism, and (2) casting a series of clinical note representations as multivariate irregular time series and tackling irregularity via a time attention mechanism. We further integrate irregularity in multimodal fusion with an interleaved attention mechanism across temporal steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to thoroughly model irregularity in multimodalities for improving medical predictions. Our proposed methods for two medical prediction tasks consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in each single modality and multimodal fusion scenarios. Specifically, we observe relative improvements of 6.5%, 3.6%, and 4.3% in F1 for time series, clinical notes, and multimodal fusion, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and the importance of considering irregularity in multimodal EHRs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23v	Xinlu Zhang, Shiyang Li, Zhiyu Chen, Xifeng Yan, Linda Ruth Petzold
Quantum Lower Bounds for Finding Stationary Points of Nonconvex Functions	Quantum computing is an emerging technology that has been rapidly advancing in the past decades. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of quantum lower bounds on finding $\epsilon$-approximate stationary points of nonconvex functions, and we consider the following two important settings: 1) having access to $p$-th order derivatives; or 2) having access to stochastic gradients. The classical query lower bounds are $\Omega\big(\epsilon^{-\frac{1+p}{p}}\big)$ regarding the first setting and $\Omega(\epsilon^{-4})$ regarding the second setting (or $\Omega(\epsilon^{-3})$ if the stochastic gradient function is mean-squared smooth). In this paper, we extend all these classical lower bounds to the quantum setting. They match the classical algorithmic results respectively, demonstrating that there is no quantum speedup for finding $\epsilon$-stationary points of nonconvex functions with $p$-th order derivative inputs or stochastic gradient inputs, whether with or without the mean-squared smoothness assumption. Technically, we prove our quantum lower bounds by showing that the sequential nature of classical hard instances in all these settings also applies to quantum queries, preventing any quantum speedup other than revealing information of the stationary points sequentially.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23u	Chenyi Zhang, Tongyang Li
One-Step Estimator for Permuted Sparse Recovery	This paper considers the unlabeled sparse recovery under multiple measurements, i.e., ${\mathbf{Y}} = {\mathbf{\Pi}}^{\natural} {\mathbf{X}} {\mathbf{B}}^{\natural} + {\mathbf{W}}$, where ${\mathbf{Y}} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}, {\mathbf{\Pi}}^{\natural}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}, {\mathbf{X}} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times p}, {\mathbf{B}} ^{\natural}\in \mathbb{R}^{p\times m}, {\mathbf{W}}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$ represents the observations, missing (or incomplete) correspondence information, sensing matrix, sparse signals, and additive sensing noise, respectively. Different from the previous works on multiple measurements ($m > 1$) which all focus on the sufficient samples regime, namely, $n > p$, we consider a sparse matrix $\mathbf{B}^{\natural}$ and investigate the insufficient samples regime (i.e., $n \ll p$) for the first time.

Adaptive Barrier Smoothing for First-Order Policy Gradient with Contact Dynamics	Differentiable physics-based simulators have witnessed remarkable success in robot learning involving contact dynamics, benefiting from their improved accuracy and efficiency in solving the underlying complementarity problem. However, when utilizing the First-Order Policy Gradient (FOPG) method, our theory indicates that the complementarity-based systems suffer from stiffness, leading to an explosion in the gradient variance of FOPG. As a result, optimization becomes challenging due to chaotic and non-smooth loss landscapes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach called Adaptive Barrier Smoothing (ABS), which introduces a class of softened complementarity systems that correspond to barrier-smoothed objectives. With a contact-aware adaptive central-path parameter, ABS reduces the FOPG gradient variance while controlling the gradient bias. We justify the adaptive design by analyzing the roots of the system's stiffness. Additionally, we establish the convergence of FOPG and show that ABS achieves a reasonable trade-off between the gradient variance and bias by providing their upper bounds. Moreover, we present a variant of FOPG based on complementarity modeling that efficiently fits the contact dynamics by learning the physical parameters. Experimental results on various robotic tasks are provided to support our theory and method.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23s	Shenao Zhang, Wanxin Jin, Zhaoran Wang
CAB: Comprehensive Attention Benchmarking on Long Sequence Modeling	Transformer has achieved remarkable success in language, image, and speech processing. Recently, various efficient attention architectures have been proposed to improve transformer's efficiency while largely preserving its efficacy, especially in modeling long sequences. A widely-used benchmark to test these efficient methods' capability on long-range modeling is Long Range Arena (LRA). However, LRA only focuses on the standard bidirectional (or noncausal) self attention, and completely ignores cross attentions and unidirectional (or causal) attentions, which are equally important to downstream applications. In this paper, we propose Comprehensive Attention Benchmark (CAB) under a fine-grained attention taxonomy with four distinguishable attention patterns, namely, noncausal self, causal self, noncausal cross, and causal cross attentions. CAB collects seven real-world tasks from different research areas to evaluate efficient attentions under the four attention patterns. Among these tasks, CAB validates efficient attentions in eight backbone networks to show their generalization across neural architectures. We conduct exhaustive experiments to benchmark the performances of nine widely-used efficient attention architectures designed with different philosophies on CAB. Extensive experimental results also shed light on the fundamental problems of efficient attentions, such as efficiency length against vanilla attention, performance consistency across attention patterns, the benefit of attention mechanisms, and interpolation/extrapolation on long-context language modeling.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23r	Jun Zhang, Shuyang Jiang, Jiangtao Feng, Lin Zheng, Lingpeng Kong
Towards Coherent Image Inpainting Using Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models	Image inpainting refers to the task of generating a complete, natural image based on a partially revealed reference image. Recently, many research interests have been focused on addressing this problem using fixed diffusion models. These approaches typically directly replace the revealed region of the intermediate or final generated images with that of the reference image or its variants. However, since the unrevealed regions are not directly modified to match the context, it results in incoherence between revealed and unrevealed regions. To address the incoherence problem, a small number of methods introduce a rigorous Bayesian framework, but they tend to introduce mismatches between the generated and the reference images due to the approximation errors in computing the posterior distributions. In this paper, we propose CoPaint, which can coherently inpaint the whole image without introducing mismatches. CoPaint also uses the Bayesian framework to jointly modify both revealed and unrevealed regions but approximates the posterior distribution in a way that allows the errors to gradually drop to zero throughout the denoising steps, thus strongly penalizing any mismatches with the reference image. Our experiments verify that CoPaint can outperform the existing diffusion-based methods under both objective and subjective metrics.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23q	Guanhua Zhang, Jiabao Ji, Yang Zhang, Mo Yu, Tommi Jaakkola, Shiyu Chang
Spatial-Temporal Graph Learning with Adversarial Contrastive Adaptation	Spatial-temporal graph learning has emerged as the state-of-the-art solution for modeling structured spatial-temporal data in learning region representations for various urban sensing tasks (e.g., crime forecasting, traffic flow prediction). However, most existing models are vulnerable to the quality of the generated region graph due to the inartistic graph-structured information aggregation schema. The ubiquitous spatial-temporal data noise and incompleteness in real-life scenarios bring difficulties to generate high-quality region representations. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Adversarial Graph contrastive learning model (STAG) to tackle this challenge for adaptive self-supervised graph augmentation. Specifically, we propose a learnable contrastive learning function that enables the automated distillation of important multi-view self-supervised signals for adaptive spatial-temporal graph augmentation. To enhance the representation discrimination ability and robustness, the designed adversarial contrastive learning mechanism empowers STAG to adaptively identify hard samples for better self-supervision. Finally, a cross-view contrastive learning paradigm is introduced to model the inter-dependencies across view-specific region representations and preserve the underlying relation heterogeneity. We verify the superiority of our STAG method in various spatial-temporal prediction tasks on several benchmark datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23p	Qianru Zhang, Chao Huang, Lianghao Xia, Zheng Wang, Siu Ming Yiu, Ruihua Han
When Sparsity Meets Contrastive Models: Less Graph Data Can Bring Better Class-Balanced Representations	Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful models for non-Euclidean data, but their training is often accentuated by massive unnecessary computation: on the one hand, training on non-Euclidean data has relatively high computational cost due to its irregular density properties; on the other hand, the class imbalance property often associated with non-Euclidean data cannot be alleviated by the massiveness of the data, thus hindering the generalisation of the models. To address the above issues, theoretically, we start with a hypothesis about the effectiveness of using a subset of training data for GNNs, which is guaranteed by the gradient distance between the subset and the full set. Empirically, we also observe that a subset of the data can provide informative gradients for model optimization and which changes over time dynamically. We name this phenomenon dynamic data sparsity. Additionally, we find that pruned sparse contrastive models may miss valuable information, leading to a large loss value on the informative subset. Motivated by the above findings, we develop a unified data model dynamic sparsity framework called Data Decantation (DataDec) to address the above challenges. The key idea of DataDec is to identify the informative subset dynamically during the training process by applying sparse graph contrastive learning. The effectiveness of DataDec is comprehensively evaluated on graph benchmark datasets and we also verify its generalizability on image data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23o	Chunhui Zhang, Chao Huang, Yijun Tian, Qianlong Wen, Zhongyu Ouyang, Youhuan Li, Yanfang Ye, Chuxu Zhang
On the Interplay Between Misspecification and Sub-optimality Gap in Linear Contextual Bandits	We study linear contextual bandits in the misspecified setting, where the expected reward function can be approximated by a linear function class up to a bounded misspecification level $\zeta>0$. We propose an algorithm based on a novel data selection scheme, which only selects the contextual vectors with large uncertainty for online regression. We show that, when the misspecification level $\zeta$ is dominated by $\tilde O(\Delta / \sqrt{d})$ with $\Delta$ being the minimal sub-optimality gap and $d$ being the dimension of the contextual vectors, our algorithm enjoys the same gap-dependent regret bound $\tilde O ({d^2} /{\Delta})$ as in the well-specified setting up to logarithmic factors. Given this result, we show that the existing SupLinUCB algorithm (Chu et al., 2011) can also achieve a gap-dependent constant regret bound without the knowledge of sub-optimality gap $\Delta$. Together with a lower bound adapted from Lattimore et al. (2020), our result suggests an interplay between the misspecification level and the sub-optimality gap: (1) the linear contextual bandit model is efficiently learnable when $\zeta \leq \tilde O({\Delta} / \sqrt{d})$; and (2) it is not efficiently learnable when $\zeta \geq \tilde \Omega({\Delta} / {\sqrt{d}})$. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate our theoretical results.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23n	Weitong Zhang, Jiafan He, Zhiyuan Fan, Quanquan Gu
Prompting Large Language Model for Machine Translation: A Case Study	Research on prompting has shown excellent performance with little or even no supervised training across many tasks. However, prompting for machine translation is still under-explored in the literature. We fill this gap by offering a systematic study on prompting strategies for translation, examining various factors for prompt template and demonstration example selection. We further explore the use of monolingual data and the feasibility of cross-lingual, cross-domain, and sentence-to-document transfer learning in prompting. Extensive experiments with GLM-130B (Zeng et al., 2022) as the testbed show that 1) the number and the quality of prompt examples matter, where using suboptimal examples degenerates translation; 2) several features of prompt examples, such as semantic similarity, show significant Spearman correlation with their prompting performance; yet, none of the correlations are strong enough; 3) using pseudo parallel prompt examples constructed from monolingual data via zero-shot prompting could improve translation; and 4) improved performance is achievable by transferring knowledge from prompt examples selected in other settings. We finally provide an analysis on the model outputs and discuss several problems that prompting still suffers from.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23m	Biao Zhang, Barry Haddow, Alexandra Birch
Crafting Training Degradation Distribution for the Accuracy-Generalization Trade-off in Real-World Super-Resolution	Super-resolution (SR) techniques designed for real-world applications commonly encounter two primary challenges: generalization performance and restoration accuracy. We demonstrate that when methods are trained using complex, large-range degradations to enhance generalization, a decline in accuracy is inevitable. However, since the degradation in a certain real-world applications typically exhibits a limited variation range, it becomes feasible to strike a trade-off between generalization performance and testing accuracy within this scope. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to craft training degradation distributions using a small set of reference images. Our strategy is founded upon the binned representation of the degradation space and the Frechet distance between degradation distributions. Our results indicate that the proposed technique significantly improves the performance of test images while preserving generalization capabilities in real-world applications.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23l	Ruofan Zhang, Jinjin Gu, Haoyu Chen, Chao Dong, Yulun Zhang, Wenming Yang
A Complete Expressiveness Hierarchy for Subgraph GNNs via Subgraph Weisfeiler-Lehman Tests	Recently, subgraph GNNs have emerged as an important direction for developing expressive graph neural networks (GNNs). While numerous architectures have been proposed, so far there is still a limited understanding of how various design paradigms differ in terms of expressive power, nor is it clear what design principle achieves maximal expressiveness with minimal architectural complexity. To address these fundamental questions, this paper conducts a systematic study of general node-based subgraph GNNs through the lens of Subgraph Weisfeiler-Lehman Tests (SWL). Our central result is to build a complete hierarchy of SWL with strictly growing expressivity. Concretely, we prove that any node-based subgraph GNN falls into one of the six SWL equivalence classes, among which $\mathsf{SSWL}$ achieves the maximal expressive power. We also study how these equivalence classes differ in terms of their practical expressiveness such as encoding graph distance and biconnectivity. In addition, we give a tight expressivity upper bound of all SWL algorithms by establishing a close relation with localized versions of WL and Folklore WL (FWL) tests. Overall, our results provide insights into the power of existing subgraph GNNs, guide the design of new architectures, and point out their limitations by revealing an inherent gap with the 2-FWL test. Finally, experiments demonstrate that $\mathsf{SSWL}$-inspired subgraph GNNs can significantly outperform prior architectures on multiple benchmarks despite great simplicity.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23k	Bohang Zhang, Guhao Feng, Yiheng Du, Di He, Liwei Wang

Rethink DARTS Search Space and Renovate a New Benchmark	DARTS search space (DSS) has become a canonical benchmark for NAS whereas some emerging works pointed out the issue of narrow accuracy range and claimed it would hurt the method ranking. We observe some recent studies already suffer from this issue that overshadows the meaning of scores. In this work, we first propose and orchestrate a suite of improvements to frame a larger and harder DSS, termed LHD, while retaining high efficiency in search. We step forward to renovate a LHD-based new benchmark, taking care of both discernibility and accessibility. Specifically, we re-implement twelve baselines and evaluate them across twelve conditions by combining two underexpolored influential factors: transductive robustness and discretization policy, to reasonably construct a benchmark upon multi-condition evaluation. Considering that the tabular benchmarks are always insufficient to adequately evaluate the methods of neural architecture search (NAS), our work can serve as a crucial basis for the future progress of NAS.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23i	Jiuling Zhang, Zhiming Ding
CataBEEM: Integrating Latent Interaction Categories in Node-wise Community Detection Models for Network Data	Community detection is a fundamental task in network analysis. Learning underlying network structures has brought deep insights into the understanding of complex systems. While many methods have focused on clustering nodes into blocks, few accounts for the fact that interactions may exhibit edge-level clustering, which we call categories. Real network data often arise via a series of interactions. Interactions in complex systems can often be clustered into different categories and node-level community structures that depend on the category. In this paper, we introduce a category-and-block edge exchangeable model (CataBEEM) to study interaction networks with joint latent interaction-level category and node-level community structures. In particular, the proposed method models the network from the interaction process perspective and allows the incorporation of prior knowledge from auxiliary interaction-wise information. We derive an efficient variational inference algorithm that can be applied to networks consisting of millions of interactions and provide the theoretical bound of the misspecification rate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various simulation settings and apply the method to TalkLife data, a large-scale online peer-to-peer support network. We show CataBEEM detects more temporally consistent community structures and has better predictions than other methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23h	Yuhua Zhang, Walter H. Dempsey
Tractable Control for Autoregressive Language Generation	Despite the success of autoregressive large language models in text generation, it remains a major challenge to generate text that satisfies complex constraints: sampling from the conditional distribution ${\Pr}(\text{text} | \alpha)$ is intractable for even the simplest lexical constraints $\alpha$. To overcome this challenge, we propose to use tractable probabilistic models (TPMs) to impose lexical constraints in autoregressive text generation models, which we refer to as GeLaTo (Generating Language with Tractable Constraints). To demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, we use distilled hidden Markov models, where we can efficiently compute ${\Pr}(\text{text} | \alpha)$, to guide autoregressive generation from GPT2. GeLaTo achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks for constrained text generation (e.g., CommonGen), beating various strong baselines by a large margin. Our work not only opens up new avenues for controlling large language models but also motivates the development of more expressive TPMs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23g	Honghua Zhang, Meihua Dang, Nanyun Peng, Guy Van Den Broeck
Effective Minkowski Dimension of Deep Nonparametric Regression: Function Approximation and Statistical Theories	Existing theories on deep nonparametric regression have shown that when the input data lie on a low-dimensional manifold, deep neural networks can adapt to the intrinsic data structures. In real world applications, such an assumption of data lying exactly on a low dimensional manifold is stringent. This paper introduces a relaxed assumption that the input data are concentrated around a subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ denoted by $\mathcal{S}$, and the intrinsic dimension of $\mathcal{S}$ can be characterized by a new complexity notation – effective Minkowski dimension. We prove that, the sample complexity of deep nonparametric regression only depends on the effective Minkowski dimension of $\mathcal{S}$ denoted by $p$. We further illustrate our theoretical findings by considering nonparametric regression with an anisotropic Gaussian random design $N(0,\Sigma)$, where $\Sigma$ is full rank. When the eigenvalues of $\Sigma$ have an exponential or polynomial decay, the effective Minkowski dimension of such an Gaussian random design is $p=\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\log n})$ or $p=\mathcal{O}(n^\gamma)$, respectively, where $n$ is the sample size and $\gamma\in(0,1)$ is a small constant depending on the polynomial decay rate. Our theory shows that, when the manifold assumption does not hold, deep neural networks can still adapt to the effective Minkowski dimension of the data, and circumvent the curse of the ambient dimensionality for moderate sample sizes.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23f	Zixuan Zhang, Minshuo Chen, Mengdi Wang, Wenjing Liao, Tuo Zhao
Graph Contrastive Backdoor Attacks	Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has attracted considerable interest due to its impressive node representation learning capability.

In particular, we propose	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23e	Hangfan Zhang, Jinghui Chen, Lu Lin, Jinyuan Jia, Dinghao Wu
Matrix Estimation for Individual Fairness	In recent years, multiple notions of algorithmic fairness have arisen. One such notion is individual fairness (IF), which requires that individuals who are similar receive similar treatment. In parallel, matrix estimation (ME) has emerged as a natural paradigm for handling noisy data with missing values. In this work, we connect the two concepts. We show that pre-processing data using ME can improve an algorithm's IF without sacrificing performance. Specifically, we show that using a popular ME method known as singular value thresholding (SVT) to pre-process the data provides a strong IF guarantee under appropriate conditions. We then show that, under analogous conditions, SVT pre-processing also yields estimates that are consistent and approximately minimax optimal. As such, the ME pre-processing step does not, under the stated conditions, increase the prediction error of the base algorithm, i.e., does not impose a fairness-performance trade-off. We verify these results on synthetic and real data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23d	Cindy Zhang, Sarah Huiyi Cen, Devavrat Shah
Nonparametric Iterative Machine Teaching	In this paper, we consider the problem of Iterative Machine Teaching (IMT), where the teacher provides examples to the learner iteratively such that the learner can achieve fast convergence to a target model. However, existing IMT algorithms are solely based on parameterized families of target models. They mainly focus on convergence in the parameter space, resulting in difficulty when the target models are defined to be functions without dependency on parameters. To address such a limitation, we study a more general task – Nonparametric Iterative Machine Teaching (NIMT), which aims to teach nonparametric target models to learners in an iterative fashion. Unlike parametric IMT that merely operates in the parameter space, we cast NIMT as a functional optimization problem in the function space. To solve it, we propose both random and greedy functional teaching algorithms. We obtain the iterative teaching dimension (ITD) of the random teaching algorithm under proper assumptions, which serves as a uniform upper bound of ITD in NIMT. Further, the greedy teaching algorithm has a significantly lower ITD, which reaches a tighter upper bound of ITD in NIMT. Finally, we verify the correctness of our theoretical findings with extensive experiments in nonparametric scenarios.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23c	Chen Zhang, Xiaofeng Cao, Weiyang Liu, Ivor Tsang, James Kwok

Offline Learning in Markov Games with General Function Approximation	"We study offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) in Markov games, where the goal is to learn an approximate equilibrium—such as Nash equilibrium and (Coarse) Correlated Equilibrium—from an offline dataset pre-collected from the game. Existing works consider relatively restricted tabular or linear models and handle each equilibria separately. In this work, we provide the first framework for sample-efficient offline learning in Markov games under general function approximation, handling all 3 equilibria in a unified manner. By using Bellman-consistent pessimism, we obtain interval estimation for policies' returns, and use both the upper and the lower bounds to obtain a relaxation on the gap of a candidate policy, which becomes our optimization objective. Our results generalize prior works and provide several additional insights. Importantly, we require a data coverage condition that improves over the recently proposed ""unilateral concentrability"". Our condition allows selective coverage of deviation policies that optimally trade-off between their greediness (as approximate best responses) and coverage, and we show scenarios where this leads to significantly better guarantees. As a new connection, we also show how our algorithmic framework can subsume seemingly different solution concepts designed for the special case of two-player zero-sum games."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zhang23a	Yuheng Zhang, Yu Bai, Nan Jiang
Stabilizing Transformer Training by Preventing Attention Entropy Collapse	Training stability is of great importance to Transformers. In this work, we investigate the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers. In particular, we track the attention entropy for each attention head during the course of training, which is a proxy for model sharpness. We identify a common pattern across different architectures and tasks, where low attention entropy is accompanied by high training instability, which can take the form of oscillating loss or divergence. We denote the pathologically low attention entropy, corresponding to highly concentrated attention scores, as $\textit{entropy collapse}$. As a remedy, we propose $\sigma$Reparam, a simple and efficient solution where we reparametrize all linear layers with spectral normalization and an additional learned scalar. We demonstrate that $\sigma$Reparam successfully prevents entropy collapse in the attention layers, promoting more stable training. Additionally, we prove a tight lower bound of the attention entropy, which decreases exponentially fast with the spectral norm of the attention logits, providing additional motivation for our approach. We conduct experiments with $\sigma$Reparam on image classification, image self-supervised learning, machine translation, speech recognition, and language modeling tasks. We show that $\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training (a) a Vision Transformer to competitive performance without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers; (b) deep architectures in machine translation and (c) speech recognition to competitive performance without warmup and adaptive optimizers.

Generative Graph Dictionary Learning	Dictionary learning, which approximates data samples by a set of shared atoms, is a fundamental task in representation learning. However, dictionary learning over graphs, namely graph dictionary learning (GDL), is much more challenging than vectorial data as graphs lie in disparate metric spaces. The sparse literature on GDL formulates the problem from the reconstructive view and often learns linear graph embeddings with a high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) Mixture Model named FraMe to address the GDL problem from the generative view. Equipped with the graph generation function based on the radial basis function kernel and FGW distance, FraMe generates nonlinear embedding spaces, which, as we theoretically proved, provide a good approximation of the original graph spaces. A fast solution is further proposed on top of the expectation-maximization algorithm with guaranteed convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained node and graph embeddings, and our algorithm achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zeng23c	Zhichen Zeng, Ruike Zhu, Yinglong Xia, Hanqing Zeng, Hanghang Tong
Attribute-Efficient PAC Learning of Low-Degree Polynomial Threshold Functions with Nasty Noise	The concept class of low-degree polynomial threshold functions (PTFs) plays a fundamental role in machine learning. In this paper, we study PAC learning of $K$-sparse degree-$d$ PTFs on $\mathbb{R}^n$, where any such concept depends only on $K$ out of $n$ attributes of the input. Our main contribution is a new algorithm that runs in time $({nd}/{\epsilon})^{O(d)}$ and under the Gaussian marginal distribution, PAC learns the class up to error rate $\epsilon$ with $O(\frac{K^{4d}}{\epsilon^{2d}} \cdot \log^{5d} n)$ samples even when an $\eta \leq O(\epsilon^d)$ fraction of them are corrupted by the nasty noise of Bshouty et al. (2002), possibly the strongest corruption model. Prior to this work, attribute-efficient robust algorithms are established only for the special case of sparse homogeneous halfspaces. Our key ingredients are: 1) a structural result that translates the attribute sparsity to a sparsity pattern of the Chow vector under the basis of Hermite polynomials, and 2) a novel attribute-efficient robust Chow vector estimation algorithm which uses exclusively a restricted Frobenius norm to either certify a good approximation or to validate a sparsity-induced degree-$2d$ polynomial as a filter to detect corrupted samples.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zeng23b	Shiwei Zeng, Jie Shen
LookupFFN: Making Transformers Compute-lite for CPU inference	While GPU clusters are the de facto choice for training large deep neural network (DNN) models today, several reasons including ease of workflow, security and cost have led to efforts investigating whether CPUs may be viable for inference in routine use in many sectors of the industry. But the imbalance between the compute capabilities of GPUs and CPUs is huge. Motivated by these considerations, we study a module which is a workhorse within modern DNN architectures, GEMM based Feed Forward Networks (FFNs), and assess the extent to which it can be made compute- (or FLOP-) lite. Specifically, we propose an alternative formulation (we call it LookupFFN) to GEMM based FFNs inspired by the recent studies of using Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to approximate FFNs. Our formulation recasts most essential operations as a memory look-up, leveraging the trade-off between the two resources on any platform: compute and memory (since CPUs offer it in abundance). For RoBERTa language model pretraining, our formulation achieves similar performance compared to GEMM based FFNs, while dramatically reducing the required FLOP. Our development is complemented with a detailed hardware profiling of strategies that will maximize efficiency – not just on contemporary hardware but on products that will be offered in the near/medium term future.

Sequential Counterfactual Risk Minimization	"Counterfactual Risk Minimization (CRM) is a framework for dealing with the logged bandit feedback problem, where the goal is to improve a logging policy using offline data. In this paper, we explore the case where it is possible to deploy learned policies multiple times and acquire new data. We extend the CRM principle and its theory to this scenario, which we call ""Sequential Counterfactual Risk Minimization (SCRM)."" We introduce a novel counterfactual estimator and identify conditions that can improve the performance of CRM in terms of excess risk and regret rates, by using an analysis similar to restart strategies in accelerated optimization methods. We also provide an empirical evaluation of our method in both discrete and continuous action settings, and demonstrate the benefits of multiple deployments of CRM."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zenati23a	Houssam Zenati, Eustache Diemert, Matthieu Martin, Julien Mairal, Pierre Gaillard
On Distribution Dependent Sub-Logarithmic Query Time of Learned Indexing	A fundamental problem in data management is to find the elements in an array that match a query. Recently, learned indexes are being extensively used to solve this problem, where they learn a model to predict the location of the items in the array. They are empirically shown to outperform non-learned methods (e.g., B-trees or binary search that answer queries in $O(\log n)$ time) by orders of magnitude. However, success of learned indexes has not been theoretically justified. Only existing attempt shows the same query time of $O(\log n)$, but with a constant factor improvement in space complexity over non-learned methods, under some assumptions on data distribution. In this paper, we significantly strengthen this result, showing that under mild assumptions on data distribution, and the same space complexity as non-learned methods, learned indexes can answer queries in $O(\log\log n)$ expected query time. We also show that allowing for slightly larger but still near-linear space overhead, a learned index can achieve $O(1)$ expected query time. Our results theoretically prove learned indexes are orders of magnitude faster than non-learned methods, theoretically grounding their empirical success.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zeighami23a	Sepanta Zeighami, Cyrus Shahabi
When is Realizability Sufficient for Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning?	Understanding when reinforcement learning algorithms can make successful off-policy predictions—and when the may fail to do so–remains an open problem. Typically, model-free algorithms for reinforcement learning are analyzed under a condition called Bellman completeness when they operate off-policy with function approximation, unless additional conditions are met. However, Bellman completeness is a requirement that is much stronger than realizability and that is deemed to be too strong to hold in practice. In this work, we relax this structural assumption and analyze the statistical complexity of off-policy reinforcement learning when only realizability holds for the prescribed function class. We establish finite-sample guarantees for off-policy reinforcement learning that are free of the approximation error term known as inherent Bellman error, and that depend on the interplay of three factors. The first two are well known: they are the metric entropy of the function class and the concentrability coefficient that represents the cost of learning off-policy. The third factor is new, and it measures the violation of Bellman completeness, namely the mis-alignment between the chosen function class and its image through the Bellman operator. Our analysis directly applies to the solution found by temporal difference algorithms when they converge.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zanette23a	Andrea Zanette
Bayesian Estimation of Differential Privacy	Algorithms such as Differentially Private SGD enable training machine learning models with formal privacy guarantees. However, because these guarantees hold with respect to unrealistic adversaries, the protection afforded against practical attacks is typically much better. An emerging strand of work empirically estimates the protection afforded by differentially private training as a confidence interval for the privacy budget $\hat{\varepsilon}$ spent with respect to specific threat models. Existing approaches derive confidence intervals for $\hat{\varepsilon}$ from confidence intervals for false positive and false negative rates of membership inference attacks, which requires training an impractically large number of models to get intervals that can be acted upon. We propose a novel, more efficient Bayesian approach that brings privacy estimates within the reach of practitioners. Our approach reduces sample size by computing a posterior for $\hat{\varepsilon}$ (not just a confidence interval) from the joint posterior of the false positive and false negative rates of membership inference attacks. We implement an end-to-end system for privacy estimation that integrates our approach and state-of-the-art membership inference attacks, and evaluate it on text and vision classification tasks. For the same number of samples, we see a reduction in interval width of up to 40% compared to prior work.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zanella-beguelin23a	Santiago Zanella-Beguelin, Lukas Wutschitz, Shruti Tople, Ahmed Salem, Victor Rühle, Andrew Paverd, Mohammad Naseri, Boris Köpf, Daniel Jones
KDEformer: Accelerating Transformers via Kernel Density Estimation	Dot-product attention mechanism plays a crucial role in modern deep architectures (e.g., Transformer) for sequence modeling, however, naïve exact computation of this model incurs quadratic time and memory complexities in sequence length, hindering the training of long-sequence models. Critical bottlenecks are due to the computation of partition functions in the denominator of softmax function as well as the multiplication of the softmax matrix with the matrix of values. Our key observation is that the former can be reduced to a variant of the kernel density estimation (KDE) problem, and an efficient KDE solver can be further utilized to accelerate the latter via subsampling-based fast matrix products. Our proposed KDEformer can approximate the attention in sub-quadratic time with provable spectral norm bounds, while all prior results merely provide entry-wise error bounds. Empirically, we verify that KDEformer outperforms other attention approximations in terms of accuracy, memory, and arithmetic operations on various pre-trained models. For instance, on BigGAN image generation we achieve better generative scores than the exact computation with over 4× speedup. For ImageNet classification with T2T-ViT, KDEformer shows over 18× speedup while the accuracy drop is less than 0.5%.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zandieh23a	Amir Zandieh, Insu Han, Majid Daliri, Amin Karbasi
Conformal Prediction with Missing Values	Conformal prediction is a theoretically grounded framework for constructing predictive intervals. We study conformal prediction with missing values in the covariates – a setting that brings new challenges to uncertainty quantification. We first show that the marginal coverage guarantee of conformal prediction holds on imputed data for any missingness distribution and almost all imputation functions. However, we emphasize that the average coverage varies depending on the pattern of missing values: conformal methods tend to construct prediction intervals that under-cover the response conditionally to some missing patterns. This motivates our novel generalized conformalized quantile regression framework, missing data augmentation, which yields prediction intervals that are valid conditionally to the patterns of missing values, despite their exponential number. We then show that a universally consistent quantile regression algorithm trained on the imputed data is Bayes optimal for the pinball risk, thus achieving valid coverage conditionally to any given data point. Moreover, we examine the case of a linear model, which demonstrates the importance of our proposal in overcoming the heteroskedasticity induced by missing values. Using synthetic and data from critical care, we corroborate our theory and report improved performance of our methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/zaffran23a	Margaux Zaffran, Aymeric Dieuleveut, Julie Josse, Yaniv Romano
Traversing Between Modes in Function Space for Fast Ensembling	"Deep ensemble is a simple yet powerful way to improve the performance of deep neural networks. Under this motivation, recent works on mode connectivity have shown that parameters of ensembles are connected by low-loss subspaces, and one can efficiently collect ensemble parameters in those subspaces. While this provides a way to efficiently train ensembles, for inference, multiple forward passes should still be executed using all the ensemble parameters, which often becomes a serious bottleneck for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose a novel framework to reduce such costs. Given a low-loss subspace connecting two modes of a neural network, we build an additional neural network that predicts the output of the original neural network evaluated at a certain point in the low-loss subspace. The additional neural network, which we call a ""bridge"", is a lightweight network that takes minimal features from the original network and predicts outputs for the low-loss subspace without forward passes through the original network. We empirically demonstrate that we can indeed train such bridge networks and significantly reduce inference costs with the help of bridge networks."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yun23a	Eunggu Yun, Hyungi Lee, Giung Nam, Juho Lee

On the Power of Foundation Models	With infinitely many high-quality data points, infinite computational power, an infinitely large foundation model with a perfect training algorithm and guaranteed zero generalization error on the pretext task, can the model be used for everything? This question cannot be answered by the existing theory of representation, optimization or generalization, because the issues they mainly investigate are assumed to be nonexistent here. In this paper, we show that category theory provides powerful machinery to answer this question. We have proved three results. The first one limits the power of prompt-based learning, saying that the model can solve a downstream task with prompts if and only if the task is representable. The second one says fine tuning does not have this limit, as a foundation model with the minimum required power (up to symmetry) can theoretically solve downstream tasks for the category defined by pretext task, with fine tuning and enough resources. Our final result can be seen as a new type of generalization theorem, showing that the foundation model can generate unseen objects from the target category (e.g., images) using the structural information from the source category (e.g., texts). Along the way, we provide a categorical framework for supervised and self-supervised learning, which might be of independent interest.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yuan23b	Yang Yuan
Coordinate Descent Methods for Fractional Minimization	We consider a class of structured fractional minimization problems, in which the numerator part of the objective is the sum of a differentiable convex function and a convex non-smooth function, while the denominator part is a convex or concave function. This problem is difficult to solve since it is non-convex. By exploiting the structure of the problem, we propose two Coordinate Descent (CD) methods for solving this problem. The proposed methods iteratively solve a one-dimensional subproblem	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yuan23a	Ganzhao Yuan
Master-ASR: Achieving Multilingual Scalability and Low-Resource Adaptation in ASR with Modular Learning	Despite the impressive performance recently achieved by automatic speech recognition (ASR), we observe two primary challenges that hinder its broader applications: (1) The difficulty of introducing scalability into the model to support more languages with limited training, inference, and storage overhead; (2) The low-resource adaptation ability that enables effective low-resource adaptation while avoiding over fitting and catastrophic forgetting issues. Inspired by recent findings, we hypothesize that we can address the above challenges with modules widely shared across languages. To this end, we propose an ASR framework, dubbed Master-ASR, that, for the first time, simultaneously achieves strong multilingual scalability and low-resource adaptation ability thanks to its modularize-then-assemble strategy. Specifically, Master-ASR learns a small set of generalizable sub-modules and adaptively assembles them for different languages to reduce the multilingual overhead and enable effective knowledge transfer for low-resource adaptation. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that Master-ASR can effectively discover language similarity and improve multilingual and low-resource ASR performance over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, e.g., under multilingual-ASR, our framework achieves a 0.13∼2.41 lower character error rate (CER) with 30% smaller inference overhead over SOTA solutions on multilingual ASR and a comparable CER with nearly 100 times fewer trainable parameters over SOTA solutions on low-resource tuning, respectively.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yu23l	Zhongzhi Yu, Yang Zhang, Kaizhi Qian, Cheng Wan, Yonggan Fu, Yongan Zhang, Yingyan Celine Lin
Actor-Critic Alignment for Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning	Deep offline reinforcement learning has recently demonstrated considerable promises in leveraging offline datasets, providing high-quality models that significantly reduce the online interactions required for fine-tuning. However, such a benefit is often diminished due to the marked state-action distribution shift, which causes significant bootstrap error and wipes out the good initial policy. Existing solutions resort to constraining the policy shift or balancing the sample replay based on their online-ness. However, they require online estimation of distribution divergence or density ratio. To avoid such complications, we propose deviating from existing actor-critic approaches that directly transfer the state-action value functions. Instead, we post-process them by aligning with the offline learned policy, so that the $Q$-values for actions	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yu23k	Zishun Yu, Xinhua Zhang
On the Global Convergence of Risk-Averse Policy Gradient Methods with Expected Conditional Risk Measures	Risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) has become a popular tool to control the risk of uncertain outcomes and ensure reliable performance in various sequential decision-making problems. While policy gradient methods have been developed for risk-sensitive RL, it remains unclear if these methods enjoy the same global convergence guarantees as in the risk-neutral case. In this paper, we consider a class of dynamic time-consistent risk measures, called Expected Conditional Risk Measures (ECRMs), and derive policy gradient updates for ECRM-based objective functions. Under both constrained direct parameterization and unconstrained softmax parameterization, we provide global convergence and iteration complexities of the corresponding risk-averse policy gradient algorithms. We further test risk-averse variants of REINFORCE and actor-critic algorithms to demonstrate the efficacy of our method and the importance of risk control.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yu23j	Xian Yu, Lei Ying
Efficient and Equivariant Graph Networks for Predicting Quantum Hamiltonian	We consider the prediction of the Hamiltonian matrix, which finds use in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. Efficiency and equivariance are two important, but conflicting factors. In this work, we propose a SE(3)-equivariant network, named QHNet, that achieves efficiency and equivariance. Our key advance lies at the innovative design of QHNet architecture, which not only obeys the underlying symmetries, but also enables the reduction of number of tensor products by 92%. In addition, QHNet prevents the exponential growth of channel dimension when more atom types are involved. We perform experiments on MD17 datasets, including four molecular systems. Experimental results show that our QHNet can achieve comparable performance to the state of the art methods at a significantly faster speed. Besides, our QHNet consumes 50% less memory due to its streamlined architecture. Our code is publicly available as part of the AIRS library (https://github.com/divelab/AIRS).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yu23i	Haiyang Yu, Zhao Xu, Xiaofeng Qian, Xiaoning Qian, Shuiwang Ji
SeedGNN: Graph Neural Network for Supervised Seeded Graph Matching	There is a growing interest in designing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for seeded graph matching, which aims to match two unlabeled graphs using only topological information and a small set of seed nodes. However, most previous GNNs for this task use a semi-supervised approach, which requires a large number of seeds and cannot learn knowledge that is transferable to unseen graphs. In contrast, this paper proposes a new supervised approach that can learn from a training set how to match unseen graphs with only a few seeds. Our SeedGNN architecture incorporates several novel designs, inspired by theoretical studies of seeded graph matching: 1) it can learn to compute and use witness-like information from different hops, in a way that can be generalized to graphs of different sizes; 2) it can use easily-matched node-pairs as new seeds to improve the matching in subsequent layers. We evaluate SeedGNN on synthetic and real-world graphs and demonstrate significant performance improvements over both non-learning and learning algorithms in the existing literature. Furthermore, our experiments confirm that the knowledge learned by SeedGNN from training graphs can be generalized to test graphs of different sizes and categories.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yu23h	Liren Yu, Jiaming Xu, Xiaojun Lin
CodeIPPrompt: Intellectual Property Infringement Assessment of Code Language Models	Recent advances in large language models (LMs) have facilitated their ability to synthesize programming code. However, they have also raised concerns about intellectual property (IP) rights violations. Despite the significance of this issue, it has been relatively less explored. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap by presenting CodeIPPrompt, a platform for automatic evaluation of the extent to which code language models may reproduce licensed programs. It comprises two key components: prompts constructed from a licensed code database to elicit LMs to generate IP-violating code, and a measurement tool to evaluate the extent of IP violation of code LMs. We conducted an extensive evaluation of existing open-source code LMs and commercial products and revealed the prevalence of IP violations in all these models. We further identified that the root cause is the substantial proportion of training corpus subject to restrictive licenses, resulting from both intentional inclusion and inconsistent license practice in the real world. To address this issue, we also explored potential mitigation strategies, including fine-tuning and dynamic token filtering. Our study provides a testbed for evaluating the IP violation issues of the existing code generation platforms and stresses the need for a better mitigation strategy.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yu23g	Zhiyuan Yu, Yuhao Wu, Ning Zhang, Chenguang Wang, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik, Chaowei Xiao
Adversarial Parameter Attack on Deep Neural Networks	The parameter perturbation attack is a safety threat to deep learning, where small parameter perturbations are made such that the attacked network gives wrong or desired labels of the adversary to specified inputs. However, such attacks could be detected by the user, because the accuracy of the attacked network will reduce and the network cannot work normally. To make the attack more stealthy, in this paper, the adversarial parameter attack is proposed, in which small perturbations to the parameters of the network are made such that the accuracy of the attacked network does not decrease much, but its robustness against adversarial example attacks becomes much lower. As a consequence, the attacked network performs normally on standard samples, but is much more vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The existence of nearly perfect adversarial parameters under $L_\infty$ norm and $L_0$ norm is proved under reasonable conditions. Algorithms are given which can be used to produce high quality adversarial parameters for the commonly used networks trained with various robust training methods, in that the robustness of the attacked networks decreases significantly when they are evaluated using various adversarial attack methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yu23f	Lijia Yu, Yihan Wang, Xiao-Shan Gao
Long-Term Rhythmic Video Soundtracker	We consider the problem of generating musical soundtracks in sync with rhythmic visual cues. Most existing works rely on pre-defined music representations, leading to the incompetence of generative flexibility and complexity. Other methods directly generating video-conditioned waveforms suffer from limited scenarios, short lengths, and unstable generation quality. To this end, we present Long-Term Rhythmic Video Soundtracker (LORIS), a novel framework to synthesize long-term conditional waveforms. Specifically, our framework consists of a latent conditional diffusion probabilistic model to perform waveform synthesis. Furthermore, a series of context-aware conditioning encoders are proposed to take temporal information into consideration for a long-term generation. Notably, we extend our model's applicability from dances to multiple sports scenarios such as floor exercise and figure skating. To perform comprehensive evaluations, we establish a benchmark for rhythmic video soundtracks including the pre-processed dataset, improved evaluation metrics, and robust generative baselines. Extensive experiments show that our model generates long-term soundtracks with state-of-the-art musical quality and rhythmic correspondence. Codes are available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/LORIS.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yu23e	Jiashuo Yu, Yaohui Wang, Xinyuan Chen, Xiao Sun, Yu Qiao
Discover-Then-Rank Unlabeled Support Vectors in the Dual Space for Multi-Class Active Learning	We propose to approach active learning (AL) from a novel perspective of discovering and then ranking potential support vectors by leveraging the key properties of the dual space of a sparse kernel max-margin predictor. We theoretically analyze the change of a hinge loss in the dual form and provide both the upper and lower bounds that are deeply connected to the key geometric properties induced by the dual space, which then help us identify various types of important data samples for AL. These bounds inform the design of a novel sampling strategy that leverages class-wise evidence as a key vehicle, formed through an affine combination of dual variables and kernel evaluation. We construct two distinct types of sampling functions, including discovery and ranking. The former focuses on samples with low total evidence from all classes, which signifies their potential to support exploration; the latter exploits the current decision boundary to identify the most conflicting regions for sampling, aiming to further refine the decision boundary. These two functions, which are complementary to each other, are automatically arranged into a two-phase active sampling process that starts with the discovery and then transitions to the ranking of data points to most effectively balance exploration and exploitation. Experiments on various real-world data demonstrate the state-of-the-art AL performance achieved by our model.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yu23d	Dayou Yu, Weishi Shi, Qi Yu
Bag of Tricks for Training Data Extraction from Language Models	With the advance of language models, privacy protection is receiving more attention. Training data extraction is therefore of great importance, as it can serve as a potential tool to assess privacy leakage. However, due to the difficulty of this task, most of the existing methods are proof-of-concept and still not effective enough. In this paper, we investigate and benchmark tricks for improving training data extraction using a publicly available dataset. Because most existing extraction methods use a pipeline of generating-then-ranking, i.e., generating text candidates as potential training data and then ranking them based on specific criteria, our research focuses on the tricks for both text generation (e.g., sampling strategy) and text ranking (e.g., token-level criteria). The experimental results show that several previously overlooked tricks can be crucial to the success of training data extraction. Based on the GPT-Neo 1.3B evaluation results, our proposed tricks outperform the baseline by a large margin in most cases, providing a much stronger baseline for future research. The code is available at https://github.com/weichen-yu/LM-Extraction.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yu23c	Weichen Yu, Tianyu Pang, Qian Liu, Chao Du, Bingyi Kang, Yan Huang, Min Lin, Shuicheng Yan
Delving into Noisy Label Detection with Clean Data	A critical element of learning with noisy labels is noisy label detection. Notably, numerous previous works assume that no source of labels can be clean in a noisy label detection context. In this work, we relax this assumption and assume that a small subset of the training data is clean, which enables substantial noisy label detection performance gains. Specifically, we propose a novel framework that leverages clean data by framing the problem of noisy label detection with clean data as a multiple hypothesis testing problem. Moreover, we propose BHN, a simple yet effective approach for noisy label detection that integrates the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure into deep neural networks. BHN achieves $\textit{state-of-the-art}$ performance and outperforms baselines by $\textbf{28.48}$% in terms of false discovery rate (FDR) and by $\textbf{18.99}$% in terms of F1 on CIFAR-10. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the superiority of BHN.

COLA: Orchestrating Error Coding and Learning for Robust Neural Network Inference Against Hardware Defects	Error correcting output codes (ECOCs) have been proposed to improve the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) against hardware defects of DNN hardware accelerators. Unfortunately, existing efforts suffer from drawbacks that would greatly impact their practicality: 1) robust accuracy (with defects) improvement at the cost of degraded clean accuracy (without defects); 2) no guarantee on better robust or clean accuracy using stronger ECOCs. In this paper, we first shed light on the connection between these drawbacks and error correlation, and then propose a novel comprehensive error decorrelation framework, namely COLA. Specifically, we propose to reduce inner layer feature error correlation by 1) adopting a separated architecture, where the last portions of the paths to all output nodes are separated, and 2) orthogonalizing weights in common DNN layers so that the intermediate features are orthogonal with each other. We also propose a regularization technique based on total correlation to mitigate overall error correlation at the outputs. The effectiveness of COLA is first analyzed theoretically, and then evaluated experimentally, e.g. up to 6.7% clean accuracy improvement compared with the original DNNs and up to 40% robust accuracy improvement compared to the state-of-the-art ECOC-enhanced DNNs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yu23a	Anlan Yu, Ning Lyu, Jieming Yin, Zhiyuan Yan, Wujie Wen
The Benefits of Model-Based Generalization in Reinforcement Learning	Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (RL) is widely believed to have the potential to improve sample efficiency by allowing an agent to synthesize large amounts of imagined experience. Experience Replay (ER) can be considered a simple kind of model, which has proved effective at improving the stability and efficiency of deep RL. In principle, a learned parametric model could improve on ER by generalizing from real experience to augment the dataset with additional plausible experience. However, given that learned value functions can also generalize, it is not immediately obvious why model generalization should be better. Here, we provide theoretical and empirical insight into when, and how, we can expect data generated by a learned model to be useful. First, we provide a simple theorem motivating how learning a model as an intermediate step can narrow down the set of possible value functions more than learning a value function directly from data using the Bellman equation. Second, we provide an illustrative example showing empirically how a similar effect occurs in a more concrete setting with neural network function approximation. Finally, we provide extensive experiments showing the benefit of model-based learning for online RL in environments with combinatorial complexity, but factored structure that allows a learned model to generalize. In these experiments, we take care to control for other factors in order to isolate, insofar as possible, the benefit of using experience generated by a learned model relative to ER alone.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/young23a	Kenny John Young, Aditya Ramesh, Louis Kirsch, Jürgen Schmidhuber
Entropy-driven Unsupervised Keypoint Representation Learning in Videos	Extracting informative representations from videos is fundamental for effectively learning various downstream tasks. We present a novel approach for unsupervised learning of meaningful representations from videos, leveraging the concept of image spatial entropy (ISE) that quantifies the per-pixel information in an image. We argue that local entropy of pixel neighborhoods and their temporal evolution create valuable intrinsic supervisory signals for learning prominent features. Building on this idea, we abstract visual features into a concise representation of keypoints that act as dynamic information transmitters, and design a deep learning model that learns, purely unsupervised, spatially and temporally consistent representations directly from video frames. Two original information-theoretic losses, computed from local entropy, guide our model to discover consistent keypoint representations; a loss that maximizes the spatial information covered by the keypoints and a loss that optimizes the keypoints' information transportation over time. We compare our keypoint representation to strong baselines for various downstream tasks, e.g., learning object dynamics. Our empirical results show superior performance for our information-driven keypoints that resolve challenges like attendance to static and dynamic objects or objects abruptly entering and leaving the scene.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/younes23a	Ali Younes, Simone Schaub-Meyer, Georgia Chalvatzaki
Analyzing Convergence in Quantum Neural Networks: Deviations from Neural Tangent Kernels	A quantum neural network (QNN) is a parameterized mapping efficiently implementable on near-term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. It can be used for supervised learning when combined with classical gradient-based optimizers. Despite the existing empirical and theoretical investigations, the convergence of QNN training is not fully understood. Inspired by the success of the neural tangent kernels (NTKs) in probing into the dynamics of classical neural networks, a recent line of works proposes to study over-parameterized QNNs by examining a quantum version of tangent kernels. In this work, we study the dynamics of QNNs and show that contrary to popular belief it is qualitatively different from that of any kernel regression: due to the unitarity of quantum operations, there is a non-negligible deviation from the tangent kernel regression derived at the random initialization. As a result of the deviation, we prove the at-most sublinear convergence for QNNs with Pauli measurements, which is beyond the explanatory power of any kernel regression dynamics. We then present the actual dynamics of QNNs in the limit of over-parameterization. The new dynamics capture the change of convergence rate during training and implies that the range of measurements is crucial to the fast QNN convergence.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/you23a	Xuchen You, Shouvanik Chakrabarti, Boyang Chen, Xiaodi Wu
Graph Generative Model for Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks	As the field of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) continues to grow, it experiences a corresponding increase in the need for large, real-world datasets to train and test new GNN models on challenging, realistic problems. Unfortunately, such graph datasets are often generated from online, highly privacy-restricted ecosystems, which makes research and development on these datasets hard, if not impossible. This greatly reduces the amount of benchmark graphs available to researchers, causing the field to rely only on a handful of publicly-available datasets. To address this problem, we introduce a novel graph generative model, Computation Graph Transformer (CGT) that learns and reproduces the distribution of real-world graphs in a privacy-controlled way. More specifically, CGT (1) generates effective benchmark graphs on which GNNs show similar task performance as on the source graphs, (2) scales to process large-scale graphs, (3) incorporates off-the-shelf privacy modules to guarantee end-user privacy of the generated graph. Extensive experiments across a vast body of graph generative models show that only our model can successfully generate privacy-controlled, synthetic substitutes of large-scale real-world graphs that can be effectively used to benchmark GNN models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yoon23d	Minji Yoon, Yue Wu, John Palowitch, Bryan Perozzi, Russ Salakhutdinov

Continual Learners are Incremental Model Generalizers	Motivated by the efficiency and rapid convergence of pre-trained models for solving downstream tasks, this paper extensively studies the impact of Continual Learning (CL) models as pre-trainers. We find that, in both supervised and unsupervised CL, the transfer quality of representations does not show a noticeable degradation of fine-tuning performance but rather increases gradually. This is because CL models can learn improved task-general features when easily forgetting task-specific knowledge. Based on this observation, we suggest a new unsupervised CL framework with masked modeling, which aims to capture fluent task-generic representation during training. Furthermore, we propose a new fine-tuning scheme, GLobal Attention Discretization (GLAD), that preserves rich task-generic representation during solving downstream tasks. The model fine-tuned with GLAD achieves competitive performance and can also be used as a good pre-trained model itself. We believe this paper breaks the barriers between pre-training and fine-tuning steps and leads to a sustainable learning framework in which the continual learner incrementally improves model generalization, yielding better transfer to unseen tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yoon23b	Jaehong Yoon, Sung Ju Hwang, Yue Cao
EM-Network: Oracle Guided Self-distillation for Sequence Learning	We introduce EM-Network, a novel self-distillation approach that effectively leverages target information for supervised sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) learning. In contrast to conventional methods, it is trained with oracle guidance, which is derived from the target sequence. Since the oracle guidance compactly represents the target-side context that can assist the sequence model in solving the task, the EM-Network achieves a better prediction compared to using only the source input. To allow the sequence model to inherit the promising capability of the EM-Network, we propose a new self-distillation strategy, where the original sequence model can benefit from the knowledge of the EM-Network in a one-stage manner. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two types of seq2seq models: connectionist temporal classification (CTC) for speech recognition and attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) for machine translation. Experimental results demonstrate that the EM-Network significantly advances the current state-of-the-art approaches, improving over the best prior work on speech recognition and establishing state-of-the-art performance on WMT'14 and IWSLT'14.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yoon23a	Ji Won Yoon, Sunghwan Ahn, Hyeonseung Lee, Minchan Kim, Seok Min Kim, Nam Soo Kim
End-to-End Multi-Object Detection with a Regularized Mixture Model	Recent end-to-end multi-object detectors simplify the inference pipeline by removing hand-crafted processes such as non-maximum suppression (NMS). However, during training, they still heavily rely on heuristics and hand-crafted processes which deteriorate the reliability of the predicted confidence score. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to train an end-to-end multi-object detector consisting of only two terms: negative log-likelihood (NLL) and a regularization term. In doing so, the multi-object detection problem is treated as density estimation of the ground truth bounding boxes utilizing a regularized mixture density model. The proposed end-to-end multi-object Detection with a Regularized Mixture Model (D-RMM) is trained by minimizing the NLL with the proposed regularization term, maximum component maximization (MCM) loss, preventing duplicate predictions. Our method reduces the heuristics of the training process and improves the reliability of the predicted confidence score. Moreover, our D-RMM outperforms the previous end-to-end detectors on MS COCO dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/lhj815/D-RMM.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yoo23b	Jaeyoung Yoo, Hojun Lee, Seunghyeon Seo, Inseop Chung, Nojun Kwak
Improving Visual Prompt Tuning for Self-supervised Vision Transformers	Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is an effective tuning method for adapting pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) to downstream tasks. It leverages extra learnable tokens, known as prompts, which steer the frozen pretrained ViTs. Although VPT has demonstrated its applicability with supervised vision transformers, it often underperforms with self-supervised ones. Through empirical observations, we deduce that the effectiveness of VPT hinges largely on the ViT blocks with which the prompt tokens interact. Specifically, VPT shows improved performance on image classification tasks for MAE and MoCo v3 when the prompt tokens are inserted into later blocks rather than the first block. These observations suggest that there exists an optimal location of blocks for the insertion of prompt tokens. Unfortunately, identifying the optimal blocks for prompts within each self-supervised ViT for diverse future scenarios is a costly process. To mitigate this problem, we propose a simple yet effective method that learns a gate for each ViT block to adjust its intervention into the prompt tokens. With our method, prompt tokens are selectively influenced by blocks that require steering for task adaptation. Our method outperforms VPT variants in FGVC and VTAB image classification and ADE20K semantic segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/ryongithub/GatedPromptTuning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yoo23a	Seungryong Yoo, Eunji Kim, Dahuin Jung, Jungbeom Lee, Sungroh Yoon
Adaptive Estimation of Graphical Models under Total Positivity	We consider the problem of estimating (diagonally dominant) M-matrices as precision matrices in Gaussian graphical models. Such models have shown interesting properties, e.g., the maximum likelihood estimator exists with as little as two observations in the case of M-matrices, and exists even with one observation in the case of diagonally dominant M-matrices. We propose an adaptive multiple-stage estimation method, which refines the estimate by solving a weighted $\ell_1$-regularized problem in each stage. We further design a unified framework based on gradient projection method to solve the regularized problem, equipped with different projections to handle the constraints of M-matrices and diagonally dominant M-matrices. Theoretical analysis of the estimation error is established. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating precision matrices and identifying graph edges, as evidenced by synthetic and financial time-series data sets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ying23a	Jiaxi Ying, José Vinı́cius De Miranda Cardoso, Daniel P.

CoCo: A Coupled Contrastive Framework for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Graph Classification	Although graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive achievements in graph classification, they often need abundant task-specific labels, which could be extensively costly to acquire. A credible solution is to explore additional labeled graphs to enhance unsupervised learning on the target domain. However, how to apply GNNs to domain adaptation remains unsolved owing to the insufficient exploration of graph topology and the significant domain discrepancy. In this paper, we propose Coupled Contrastive Graph Representation Learning (CoCo), which extracts the topological information from coupled learning branches and reduces the domain discrepancy with coupled contrastive learning. CoCo contains a graph convolutional network branch and a hierarchical graph kernel network branch, which explore graph topology in implicit and explicit manners. Besides, we incorporate coupled branches into a holistic multi-view contrastive learning framework, which not only incorporates graph representations learned from complementary views for enhanced understanding, but also encourages the similarity between cross-domain example pairs with the same semantics for domain alignment. Extensive experiments on popular datasets show that our CoCo outperforms these competing baselines in different settings generally.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yin23a	Nan Yin, Li Shen, Mengzhu Wang, Long Lan, Zeyu Ma, Chong Chen, Xian-Sheng Hua, Xiao Luo
SE(3) diffusion model with application to protein backbone generation	The design of novel protein structures remains a challenge in protein engineering for applications across biomedicine and chemistry. In this line of work, a diffusion model over rigid bodies in 3D (referred to as frames) has shown success in generating novel, functional protein backbones that have not been observed in nature. However, there exists no principled methodological framework for diffusion on SE(3), the space of orientation preserving rigid motions in R3, that operates on frames and confers the group invariance. We address these shortcomings by developing theoretical foundations of SE(3) invariant diffusion models on multiple frames followed by a novel framework, FrameDiff, for estimating the SE(3) equivariant score over multiple frames. We apply FrameDiff on monomer backbone generation and find it can generate designable monomers up to 500 amino acids without relying on a pretrained protein structure prediction network that has been integral to previous methods. We find our samples are capable of generalizing beyond any known protein structure.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yim23a	Jason Yim, Brian L.

MonoFlow: Rethinking Divergence GANs via the Perspective of Wasserstein Gradient Flows	The conventional understanding of adversarial training in generative adversarial networks (GANs) is that the discriminator is trained to estimate a divergence, and the generator learns to minimize this divergence. We argue that despite the fact that many variants of GANs were developed following this paradigm, the current theoretical understanding of GANs and their practical algorithms are inconsistent. In this paper, we leverage Wasserstein gradient flows which characterize the evolution of particles in the sample space, to gain theoretical insights and algorithmic inspiration of GANs. We introduce a unified generative modeling framework – MonoFlow: the particle evolution is rescaled via a monotonically increasing mapping of the log density ratio. Under our framework, adversarial training can be viewed as a procedure first obtaining MonoFlow's vector field via training the discriminator and the generator learns to draw the particle flow defined by the corresponding vector field. We also reveal the fundamental difference between variational divergence minimization and adversarial training. This analysis helps us to identify what types of generator loss functions can lead to the successful training of GANs and suggest that GANs may have more loss designs beyond the literature (e.g., non-saturated loss), as long as they realize MonoFlow. Consistent empirical studies are included to validate the effectiveness of our framework.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yi23c	Mingxuan Yi, Zhanxing Zhu, Song Liu
Online Prototype Alignment for Few-shot Policy Transfer	Domain adaptation in RL mainly deals with the changes of observation when transferring the policy to a new environment. Many traditional approaches of domain adaptation in RL manage to learn a mapping function between the source and target domain in explicit or implicit ways. However, they typically require access to abundant data from the target domain. Besides, they often rely on visual clues to learn the mapping function and may fail when the source domain looks quite different from the target domain. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel framework Online Prototype Alignment (OPA) to learn the mapping function based on the functional similarity of elements and is able to achieve few-shot policy transfer within only several episodes. The key insight of OPA is to introduce an exploration mechanism that can interact with the unseen elements of the target domain in an efficient and purposeful manner, and then connect them with the seen elements in the source domain according to their functionalities (instead of visual clues). Experimental results show that when the target domain looks visually different from the source domain, OPA can achieve better transfer performance even with much fewer samples from the target domain, outperforming prior methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yi23b	Qi Yi, Rui Zhang, Shaohui Peng, Jiaming Guo, Yunkai Gao, Kaizhao Yuan, Ruizhi Chen, Siming Lan, Xing Hu, Zidong Du, Xishan Zhang, Qi Guo, Yunji Chen
Doubly Adversarial Federated Bandits	We study a new non-stochastic federated multiarmed bandit problem with multiple agents collaborating via a communication network. The losses of the arms are assigned by an oblivious adversary that specifies the loss of each arm not only for each time step but also for each agent, which we call doubly adversarial. In this setting, different agents may choose the same arm in the same time step but observe different feedback. The goal of each agent is to find a globally best arm in hindsight that has the lowest cumulative loss averaged over all agents, which necessities the communication among agents. We provide regret lower bounds for any federated bandit algorithm under different settings, when agents have access to full-information feedback, or the bandit feedback. For the bandit feedback setting, we propose a near-optimal federated bandit algorithm called FEDEXP3. Our algorithm gives a positive answer to an open question proposed in (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2016): FEDEXP3 can guarantee a sub-linear regret without exchanging sequences of selected arm identities or loss sequences among agents. We also provide numerical evaluations of our algorithm to validate our theoretical results and demonstrate its effectiveness on synthetic and real-world datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yi23a	Jialin Yi, Milan Vojnovic
From Temporal to Contemporaneous Iterative Causal Discovery in the Presence of Latent Confounders	We present a constraint-based algorithm for learning causal structures from observational time-series data, in the presence of latent confounders. We assume a discrete-time, stationary structural vector autoregressive process, with both temporal and contemporaneous causal relations. One may ask if temporal and contemporaneous relations should be treated differently. The presented algorithm gradually refines a causal graph by learning long-term temporal relations before short-term ones, where contemporaneous relations are learned last. This ordering of causal relations to be learnt leads to a reduction in the required number of statistical tests. We validate this reduction empirically and demonstrate that it leads to higher accuracy for synthetic data and more plausible causal graphs for real-world data compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yehezkel-rohekar23a	Raanan Yehezkel Rohekar, Shami Nisimov, Yaniv Gurwicz, Gal Novik
Temporal Label Smoothing for Early Event Prediction	Models that can predict the occurrence of events ahead of time with low false-alarm rates are critical to the acceptance of decision support systems in the medical community. This challenging task is typically treated as a simple binary classification, ignoring temporal dependencies between samples, whereas we propose to exploit this structure. We first introduce a common theoretical framework unifying dynamic survival analysis and early event prediction. Following an analysis of objectives from both fields, we propose Temporal Label Smoothing (TLS), a simpler, yet best-performing method that preserves prediction monotonicity over time. By focusing the objective on areas with a stronger predictive signal, TLS improves performance over all baselines on two large-scale benchmark tasks. Gains are particularly notable along clinically relevant measures, such as event recall at low false-alarm rates. TLS reduces the number of missed events by up to a factor of two over previously used approaches in early event prediction.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yeche23a	Hugo Yèche, Alizée Pace, Gunnar Ratsch, Rita Kuznetsova
Towards Quantum Machine Learning for Constrained Combinatorial Optimization: a Quantum QAP Solver	Combinatorial optimization (CO) on the graph is a crucial but challenging research topic. Recent quantum algorithms provide a new perspective for solving CO problems and have the potential to demonstrate quantum advantage. Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a well-known quantum heuristic for CO constructed by a parametric quantum circuit. However, QAOA is originally designed for unconstrained problems and the circuit parameters and solutions are jointly solved with time-consuming iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel quantum neural network (QNN) for learning CO problems in a supervised manner to achieve better and faster results. We focus on the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) with matching constraints and the node permutation invariance property. To this end, a quantum neural network called QAP-QNN is devised to translate the QAP into a constrained vertex classification task. Moreover, we study two QAP tasks: Graph Matching and Traveling Salesman Problem on TorchQauntum simulators, and empirically show the effectiveness of our approach.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ye23g	Xinyu Ye, Ge Yan, Junchi Yan
FedDisco: Federated Learning with Discrepancy-Aware Collaboration	This work considers the category distribution heterogeneity in federated learning. This issue is due to biased labeling preferences at multiple clients and is a typical setting of data heterogeneity. To alleviate this issue, most previous works consider either regularizing local models or fine-tuning the global model, while they ignore the adjustment of aggregation weights and simply assign weights based on the dataset size. However, based on our empirical observations and theoretical analysis, we find that the dataset size is not optimal and the discrepancy between local and global category distributions could be a beneficial and complementary indicator for determining aggregation weights. We thus propose a novel aggregation method, Federated Learning with Discrepancy-Aware Collaboration (FedDisco), whose aggregation weights not only involve both the dataset size and the discrepancy value, but also contribute to a tighter theoretical upper bound of the optimization error. FedDisco can promote utility and modularity in a communication- and computation-efficient way. Extensive experiments show that our FedDisco outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and can be easily incorporated with many existing methods to further enhance the performance. Our code will be available at https://github.com/MediaBrain-SJTU/FedDisco.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ye23f	Rui Ye, Mingkai Xu, Jianyu Wang, Chenxin Xu, Siheng Chen, Yanfeng Wang
GNN&GBDT-Guided Fast Optimizing Framework for Large-scale Integer Programming	The latest two-stage optimization framework based on graph neural network (GNN) and large neighborhood search (LNS) is the most popular framework in solving large-scale integer programs (IPs). However, the framework can not effectively use the embedding spatial information in GNN and still highly relies on large-scale solvers in LNS, resulting in the scale of IP being limited by the ability of the current solver and performance bottlenecks. To handle these issues, this paper presents a GNN&GBDT-guided fast optimizing framework for large-scale IPs that only uses a small-scale optimizer to solve large-scale IPs efficiently. Specifically, the proposed framework can be divided into three stages: Multi-task GNN Embedding to generate the embedding space, GBDT Prediction to effectively use the embedding spatial information, and Neighborhood Optimization to solve large-scale problems fast using the small-scale optimizer. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework can solve IPs with millions of scales and surpass SCIP and Gurobi in the specified wall-clock time using only a small-scale optimizer with 30% of the problem size. It also shows that the proposed framework can save 99% of running time in achieving the same solution quality as SCIP, which verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework in solving large-scale IPs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ye23e	Huigen Ye, Hua Xu, Hongyan Wang, Chengming Wang, Yu Jiang
Corruption-Robust Algorithms with Uncertainty Weighting for Nonlinear Contextual Bandits and Markov Decision Processes	Despite the significant interest and progress in reinforcement learning (RL) problems with adversarial corruption, current works are either confined to the linear setting or lead to an undesired $\tilde{\mathcal O}(\sqrt{T}\zeta)$ regret bound, where $T$ is the number of rounds and $\zeta$ is the total amount of corruption. In this paper, we consider contextual bandits with general function approximation and propose a computationally efficient algorithm to achieve a regret of $\tilde{\mathcal O}(\sqrt{T}+\zeta)$. The proposed algorithm relies on the recently developed uncertainty-weighted least-squares regression from linear contextual bandits (He et al., 2022) and a new weighted estimator of uncertainty for the general function class. In contrast to the existing analysis for the sum of uncertainty that is heavily based on the linear structure, we develop a novel technique to control the sum of weighted uncertainty, thus establishing the final regret bound. We then generalize our algorithm to the episodic MDP and first achieve an additive dependence on the corruption level $\zeta$ in the scenario of general function approximation. Notably, our algorithms achieve regret bounds that either nearly match the lower bound or improve the performance of existing methods for all the corruption levels in both known and unknown $\zeta$ cases.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ye23d	Chenlu Ye, Wei Xiong, Quanquan Gu, Tong Zhang
Compositional Exemplars for In-context Learning	Large pretrained language models (LMs) have shown impressive In-Context Learning (ICL) ability, where the model learns to do an unseen task simply by conditioning on a prompt consisting of input-output examples as demonstration, without any parameter updates. The performance of ICL is highly dominated by the quality of the selected in-context examples. However, previous selection methods are mostly based on simple heuristics, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this work, we systematically formulate in-context example selection as a subset selection problem, and optimize it in an end-to-end fashion. We propose CEIL (Compositional Exemplars for In-context Learning), which is instantiated by Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) to model the interaction between the given input and in-context examples, and optimized through carefully-designed contrastive learning to obtain preference from LMs. We validate CEIL on 12 classification and generation datasets from 7 distinct NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, phraphrase detection, natural language inference, commonsense reasoning, open-domain question answering, code generation and semantic parsing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, compositionality of CEIL, shedding new lights on in-context leaning.

Personalized Federated Learning with Inferred Collaboration Graphs	Personalized federated learning (FL) aims to collaboratively train a personalized model for each client. Previous methods do not adaptively determine who to collaborate at a fine-grained level, making them difficult to handle diverse data heterogeneity levels and those cases where malicious clients exist. To address this issue, our core idea is to learn a collaboration graph, which models the benefits from each pairwise collaboration and allocates appropriate collaboration strengths. Based on this, we propose a novel personalized FL algorithm, pFedGraph, which consists of two key modules: (1) inferring the collaboration graph based on pairwise model similarity and dataset size at server to promote fine-grained collaboration and (2) optimizing local model with the assistance of aggregated model at client to promote personalization. The advantage of pFedGraph is flexibly adaptive to diverse data heterogeneity levels and model poisoning attacks, as the proposed collaboration graph always pushes each client to collaborate more with similar and beneficial clients. Extensive experiments show that pFedGraph consistently outperforms the other $14$ baseline methods across various heterogeneity levels and multiple cases where malicious clients exist. Code will be available at https://github.com/MediaBrain-SJTU/pFedGraph.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ye23b	Rui Ye, Zhenyang Ni, Fangzhao Wu, Siheng Chen, Yanfeng Wang
On the Power of Pre-training for Generalization in RL: Provable Benefits and Hardness	Generalization in Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to train an agent during training that generalizes to the target environment. In this work, we first point out that RL generalization is fundamentally different from the generalization in supervised learning, and fine-tuning on the target environment is necessary for good test performance. Therefore, we seek to answer the following question: how much can we expect pre-training over training environments to be helpful for efficient and effective fine-tuning? On one hand, we give a surprising result showing that asymptotically, the improvement from pre-training is at most a constant factor. On the other hand, we show that pre-training can be indeed helpful in the non-asymptotic regime by designing a policy collection-elimination (PCE) algorithm and proving a distribution-dependent regret bound that is independent of the state-action space. We hope our theoretical results can provide insight towards understanding pre-training and generalization in RL.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ye23a	Haotian Ye, Xiaoyu Chen, Liwei Wang, Simon Shaolei Du
Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Language Modeling	Recent multimodal models such as DALL-E and CM3 have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-image and image-to-text generation. However, these models store all their knowledge (e.g., the appearance of the Eiffel Tower) in the model parameters, requiring increasingly larger models and training data to capture more knowledge. To integrate knowledge in a more scalable and modular way, we propose a retrieval-augmented multimodal model, which enables a base multimodal model (generator) to refer to relevant text and images fetched by a retriever from external memory (e.g., documents on the web). Specifically, for the retriever, we use a pretrained CLIP, and for the generator, we train a CM3 Transformer on the LAION dataset. Our resulting model, named Retrieval-Augmented CM3 (RA-CM3), is the first multimodal model that can retrieve and generate both text and images. We show that RA-CM3 significantly outperforms baseline multimodal models such as DALL-E and CM3 on both image and caption generation tasks (12 FID and 17 CIDEr improvements on MS-COCO), while requiring much less compute for training ($<$30% of DALL-E). Moreover, we show that RA-CM3 exhibits novel capabilities such as faithful image generation and multimodal in-context learning (e.g., image generation from demonstrations).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yasunaga23a	Michihiro Yasunaga, Armen Aghajanyan, Weijia Shi, Richard James, Jure Leskovec, Percy Liang, Mike Lewis, Luke Zettlemoyer, Wen-Tau Yih
Policy Mirror Ascent for Efficient and Independent Learning in Mean Field Games	"Mean-field games have been used as a theoretical tool to obtain an approximate Nash equilibrium for symmetric and anonymous $N$-player games. However, limiting applicability, existing theoretical results assume variations of a ""population generative model"", which allows arbitrary modifications of the population distribution by the learning algorithm. Moreover, learning algorithms typically work on abstract simulators with population instead of the $N$-player game. Instead, we show that $N$ agents running policy mirror ascent converge to the Nash equilibrium of the regularized game within $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples from a single sample trajectory without a population generative model, up to a standard $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$ error due to the mean field. Taking a divergent approach from the literature, instead of working with the best-response map we first show that a policy mirror ascent map can be used to construct a contractive operator having the Nash equilibrium as its fixed point. We analyze single-path TD learning for $N$-agent games, proving sample complexity guarantees by only using a sample path from the $N$-agent simulator without a population generative model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methodology allows for independent learning by $N$ agents with finite sample guarantees."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yardim23a	Batuhan Yardim, Semih Cayci, Matthieu Geist, Niao He
MultiAdam: Parameter-wise Scale-invariant Optimizer for Multiscale Training of Physics-informed Neural Networks	Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in various fields by minimizing a weighted sum of PDE loss and boundary loss. However, there are several critical challenges in the training of PINNs, including the lack of theoretical frameworks and the imbalance between PDE loss and boundary loss. In this paper, we present an analysis of second-order non-homogeneous PDEs, which are classified into three categories and applicable to various common problems. We also characterize the connections between the training loss and actual error, guaranteeing convergence under mild conditions. The theoretical analysis inspires us to further propose MultiAdam, a scale-invariant optimizer that leverages gradient momentum to parameter-wisely balance the loss terms. Extensive experiment results on multiple problems from different physical domains demonstrate that our MultiAdam solver can improve the predictive accuracy by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared with strong baselines.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yao23c	Jiachen Yao, Chang Su, Zhongkai Hao, Songming Liu, Hang Su, Jun Zhu
How Bad is Top-$K$ Recommendation under Competing Content Creators?	This study explores the impact of content creators' competition on user welfare in recommendation platforms, as well as the long-term dynamics of relevance-driven recommendations. We establish a model of creator competition, under the setting where the platform uses a top-$K$ recommendation policy, user decisions are guided by the Random Utility model, and creators, in absence of explicit utility functions, employ arbitrary no-regret learning algorithms for strategy updates. We study the user welfare guarantee through the lens of Price of Anarchy and show that the fraction of user welfare loss due to creator competition is always upper bounded by a small constant depending on $K$ and randomness in user decisions; we also prove the tightness of this bound. Our result discloses an intrinsic merit of the relevance-driven recommendation policy, as long as users' decisions involve randomness and the platform provides reasonably many alternatives to its users.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yao23b	Fan Yao, Chuanhao Li, Denis Nekipelov, Hongning Wang, Haifeng Xu

Hyperbolic Representation Learning: Revisiting and Advancing	The non-Euclidean geometry of hyperbolic spaces has recently garnered considerable attention in the realm of representation learning. Current endeavors in hyperbolic representation largely presuppose that the underlying hierarchies can be automatically inferred and preserved through the adaptive optimization process. This assumption, however, is questionable and requires further validation. In this work, we first introduce a position-tracking mechanism to scrutinize existing prevalent hyperbolic models, revealing that the learned representations are sub-optimal and unsatisfactory. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, hyperbolic informed embedding (HIE), by incorporating cost-free hierarchical information deduced from the hyperbolic distance of the node to the origin (i.e., induced hyperbolic norm) to advance existing hyperbolic models. The proposed method HIE is both task-agnostic and model-agnostic, enabling its seamless integration with a broad spectrum of models and tasks. Extensive experiments across various models and different tasks demonstrate the versatility and adaptability of the proposed method. Remarkably, our method achieves a remarkable improvement of up to 21.4% compared to the competing baselines.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yang23u	Menglin Yang, Min Zhou, Rex Ying, Yankai Chen, Irwin King
Continual Task Allocation in Meta-Policy Network via Sparse Prompting	"How to train a generalizable meta-policy by continually learning a sequence of tasks? It is a natural human skill yet challenging to achieve by current reinforcement learning: the agent is expected to quickly adapt to new tasks (plasticity) meanwhile retaining the common knowledge from previous tasks (stability). We address it by ""Continual Task Allocation via Sparse Prompting (CoTASP)"", which learns over-complete dictionaries to produce sparse masks as prompts extracting a sub-network for each task from a meta-policy network. CoTASP trains a policy for each task by optimizing the prompts and the sub-network weights alternatively. The dictionary is then updated to align the optimized prompts with tasks' embedding, thereby capturing tasks' semantic correlations. Hence, relevant tasks share more neurons in the meta-policy network due to similar prompts while cross-task interference causing forgetting is effectively restrained. Given a meta-policy and dictionaries trained on previous tasks, new task adaptation reduces to highly efficient sparse prompting and sub-network finetuning. In experiments, CoTASP achieves a promising plasticity-stability trade-off without storing or replaying any past tasks' experiences. It outperforms existing continual and multi-task RL methods on all seen tasks, forgetting reduction, and generalization to unseen tasks."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yang23t	Yijun Yang, Tianyi Zhou, Jing Jiang, Guodong Long, Yuhui Shi
Change is Hard: A Closer Look at Subpopulation Shift	Machine learning models often perform poorly on subgroups that are underrepresented in the training data. Yet, little is understood on the variation in mechanisms that cause subpopulation shifts, and how algorithms generalize across such diverse shifts at scale. In this work, we provide a fine-grained analysis of subpopulation shift. We first propose a unified framework that dissects and explains common shifts in subgroups. We then establish a comprehensive benchmark of 20 state-of-the-art algorithms evaluated on 12 real-world datasets in vision, language, and healthcare domains. With results obtained from training over 10,000 models, we reveal intriguing observations for future progress in this space. First, existing algorithms only improve subgroup robustness over certain types of shifts but not others. Moreover, while current algorithms rely on group-annotated validation data for model selection, we find that a simple selection criterion based on worst-class accuracy is surprisingly effective even without any group information. Finally, unlike existing works that solely aim to improve worst-group accuracy (WGA), we demonstrate the fundamental tradeoff between WGA and other important metrics, highlighting the need to carefully choose testing metrics.

Neural Prediction Errors enable Analogical Visual Reasoning in Human Standard Intelligence Tests	Deep neural networks have long been criticized for lacking the ability to perform analogical visual reasoning. Here, we propose a neural network model to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) - one of the standard intelligence tests in human psychology. Specifically, we design a reasoning block based on the well-known concept of prediction error (PE) in neuroscience. Our reasoning block uses convolution to extract abstract rules from high-level visual features of the 8 context images and generates the features of a predicted answer. PEs are then calculated between the predicted features and those of the 8 candidate answers, and are then passed to the next stage. We further integrate our novel reasoning blocks into a residual network and build a new Predictive Reasoning Network (PredRNet). Extensive experiments show that our proposed PredRNet achieves state-of-the-art average performance on several important RPM benchmarks. PredRNet also shows good generalization abilities in a variety of out-of-distribution scenarios and other visual reasoning tasks. Most importantly, our PredRNet forms low-dimensional representations of abstract rules and minimizes hierarchical prediction errors during model training, supporting the critical role of PE minimization in visual reasoning. Our work highlights the potential of using neuroscience theories to solve abstract visual reasoning problems in artificial intelligence. The code is available at https://github.com/ZjjConan/AVR-PredRNet.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yang23r	Lingxiao Yang, Hongzhi You, Zonglei Zhen, Dahui Wang, Xiaohong Wan, Xiaohua Xie, Ru-Yuan Zhang
What is Essential for Unseen Goal Generalization of Offline Goal-conditioned RL?	Offline goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) offers a way to train general-purpose agents from fully offline datasets. In addition to being conservative within the dataset, the generalization ability to achieve unseen goals is another fundamental challenge for offline GCRL. However, to the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been well studied yet. In this paper, we study out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of offline GCRL both theoretically and empirically to identify factors that are important. In a number of experiments, we observe that weighted imitation learning enjoys better generalization than pessimism-based offline RL method. Based on this insight, we derive a theory for OOD generalization, which characterizes several important design choices. We then propose a new offline GCRL method, Generalizable Offline goAl-condiTioned RL (GOAT), by combining the findings from our theoretical and empirical studies. On a new benchmark containing 9 independent identically distributed (IID) tasks and 17 OOD tasks, GOAT outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yang23q	Rui Yang, Lin Yong, Xiaoteng Ma, Hao Hu, Chongjie Zhang, Tong Zhang
Towards Controlled Data Augmentations for Active Learning	The mission of active learning is to identify the most valuable data samples, thus attaining decent performance with much fewer samples. The data augmentation techniques seem straightforward yet promising to enhance active learning by extending the exploration of the input space, which helps locate more valuable samples. In this work, we thoroughly study the coupling of data augmentation and active learning, thereby proposing Controllable Augmentation ManiPulator for Active Learning. In contrast to the few prior works that touched on this line, CAMPAL emphasizes a purposeful, tighten, and better-controlled integration of data augmentation into active learning in three folds: (i)-carefully designed augmentation policies applied separately on labeled and unlabeled data pools; (ii)-controlled and quantifiably optimizable augmentation strengths; (iii)-full and flexible coverage for most (if not all) active learning schemes. Theories are proposed and associated with the development of key components in CAMPAL. Through extensive empirical experiments, we bring the performance of active learning methods to a new level: an absolute performance boost of 16.99% on CIFAR-10 and 12.25 on SVHN with 1,000 annotated samples.

Boosting Offline Reinforcement Learning with Action Preference Query	Training practical agents usually involve offline and online reinforcement learning (RL) to balance the policy's performance and interaction costs. In particular, online fine-tuning has become a commonly used method to correct the erroneous estimates of out-of-distribution data learned in the offline training phase. However, even limited online interactions can be inaccessible or catastrophic for high-stake scenarios like healthcare and autonomous driving. In this work, we introduce an interaction-free training scheme dubbed Offline-with-Action-Preferences (OAP). The main insight is that, compared to online fine-tuning, querying the preferences between pre-collected and learned actions can be equally or even more helpful to the erroneous estimate problem. By adaptively encouraging or suppressing policy constraint according to action preferences, OAP could distinguish overestimation from beneficial policy improvement and thus attains a more accurate evaluation of unseen data. Theoretically, we prove a lower bound of the behavior policy's performance improvement brought by OAP. Moreover, comprehensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark and state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate that OAP yields higher (29% on average) scores, especially on challenging AntMaze tasks (98% higher).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yang23o	Qisen Yang, Shenzhi Wang, Matthieu Gaetan Lin, Shiji Song, Gao Huang

Are Neurons Actually Collapsed? On the Fine-Grained Structure in Neural Representations	"Recent work has observed an intriguing ""Neural Collapse"" phenomenon in well-trained neural networks, where the last-layer representations of training samples with the same label collapse into each other. This appears to suggest that the last-layer representations are completely determined by the labels, and do not depend on the intrinsic structure of input distribution. We provide evidence that this is not a complete description, and that the apparent collapse hides important fine-grained structure in the representations. Specifically, even when representations apparently collapse, the small amount of remaining variation can still faithfully and accurately captures the intrinsic structure of input distribution. As an example, if we train on CIFAR-10 using only 5 coarse-grained labels (by combining two classes into one super-class) until convergence, we can reconstruct the original 10-class labels from the learned representations via unsupervised clustering. The reconstructed labels achieve 93% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 test set, nearly matching the normal CIFAR-10 accuracy for the same architecture. We also provide an initial theoretical result showing the fine-grained representation structure in a simplified synthetic setting. Our results show concretely how the structure of input data can play a significant role in determining the fine-grained structure of neural representations, going beyond what Neural Collapse predicts."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yang23m	Yongyi Yang, Jacob Steinhardt, Wei Hu
Efficient Algorithms for Exact Graph Matching on Correlated Stochastic Block Models with Constant Correlation	We consider the problem of graph matching, or learning vertex correspondence, between two correlated stochastic block models (SBMs). The graph matching problem arises in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing and bioinformatics, and in particular, matching graphs with inherent community structure has significance related to de-anonymization of correlated social networks. Compared to the correlated Erdos-Renyi (ER) model, where various efficient algorithms have been developed, among which a few algorithms have been proven to achieve the exact matching with constant edge correlation, no low-order polynomial algorithm has been known to achieve exact matching for the correlated SBMs with constant correlation. In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm for matching graphs with community structure, based on the comparison between partition trees rooted from each vertex, by extending the idea of Mao et al. (2021) to graphs with communities. The partition tree divides the large neighborhoods of each vertex into disjoint subsets using their edge statistics to different communities. Our algorithm is the first low-order polynomial-time algorithm achieving exact matching between two correlated SBMs with high probability in dense graphs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yang23l	Joonhyuk Yang, Dongpil Shin, Hye Won Chung
A theory of representation learning gives a deep generalisation of kernel methods	The successes of modern deep machine learning methods are founded on their ability to transform inputs across multiple layers to build good high-level representations. It is therefore critical to understand this process of representation learning. However, standard theoretical approaches (formally NNGPs) involving infinite width limits eliminate representation learning. We therefore develop a new infinite width limit, the Bayesian representation learning limit, that exhibits representation learning mirroring that in finite-width models, yet at the same time, retains some of the simplicity of standard infinite-width limits. In particular, we show that Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) in the Bayesian representation learning limit have exactly multivariate Gaussian posteriors, and the posterior covariances can be obtained by optimizing an interpretable objective combining a log-likelihood to improve performance with a series of KL-divergences which keep the posteriors close to the prior. We confirm these results experimentally in wide but finite DGPs. Next, we introduce the possibility of using this limit and objective as a flexible, deep generalisation of kernel methods, that we call deep kernel machines (DKMs). Like most naive kernel methods, DKMs scale cubically in the number of datapoints. We therefore use methods from the Gaussian process inducing point literature to develop a sparse DKM that scales linearly in the number of datapoints. Finally, we extend these approaches to NNs (which have non-Gaussian posteriors) in the Appendices.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yang23k	Adam X.

Mitigating Spurious Correlations in Multi-modal Models during Fine-tuning	Spurious correlations that degrade model generalization or lead the model to be right for the wrong reasons are one of the main robustness concerns for real-world deployments. However, mitigating these correlations during pre-training for large-scale models can be costly and impractical, particularly for those without access to high-performance computing resources. This paper proposes a novel approach to address spurious correlations during fine-tuning for a given domain of interest. With a focus on multi-modal models (e.g., CLIP), the proposed method leverages different modalities in these models to detect and explicitly set apart spurious attributes from the affected class, achieved through a multi-modal contrastive loss function that expresses spurious relationships through language. Our experimental results and in-depth visualizations on CLIP show that such an intervention can effectively i) improve the model's accuracy when spurious attributes are not present, and ii) directs the model's activation maps towards the actual class rather than the spurious attribute when present. In particular, on the Waterbirds dataset, our algorithm achieved a worst-group accuracy 23% higher than ERM on CLIP with a ResNet-50 backbone, and 32% higher on CLIP with a ViT backbone, while maintaining the same average accuracy as ERM.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yang23j	Yu Yang, Besmira Nushi, Hamid Palangi, Baharan Mirzasoleiman
Improving Adversarial Robustness of Deep Equilibrium Models with Explicit Regulations Along the Neural Dynamics	Deep equilibrium (DEQ) models replace the multiple-layer stacking of conventional deep networks with a fixed-point iteration of a single-layer transformation. Having been demonstrated to be competitive in a variety of real-world scenarios, the adversarial robustness of general DEQs becomes increasingly crucial for their reliable deployment. Existing works improve the robustness of general DEQ models with the widely-used adversarial training (AT) framework, but they fail to exploit the structural uniquenesses of DEQ models. To this end, we interpret DEQs through the lens of neural dynamics and find that AT under-regulates intermediate states. Besides, the intermediate states typically provide predictions with a high prediction entropy. Informed by the correlation between the entropy of dynamical systems and their stability properties, we propose reducing prediction entropy by progressively updating inputs along the neural dynamics. During AT, we also utilize random intermediate states to compute the loss function. Our methods regulate the neural dynamics of DEQ models in this manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods substantially increase the robustness of DEQ models and even outperform the strong deep network baselines.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yang23i	Zonghan Yang, Peng Li, Tianyu Pang, Yang Liu
Improving Adversarial Robustness by Putting More Regularizations on Less Robust Samples	Adversarial training, which is to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks, has received much attention because it is easy to generate human-imperceptible perturbations of data to deceive a given deep neural network. In this paper, we propose a new adversarial training algorithm that is theoretically well motivated and empirically superior to other existing algorithms. A novel feature of the proposed algorithm is to apply more regularization to data vulnerable to adversarial attacks than other existing regularization algorithms do. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm can be understood as an algorithm of minimizing a newly derived upper bound of the robust risk. Numerical experiments illustrate that our proposed algorithm improves the generalization (accuracy on examples) and robustness (accuracy on adversarial attacks) simultaneously to achieve the state-of-the-art performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yang23h	Dongyoon Yang, Insung Kong, Yongdai Kim
Towards Sustainable Learning: Coresets for Data-efficient Deep Learning	To improve the efficiency and sustainability of learning deep models, we propose CREST, the first scalable framework with rigorous theoretical guarantees to identify the most valuable examples for training non-convex models, particularly deep networks. To guarantee convergence to a stationary point of a non-convex function, CREST models the non-convex loss as a series of quadratic functions and extracts a coreset for each quadratic sub-region. In addition, to ensure faster convergence of stochastic gradient methods such as (mini-batch) SGD, CREST iteratively extracts multiple mini-batch coresets from larger random subsets of training data, to ensure nearly-unbiased gradients with small variances. Finally, to further improve scalability and efficiency, CREST identifies and excludes the examples that are learned from the coreset selection pipeline. Our extensive experiments on several deep networks trained on vision and NLP datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and SNLI, confirm that CREST speeds up training deep networks on very large datasets, by 1.7x to 2.5x with minimum loss in the performance. By analyzing the learning difficulty of the subsets selected by CREST, we show that deep models benefit the most by learning from subsets of increasing difficulty levels.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yang23g	Yu Yang, Hao Kang, Baharan Mirzasoleiman
Data Poisoning Attacks Against Multimodal Encoders	Recently, the newly emerged multimodal models, which leverage both visual and linguistic modalities to train powerful encoders, have gained increasing attention. However, learning from a large-scale unlabeled dataset also exposes the model to the risk of potential poisoning attacks, whereby the adversary aims to perturb the model's training data to trigger malicious behaviors in it. In contrast to previous work, only poisoning visual modality, in this work, we take the first step to studying poisoning attacks against multimodal models in both visual and linguistic modalities. Specially, we focus on answering two questions: (1) Is the linguistic modality also vulnerable to poisoning attacks? and (2) Which modality is most vulnerable? To answer the two questions, we propose three types of poisoning attacks against multimodal models. Extensive evaluations on different datasets and model architectures show that all three attacks can achieve significant attack performance while maintaining model utility in both visual and linguistic modalities. Furthermore, we observe that the poisoning effect differs between different modalities. To mitigate the attacks, we propose both pre-training and post-training defenses. We empirically show that both defenses can significantly reduce the attack performance while preserving the model's utility. Our code is available at https://github.com/zqypku/mm_poison/.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yang23f	Ziqing Yang, Xinlei He, Zheng Li, Michael Backes, Mathias Humbert, Pascal Berrang, Yang Zhang
Chemically Transferable Generative Backmapping of Coarse-Grained Proteins	Coarse-graining (CG) accelerates molecular simulations of protein dynamics by simulating sets of atoms as singular beads. Backmapping is the opposite operation of bringing lost atomistic details back from the CG representation. While machine learning (ML) has produced accurate and efficient CG simulations of proteins, fast and reliable backmapping remains a challenge. Rule-based methods produce poor all-atom geometries, needing computationally costly refinement through additional simulations. Recently proposed ML approaches outperform traditional baselines but are not transferable between proteins and sometimes generate unphysical atom placements with steric clashes and implausible torsion angles. This work addresses both issues to build a fast, transferable, and reliable generative backmapping tool for CG protein representations. We achieve generalization and reliability through a combined set of innovations: representation based on internal coordinates; an equivariant encoder/prior; a custom loss function that helps ensure local structure, global structure, and physical constraints; and expert curation of high-quality out-of-equilibrium protein data for training. Our results pave the way for out-of-the-box backmapping of coarse-grained simulations for arbitrary proteins.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yang23e	Soojung Yang, Rafael Gomez-Bombarelli
Weighted Flow Diffusion for Local Graph Clustering with Node Attributes: an Algorithm and Statistical Guarantees	Local graph clustering methods aim to detect small clusters in very large graphs without the need to process the whole graph. They are fundamental and scalable tools for a wide range of tasks such as local community detection, node ranking and node embedding. While prior work on local graph clustering mainly focuses on graphs without node attributes, modern real-world graph datasets typically come with node attributes that provide valuable additional information. We present a simple local graph clustering algorithm for graphs with node attributes, based on the idea of diffusing mass locally in the graph while accounting for both structural and attribute proximities. Using high-dimensional concentration results, we provide statistical guarantees on the performance of the algorithm for the recovery of a target cluster with a single seed node. We give conditions under which a target cluster generated from a fairly general contextual random graph model, which includes both the stochastic block model and the planted cluster model as special cases, can be fully recovered with bounded false positives. Empirically, we validate all theoretical claims using synthetic data, and we show that incorporating node attributes leads to superior local clustering performances using real-world graph datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yang23d	Shenghao Yang, Kimon Fountoulakis
Towards Better Graph Representation Learning with Parameterized Decomposition & Filtering	Proposing an effective and flexible matrix to represent a graph is a fundamental challenge that has been explored from multiple perspectives, e.g., filtering in Graph Fourier Transforms. In this work, we develop a novel and general framework which unifies many existing GNN models from the view of parameterized decomposition and filtering, and show how it helps to enhance the flexibility of GNNs while alleviating the smoothness and amplification issues of existing models. Essentially, we show that the extensively studied spectral graph convolutions with learnable polynomial filters are constrained variants of this formulation, and releasing these constraints enables our model to express the desired decomposition and filtering simultaneously. Based on this generalized framework, we develop models that are simple in implementation but achieve significant improvements and computational efficiency on a variety of graph learning tasks.

Nested Elimination: A Simple Algorithm for Best-Item Identification From Choice-Based Feedback	We study the problem of best-item identification from choice-based feedback. In this problem, a company sequentially and adaptively shows display sets to a population of customers and collects their choices. The objective is to identify the most preferred item with the least number of samples and at a high confidence level. We propose an elimination-based algorithm, namely Nested Elimination (NE), which is inspired by the nested structure implied by the information-theoretic lower bound. NE is simple in structure, easy to implement, and has a strong theoretical guarantee for sample complexity. Specifically, NE utilizes an innovative elimination criterion and circumvents the need to solve any complex combinatorial optimization problem. We provide an instance-specific and non-asymptotic bound on the expected sample complexity of NE. We also show NE achieves high-order worst-case asymptotic optimality. Finally, numerical experiments from both synthetic and real data corroborate our theoretical findings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yang23b	Junwen Yang, Yifan Feng
Behavior Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Skill Discovery	In reinforcement learning, unsupervised skill discovery aims to learn diverse skills without extrinsic rewards. Previous methods discover skills by maximizing the mutual information (MI) between states and skills. However, such an MI objective tends to learn simple and static skills and may hinder exploration. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised skill discovery method through contrastive learning among behaviors, which makes the agent produce similar behaviors for the same skill and diverse behaviors for different skills. Under mild assumptions, our objective maximizes the MI between different behaviors based on the same skill, which serves as an upper bound of the previous MI objective. Meanwhile, our method implicitly increases the state entropy to obtain better state coverage. We evaluate our method on challenging mazes and continuous control tasks. The results show that our method generates diverse and far-reaching skills, and also obtains competitive performance in downstream tasks compared to the state-of-the-art methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yang23a	Rushuai Yang, Chenjia Bai, Hongyi Guo, Siyuan Li, Bin Zhao, Zhen Wang, Peng Liu, Xuelong Li
Proper Scoring Rules for Survival Analysis	Survival analysis is the problem of estimating probability distributions for future event times, which can be seen as a problem in uncertainty quantification. Although there are fundamental theories on strictly proper scoring rules for uncertainty quantification, little is known about those for survival analysis. In this paper, we investigate extensions of four major strictly proper scoring rules for survival analysis and we prove that these extensions are proper under certain conditions, which arise from the discretization of the estimation of probability distributions. We also compare the estimation performances of these extended scoring rules by using real datasets, and the extensions of the logarithmic score and the Brier score performed the best.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yanagisawa23a	Hiroki Yanagisawa

Quantum 3D Graph Learning with Applications to Molecule Embedding	Learning 3D graph with spatial position as well as node attributes has been recently actively studied, for its utility in different applications e.g. 3D molecules. Quantum computing is known a promising direction for its potential theoretical supremacy for large-scale graph and combinatorial problem as well as the increasing evidence for the availability to physical quantum devices in the near term. In this paper, for the first time to our best knowledge, we propose a quantum 3D embedding ansatz that learns the latent representation of 3D structures from the Hilbert space composed of the Bloch sphere of each qubit. Specifically, the 3D Cartesian coordinates of nodes are converted into rotation and torsion angles and then encode them into the form of qubits. Moreover, Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC) is applied to serve as the trainable layers and the output of the PQC is adopted as the final node embedding. Experimental results on two downstream tasks, molecular property prediction and 3D molecular geometries generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. We show the capacity and capability of our model with the evaluation on the QM9 dataset (134k molecules) with very few parameters, and its potential to be executed on a real quantum device.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yan23e	Ge Yan, Huaijin Wu, Junchi Yan
Self-Interpretable Time Series Prediction with Counterfactual Explanations	Interpretable time series prediction is crucial for safety-critical areas such as healthcare and autonomous driving. Most existing methods focus on interpreting predictions by assigning important scores to segments of time series. In this paper, we take a different and more challenging route and aim at developing a self-interpretable model, dubbed Counterfactual Time Series (CounTS), which generates counterfactual and actionable explanations for time series predictions. Specifically, we formalize the problem of time series counterfactual explanations, establish associated evaluation protocols, and propose a variational Bayesian deep learning model equipped with counterfactual inference capability of time series abduction, action, and prediction. Compared with state-of-the-art baselines, our self-interpretable model can generate better counterfactual explanations while maintaining comparable prediction accuracy.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yan23d	Jingquan Yan, Hao Wang
Distortion and Uncertainty Aware Loss for Panoramic Depth Completion	Standard MSE or MAE loss function is commonly used in limited field-of-vision depth completion, treating each pixel equally under a basic assumption that all pixels have same contribution during optimization. Recently, with the rapid rise of panoramic photography, panoramic depth completion (PDC) has raised increasing attention in 3D computer vision. However, the assumption is inapplicable to panoramic data due to its latitude-wise distortion and high uncertainty nearby textures and edges. To handle these challenges, we propose distortion and uncertainty aware loss (DUL) that consists of a distortion-aware loss and an uncertainty-aware loss. The distortion-aware loss is designed to tackle the panoramic distortion caused by equirectangular projection, whose coordinate transformation relation is used to adaptively calculate the weight of the latitude-wise distortion, distributing uneven importance instead of the equal treatment for each pixel. The uncertainty-aware loss is presented to handle the inaccuracy in non-smooth regions. Specifically, we characterize uncertainty into PDC solutions under Bayesian deep learning framework, where a novel consistent uncertainty estimation constraint is designed to learn the consistency between multiple uncertainty maps of a single panorama. This consistency constraint allows model to produce more precise uncertainty estimation that is robust to feature deformation. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method over standard loss functions, reaching the state of the art.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yan23c	Zhiqiang Yan, Xiang Li, Kun Wang, Shuo Chen, Jun Li, Jian Yang
Temporally Consistent Transformers for Video Generation	To generate accurate videos, algorithms have to understand the spatial and temporal dependencies in the world. Current algorithms enable accurate predictions over short horizons but tend to suffer from temporal inconsistencies. When generated content goes out of view and is later revisited, the model invents different content instead. Despite this severe limitation, no established benchmarks exist for video generation with long temporal dependencies. In this paper, we curate 3 challenging video datasets with long-range dependencies by rendering walks through 3D scenes of procedural mazes, Minecraft worlds, and indoor scans. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of current models and observe their limitations in temporal consistency. Moreover, we introduce the Temporally Consistent Transformer (TECO), a generative model that substantially improves long-term consistency while also reducing sampling time. By compressing its input sequence into fewer embeddings, applying a temporal transformer, and expanding back using a spatial MaskGit, TECO outperforms existing models across many metrics.

Compressed Decentralized Proximal Stochastic Gradient Method for Nonconvex Composite Problems with Heterogeneous Data	We first propose a decentralized proximal stochastic gradient tracking method (DProxSGT) for nonconvex stochastic composite problems, with data heterogeneously distributed on multiple workers in a decentralized connected network. To save communication cost, we then extend DProxSGT to a compressed method by compressing the communicated information. Both methods need only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ samples per worker for each proximal update, which is important to achieve good generalization performance on training deep neural networks. With a smoothness condition on the expected loss function (but not on each sample function), the proposed methods can achieve an optimal sample complexity result to produce a near-stationary point. Numerical experiments on training neural networks demonstrate the significantly better generalization performance of our methods over large-batch training methods and momentum variance-reduction methods and also, the ability of handling heterogeneous data by the gradient tracking scheme.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yan23a	Yonggui Yan, Jie Chen, Pin-Yu Chen, Xiaodong Cui, Songtao Lu, Yangyang Xu
Quantum Ridgelet Transform: Winning Lottery Ticket of Neural Networks with Quantum Computation	A significant challenge in the field of quantum machine learning (QML) is to establish applications of quantum computation to accelerate common tasks in machine learning such as those for neural networks. Ridgelet transform has been a fundamental mathematical tool in the theoretical studies of neural networks, but the practical applicability of ridgelet transform to conducting learning tasks was limited since its numerical implementation by conventional classical computation requires an exponential runtime $\exp(O(D))$ as data dimension $D$ increases. To address this problem, we develop a quantum ridgelet transform (QRT), which implements the ridgelet transform of a quantum state within a linear runtime $O(D)$ of quantum computation. As an application, we also show that one can use QRT as a fundamental subroutine for QML to efficiently find a sparse trainable subnetwork of large shallow wide neural networks without conducting large-scale optimization of the original network. This application discovers an efficient way in this regime to demonstrate the lottery ticket hypothesis on finding such a sparse trainable neural network. These results open an avenue of QML for accelerating learning tasks with commonly used classical neural networks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yamasaki23a	Hayata Yamasaki, Sathyawageeswar Subramanian, Satoshi Hayakawa, Sho Sonoda
Q-learning Decision Transformer: Leveraging Dynamic Programming for Conditional Sequence Modelling in Offline RL	Recent works have shown that tackling offline reinforcement learning (RL) with a conditional policy produces promising results. The Decision Transformer (DT) combines the conditional policy approach and a transformer architecture, showing competitive performance against several benchmarks. However, DT lacks stitching ability – one of the critical abilities for offline RL to learn the optimal policy from sub-optimal trajectories. This issue becomes particularly significant when the offline dataset only contains sub-optimal trajectories. On the other hand, the conventional RL approaches based on Dynamic Programming (such as Q-learning) do not have the same limitation; however, they suffer from unstable learning behaviours, especially when they rely on function approximation in an off-policy learning setting. In this paper, we propose the Q-learning Decision Transformer (QDT) to address the shortcomings of DT by leveraging the benefits of Dynamic Programming (Q-learning). It utilises the Dynamic Programming results to relabel the return-to-go in the training data to then train the DT with the relabelled data. Our approach efficiently exploits the benefits of these two approaches and compensates for each other's shortcomings to achieve better performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/yamagata23a	Taku Yamagata, Ahmed Khalil, Raul Santos-Rodriguez
Adaptive Computation with Elastic Input Sequence	Humans have the ability to adapt the type of information they use, the procedure they employ, and the amount of time they spend when solving problems. However, most standard neural networks have a fixed function type and computation budget regardless of the sample's nature or difficulty. Adaptivity is a powerful paradigm as it not only imbues practitioners with flexibility pertaining to the downstream usage of these models but can also serve as a powerful inductive bias for solving certain challenging classes of problems. In this work, we introduce a new approach called AdaTape, which allows for dynamic computation in neural networks through adaptive tape tokens. AdaTape utilizes an elastic input sequence by equipping an architecture with a dynamic read-and-write tape. Specifically, we adaptively generate input sequences using tape tokens obtained from a tape bank which can be either trainable or derived from input data. We examine the challenges and requirements to obtain dynamic sequence content and length, and propose the Adaptive Tape Reading (ATR) algorithm to achieve both goals. Through extensive experiments on image recognition tasks, we show that AdaTape can achieve better performance while maintaining the computational cost. To facilitate further research, we have released code at https://github.com/google-research/scenic/tree/main/scenic/projects/adatape.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xue23e	Fuzhao Xue, Valerii Likhosherstov, Anurag Arnab, Neil Houlsby, Mostafa Dehghani, Yang You

LazyGNN: Large-Scale Graph Neural Networks via Lazy Propagation	Recent works have demonstrated the benefits of capturing long-distance dependency in graphs by deeper graph neural networks (GNNs). But deeper GNNs suffer from the long-lasting scalability challenge due to the neighborhood explosion problem in large-scale graphs. In this work, we propose to capture long-distance dependency in graphs by shallower models instead of deeper models, which leads to a much more efficient model, LazyGNN, for graph representation learning. Moreover, we demonstrate that LazyGNN is compatible with existing scalable approaches (such as sampling methods) for further accelerations through the development of mini-batch LazyGNN. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its superior prediction performance and scalability on large-scale benchmarks. The implementation of LazyGNN is available at https: //github.com/RXPHD/Lazy_GNN.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xue23c	Rui Xue, Haoyu Han, Mohamadali Torkamani, Jian Pei, Xiaorui Liu
A Study on Transformer Configuration and Training Objective	"Transformer-based models have delivered impressive results on many tasks, particularly vision and language tasks. In many model training situations, conventional configurations are often adopted. For example, we usually set the base model with hidden size (i.e. model width) to be 768 and the number of transformer layers (i.e. model depth) to be 12. In this paper, we revisit these conventional configurations by studying the the relationship between transformer configuration and training objective. We show that the optimal transformer configuration is closely related to the training objective. Specifically, compared with the simple classification objective, the masked autoencoder is effective in alleviating the over-smoothing issue in deep transformer training. Based on this finding, we propose ""Bamboo"", a notion of using deeper and narrower transformer configurations, for masked autoencoder training. On ImageNet, with such a simple change in configuration, the re-designed Base-level transformer achieves 84.2% top-1 accuracy and outperforms SoTA models like MAE by $0.9%$. On language tasks, re-designed model outperforms BERT with the default setting by 1.1 points on average, on GLUE benchmark with 8 datasets."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xue23b	Fuzhao Xue, Jianghai Chen, Aixin Sun, Xiaozhe Ren, Zangwei Zheng, Xiaoxin He, Yongming Chen, Xin Jiang, Yang You
Near-Optimal Quantum Coreset Construction Algorithms for Clustering	$k$-Clustering in $\mathbb{R}^d$ (e.g., $k$-median and $k$-means) is a fundamental machine learning problem. While near-linear time approximation algorithms were known in the classical setting for a dataset with cardinality $n$, it remains open to find sublinear-time quantum algorithms. We give quantum algorithms that find coresets for $k$-clustering in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{nk}d^{3/2})$ query complexity. Our coreset reduces the input size from $n$ to $\mathrm{poly}(k\epsilon^{-1}d)$, so that existing $\alpha$-approximation algorithms for clustering can run on top of it and yield $(1 + \epsilon)\alpha$-approximation. This eventually yields a quadratic speedup for various $k$-clustering approximation algorithms. We complement our algorithm with a nearly matching lower bound, that any quantum algorithm must make $\Omega(\sqrt{nk})$ queries in order to achieve even $O(1)$-approximation for $k$-clustering.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xue23a	Yecheng Xue, Xiaoyu Chen, Tongyang Li, Shaofeng H.-C.

An Instrumental Variable Approach to Confounded Off-Policy Evaluation	Off-policy evaluation (OPE) aims to estimate the return of a target policy using some pre-collected observational data generated by a potentially different behavior policy. In many cases, there exist unmeasured variables that confound the action-reward or action-next-state relationships, rendering many existing OPE approaches ineffective. This paper develops an instrumental variable (IV)-based method for consistent OPE in confounded sequential decision making. Similar to single-stage decision making, we show that IV enables us to correctly identify the target policy's value in infinite horizon settings as well. Furthermore, we propose a number of policy value estimators and illustrate their effectiveness through extensive simulations and real data analysis from a world-leading short-video platform.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xu23x	Yang Xu, Jin Zhu, Chengchun Shi, Shikai Luo, Rui Song
Do Not Train It: A Linear Neural Architecture Search of Graph Neural Networks	Neural architecture search (NAS) for Graph neural networks (GNNs), called NAS-GNNs, has achieved significant performance over manually designed GNN architectures. However, these methods inherit issues from the conventional NAS methods, such as high computational cost and optimization difficulty. More importantly, previous NAS methods have ignored the uniqueness of GNNs, where GNNs possess expressive power without training. With the randomly-initialized weights, we can then seek the optimal architecture parameters via the sparse coding objective and derive a novel NAS-GNNs method, namely neural architecture coding (NAC). Consequently, our NAC holds a no-update scheme on GNNs and can efficiently compute in linear time. Empirical evaluations on multiple GNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance, which is up to $200\times$ faster and $18.8%$ more accurate than the strong baselines.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xu23w	Peng Xu, Lin Zhang, Xuanzhou Liu, Jiaqi Sun, Yue Zhao, Haiqin Yang, Bei Yu
SLAMB: Accelerated Large Batch Training with Sparse Communication	Distributed training of large deep neural networks requires frequent exchange of massive data between machines, thus communication efficiency is a major concern. Existing compressed communication methods are either not compatible with large batch optimization algorithms, or do not provide sufficient speedup in large scale. In this paper, we combine sparsification-based gradient compression with the layer-wise adaptive moments optimizer for large batch training (LAMB). We propose SLAMB, a novel communication-efficient optimizer that supports large batch sizes and scales to thousands of GPUs. SLAMB employs momentum masking, local error compensation, and element-wise adaptive rescaling to achieve accurate layer-wise weight updates, which translates to fast convergence for very large batches. Our empirical results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art, SLAMB transmits half the amount of data in large-batch BERT pre-training, without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, SLAMB achieves excellent scalability in large computing infrastructures. For instance, SLAMB with 128 GPUs reduces the training time of Swin Transformer pre-training on ImageNet to 5.35 hours, which is 2 hours faster than the state-of-the-art. At the extreme, we trained BERT-XL (2.8B parameters) on 1,024 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, where SLAMB achieved 90% scaling efficiency.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xu23v	Hang Xu, Wenxuan Zhang, Jiawei Fei, Yuzhe Wu, Tingwen Xie, Jun Huang, Yuchen Xie, Mohamed Elhoseiny, Panos Kalnis
Bayesian Design Principles for Frequentist Sequential Learning	"We develop a general theory to optimize the frequentist regret for sequential learning problems, where efficient bandit and reinforcement learning algorithms can be derived from unified Bayesian principles. We propose a novel optimization approach to create ""algorithmic beliefs"" at each round, and use Bayesian posteriors to make decisions. This is the first approach to make Bayesian-type algorithms prior-free and applicable to adversarial settings, in a generic and optimal manner. Moreover, the algorithms are simple and often efficient to implement. As a major application, we present a novel algorithm for multi-armed bandits that achieves the ""best-of-all-worlds"" empirical performance in the stochastic, adversarial, and non-stationary environments. And we illustrate how these principles can be used in linear bandits, convex bandits, and reinforcement learning."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xu23u	Yunbei Xu, Assaf Zeevi
ProtST: Multi-Modality Learning of Protein Sequences and Biomedical Texts	Current protein language models (PLMs) learn protein representations mainly based on their sequences, thereby well capturing co-evolutionary information, but they are unable to explicitly acquire protein functions, which is the end goal of protein representation learning. Fortunately, for many proteins, their textual property descriptions are available, where their various functions are also described. Motivated by this fact, we first build the ProtDescribe dataset to augment protein sequences with text descriptions of their functions and other important properties. Based on this dataset, we propose the ProtST framework to enhance Protein Sequence pre-training and understanding by biomedical Texts. During pre-training, we design three types of tasks, i.e., unimodal mask prediction, multimodal representation alignment and multimodal mask prediction, to enhance a PLM with protein property information with different granularities and, at the same time, preserve the PLM's original representation power. On downstream tasks, ProtST enables both supervised learning and zero-shot prediction. We verify the superiority of ProtST-induced PLMs over previous ones on diverse representation learning benchmarks. Under the zero-shot setting, we show the effectiveness of ProtST on zero-shot protein classification, and ProtST also enables functional protein retrieval from a large-scale database without any function annotation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xu23t	Minghao Xu, Xinyu Yuan, Santiago Miret, Jian Tang
mPLUG-2: A Modularized Multi-modal Foundation Model Across Text, Image and Video	Recent years have witnessed a big convergence of language, vision, and multi-modal pretraining. In this work, we present mPLUG-2, a new unified paradigm with modularized design for multi-modal pretraining, which can benefit from modality collaboration while addressing the problem of modality entanglement. In contrast to predominant paradigms of solely relying on sequence-to-sequence generation or encoder-based instance discrimination, mPLUG-2 introduces a multi-module composition network by sharing common universal modules for modality collaboration and disentangling different modality modules to deal with modality entanglement. It is flexible to select different modules for different understanding and generation tasks across all modalities including text, image, and video. Empirical study shows that mPLUG-2 achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results on a broad range of over 30 downstream tasks, spanning multi-modal tasks of image-text and video-text understanding and generation, and uni-modal tasks of text-only, image-only, and video-only understanding. Notably, mPLUG-2 shows new state-of-the-art results of 48.0 top-1 accuracy and 80.3 CIDEr on the challenging MSRVTT video QA and video caption tasks with a far smaller model size and data scale. It also demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability on vision-language and video-language tasks.

Competing for Shareable Arms in Multi-Player Multi-Armed Bandits	Competitions for shareable and limited resources have long been studied with strategic agents. In reality, agents often have to learn and maximize the rewards of the resources at the same time. To design an individualized competing policy, we model the competition between agents in a novel multi-player multi-armed bandit (MPMAB) setting where players are selfish and aim to maximize their own rewards. In addition, when several players pull the same arm, we assume that these players averagely share the arms' rewards by expectation. Under this setting, we first analyze the Nash equilibrium when arms' rewards are known. Subsequently, we propose a novel Selfish MPMAB with Averaging Allocation (SMAA) approach based on the equilibrium. We theoretically demonstrate that SMAA could achieve a good regret guarantee for each player when all players follow the algorithm. Additionally, we establish that no single selfish player can significantly increase their rewards through deviation, nor can they detrimentally affect other players' rewards without incurring substantial losses for themselves. We finally validate the effectiveness of the method in extensive synthetic experiments.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xu23q	Renzhe Xu, Haotian Wang, Xingxuan Zhang, Bo Li, Peng Cui
Fascinating Supervisory Signals and Where to Find Them: Deep Anomaly Detection with Scale Learning	"Due to the unsupervised nature of anomaly detection, the key to fueling deep models is finding supervisory signals. Different from current reconstruction-guided generative models and transformation-based contrastive models, we devise novel data-driven supervision for tabular data by introducing a characteristic – scale – as data labels. By representing varied sub-vectors of data instances, we define scale as the relationship between the dimensionality of original sub-vectors and that of representations. Scales serve as labels attached to transformed representations, thus offering ample labeled data for neural network training. This paper further proposes a scale learning-based anomaly detection method. Supervised by the learning objective of scale distribution alignment, our approach learns the ranking of representations converted from varied subspaces of each data instance. Through this proxy task, our approach models inherent regularities and patterns within data, which well describes data ""normality"". Abnormal degrees of testing instances are obtained by measuring whether they fit these learned patterns. Extensive experiments show that our approach leads to significant improvement over state-of-the-art generative/contrastive anomaly detection methods."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xu23p	Hongzuo Xu, Yijie Wang, Juhui Wei, Songlei Jian, Yizhou Li, Ning Liu
The Power of Preconditioning in Overparameterized Low-Rank Matrix Sensing	We propose $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$, a preconditioned gradient descent method to tackle the low-rank matrix sensing problem when the true rank is unknown, and when the matrix is possibly ill-conditioned. Using overparametrized factor representations, $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$ starts from a small random initialization, and proceeds by gradient descent with a specific form of preconditioning with a fixed damping term to combat overparameterization. At the expense of light computational overhead incurred by preconditioners, $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$ is remarkably robust to ill-conditioning compared to vanilla gradient descent ($\mathsf{GD}$). Specifically, we show that, under the Gaussian design, $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$ converges to the true low-rank matrix at a constant linear rate that is independent of the condition number (apart from a short nearly dimension-free burdening period), with near-optimal sample complexity. This significantly improves upon the convergence rate of vanilla $\mathsf{GD}$ which suffers from a polynomial dependency with the condition number. Our work provides evidence on the power of preconditioning in accelerating the convergence without hurting generalization in overparameterized learning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xu23o	Xingyu Xu, Yandi Shen, Yuejie Chi, Cong Ma
Geometric Latent Diffusion Models for 3D Molecule Generation	Generative models, especially diffusion models (DMs), have achieved promising results for generating feature-rich geometries and advancing foundational science problems such as molecule design. Inspired by the recent huge success of Stable (latent) Diffusion models, we propose a novel and principled method for 3D molecule generation named Geometric Latent Diffusion Models (GeoLDM). GeoLDM is the first latent DM model for the molecular geometry domain, composed of autoencoders encoding structures into continuous latent codes and DMs operating in the latent space. Our key innovation is that for modeling the 3D molecular geometries, we capture its critical roto-translational equivariance constraints by building a point-structured latent space with both invariant scalars and equivariant tensors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoLDM can consistently achieve better performance on multiple molecule generation benchmarks, with up to 7% improvement for the valid percentage of large biomolecules. Results also demonstrate GeoLDM's higher capacity for controllable generation thanks to the latent modeling.

PFGM++: Unlocking the Potential of Physics-Inspired Generative Models	We introduce a new family of physics-inspired generative models termed PFGM++ that unifies diffusion models and Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM). These models realize generative trajectories for N dimensional data by embedding paths in N+D dimensional space while still controlling the progression with a simple scalar norm of the D additional variables. The new models reduce to PFGM when D=1 and to diffusion models when D$\to\infty$. The flexibility of choosing D allows us to trade off robustness against rigidity as increasing D results in more concentrated coupling between the data and the additional variable norms. We dispense with the biased large batch field targets used in PFGM and instead provide an unbiased perturbation-based objective similar to diffusion models. To explore different choices of D, we provide a direct alignment method for transferring well-tuned hyperparameters from diffusion models (D$\to\infty$) to any finite D values. Our experiments show that models with finite D can be superior to previous state-of-the-art diffusion models on CIFAR-10/FFHQ 64$\times$64 datasets/LSUN Churches 256$\times$256, with median Ds. In class-conditional setting, D=2048 yields current state-of-the-art FID of 1.74 on CIFAR-10 without additional training. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models with smaller $D$ exhibit improved robustness against modeling errors.

Progressive Purification for Instance-Dependent Partial Label Learning	Partial label learning (PLL) aims to train multiclass classifiers from the examples each annotated with a set of candidate labels where a fixed but unknown candidate label is correct. In the last few years, the instance-independent generation process of candidate labels has been extensively studied, on the basis of which many theoretical advances have been made in PLL. Nevertheless, the candidate labels are always instance-dependent in practice and there is no theoretical guarantee that the model trained on the instance-dependent PLL examples can converge to an ideal one. In this paper, a theoretically grounded and practically effective approach named POP, i.e. PrOgressive Purification for instance-dependent partial label learning, is proposed. Specifically, POP updates the learning model and purifies each candidate label set progressively in every epoch. Theoretically, we prove that POP enlarges the region appropriately fast where the model is reliable, and eventually approximates the Bayes optimal classifier with mild assumptions. Technically, POP is flexible with arbitrary PLL losses and could improve the performance of the previous PLL losses in the instance-dependent case. Experiments on the benchmark datasets and the real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xu23l	Ning Xu, Biao Liu, Jiaqi Lv, Congyu Qiao, Xin Geng
Quantifying the Variability Collapse of Neural Networks	Recent studies empirically demonstrate the positive relationship between the transferability of neural networks and the in-class variation of the last layer features. The recently discovered Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon provides a new perspective of understanding such last layer geometry of neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel metric, named Variability Collapse Index (VCI), to quantify the variability collapse phenomenon in the NC paradigm. The VCI metric is well-motivated and intrinsically related to the linear probing loss on the last layer features. Moreover, it enjoys desired theoretical and empirical properties, including invariance under invertible linear transformations and numerical stability, that distinguishes it from previous metrics. Our experiments verify that VCI is indicative of the variability collapse and the transferability of pretrained neural networks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xu23k	Jing Xu, Haoxiong Liu
Diverse and Faithful Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Generation via Sequential Posterior Inference	The capability to generate responses with diversity and faithfulness using factual knowledge is paramount for creating a human-like, trustworthy dialogue system. Common strategies either adopt a two-step paradigm, which optimizes knowledge selection and response generation separately, and may overlook the inherent correlation between these two tasks, or leverage conditional variational method to jointly optimize knowledge selection and response generation by employing an inference network. In this paper, we present an end-to-end learning framework, termed Sequential Posterior Inference (SPI), capable of selecting knowledge and generating dialogues by approximately sampling from the posterior distribution. Unlike other methods, SPI does not require the inference network or assume a simple geometry of the posterior distribution. This straightforward and intuitive inference procedure of SPI directly queries the response generation model, allowing for accurate knowledge selection and generation of faithful responses. In addition to modeling contributions, our experimental results on two common dialogue datasets (Wizard of Wikipedia and Holl-E) demonstrate that SPI outperforms previous strong baselines according to both automatic and human evaluation metrics.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xu23j	Yan Xu, Deqian Kong, Dehong Xu, Ziwei Ji, Bo Pang, Pascale Fung, Ying Nian Wu
Pareto Regret Analyses in Multi-objective Multi-armed Bandit	We study Pareto optimality in multi-objective multi-armed bandit by providing a formulation of adversarial multi-objective multi-armed bandit and defining its Pareto regrets that can be applied to both stochastic and adversarial settings. The regrets do not rely on any scalarization functions and reflect Pareto optimality compared to scalarized regrets. We also present new algorithms assuming both with and without prior information of the multi-objective multi-armed bandit setting. The algorithms are shown optimal in adversarial settings and nearly optimal up to a logarithmic factor in stochastic settings simultaneously by our established upper bounds and lower bounds on Pareto regrets. Moreover, the lower bound analyses show that the new regrets are consistent with the existing Pareto regret for stochastic settings and extend an adversarial attack mechanism from bandit to the multi-objective one.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xu23i	Mengfan Xu, Diego Klabjan
Constrained Efficient Global Optimization of Expensive Black-box Functions	We study the problem of constrained efficient global optimization, where both the objective and constraints are expensive black-box functions that can be learned with Gaussian processes. We propose CONFIG (CONstrained efFIcient Global Optimization), a simple and effective algorithm to solve it. Under certain regularity assumptions, we show that our algorithm enjoys the same cumulative regret bound as that in the unconstrained case and similar cumulative constraint violation upper bounds. For commonly used Matern and Squared Exponential kernels, our bounds are sublinear and allow us to derive a convergence rate to the optimal solution of the original constrained problem. In addition, our method naturally provides a scheme to declare infeasibility when the original black-box optimization problem is infeasible. Numerical experiments on sampled instances from the Gaussian process, artificial numerical problems, and a black-box building controller tuning problem all demonstrate the competitive performance of our algorithm. Compared to the other state-of-the-art methods, our algorithm significantly improves the theoretical guarantees while achieving competitive empirical performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xu23h	Wenjie Xu, Yuning Jiang, Bratislav Svetozarevic, Colin Jones
Efficient Sequence Transduction by Jointly Predicting Tokens and Durations	This paper introduces a novel Token-and-Duration Transducer (TDT) architecture for sequence-to-sequence tasks. TDT extends conventional RNN-Transducer architectures by jointly predicting both a token and its duration, i.e. the number of input frames covered by the emitted token. This is achieved by using a joint network with two outputs which are independently normalized to generate distributions over tokens and durations. During inference, TDT models can skip input frames guided by the predicted duration output, which makes them significantly faster than conventional Transducers which process the encoder output frame by frame. TDT models achieve both better accuracy and significantly faster inference than conventional Transducers on different sequence transduction tasks. TDT models for Speech Recognition achieve better accuracy and up to 2.82X faster inference than conventional Transducers. TDT models for Speech Translation achieve an absolute gain of over 1 BLEU on the MUST-C test compared with conventional Transducers, and its inference is 2.27X faster. In Speech Intent Classification and Slot Filling tasks, TDT models improve the intent accuracy by up to over 1% (absolute) over conventional Transducers, while running up to 1.28X faster. Our implementation of the TDT model will be open-sourced with the NeMo (https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) toolkit.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xu23g	Hainan Xu, Fei Jia, Somshubra Majumdar, He Huang, Shinji Watanabe, Boris Ginsburg
Hierarchical Neural Coding for Controllable CAD Model Generation	"This paper presents a novel generative model for Computer Aided Design (CAD) that 1) represents high-level design concepts of a CAD model as a three-level hierarchical tree of neural codes, from global part arrangement down to local curve geometry; and 2) controls the generation or completion of CAD models by specifying the target design using a code tree. Concretely, a novel variant of a vector quantized VAE with ""masked skip connection"" extracts design variations as neural codebooks at three levels. Two-stage cascaded auto-regressive transformers learn to generate code trees from incomplete CAD models and then complete CAD models following the intended design. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance on conventional tasks such as unconditional generation while enabling novel interaction capabilities on conditional generation tasks.

Probabilistic Categorical Adversarial Attack and Adversarial Training	The studies on adversarial attacks and defenses have greatly improved the robustness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Most advanced approaches have been overwhelmingly designed for continuous data such as images. However, these achievements are still hard to be generalized to categorical data. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework, Probabilistic Categorical Adversarial Attack (or PCAA). It transfers the discrete optimization problem of finding categorical adversarial examples to a continuous problem that can be solved via gradient-based methods. We analyze the optimality (attack success rate) and time complexity of PCAA to demonstrate its significant advantage over current search-based attacks. More importantly, through extensive empirical studies, we demonstrate that the well-established defenses for continuous data, such as adversarial training and TRADES, can be easily accommodated to defend DNNs for categorical data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xu23e	Han Xu, Pengfei He, Jie Ren, Yuxuan Wan, Zitao Liu, Hui Liu, Jiliang Tang
Regret Bounds for Markov Decision Processes with Recursive Optimized Certainty Equivalents	The optimized certainty equivalent (OCE) is a family of risk measures that cover important examples such as entropic risk, conditional value-at-risk and mean-variance models. In this paper, we propose a new episodic risk-sensitive reinforcement learning formulation based on tabular Markov decision processes with recursive OCEs. We design an efficient learning algorithm for this problem based on value iteration and upper confidence bound. We derive an upper bound on the regret of the proposed algorithm, and also establish a minimax lower bound. Our bounds show that the regret rate achieved by our proposed algorithm has optimal dependence on the number of episodes and the number of actions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xu23d	Wenhao Xu, Xuefeng Gao, Xuedong He
Bit Allocation using Optimization	In this paper, we consider the problem of bit allocation in Neural Video Compression (NVC). First, we reveal a fundamental relationship between bit allocation in NVC and Semi-Amortized Variational Inference (SAVI). Specifically, we show that SAVI with GoP (Group-of-Picture)-level likelihood is equivalent to pixel-level bit allocation with precise rate & quality dependency model. Based on this equivalence, we establish a new paradigm of bit allocation using SAVI. Different from previous bit allocation methods, our approach requires no empirical model and is thus optimal. Moreover, as the original SAVI using gradient ascent only applies to single-level latent, we extend the SAVI to multi-level such as NVC by recursively applying back-propagating through gradient ascent. Finally, we propose a tractable approximation for practical implementation. Our method can be applied to scenarios where performance outweights encoding speed, and serves as an empirical bound on the R-D performance of bit allocation. Experimental results show that current state-of-the-art bit allocation algorithms still have a room of $\approx 0.5$ dB PSNR to improve compared with ours.

MixFlows: principled variational inference via mixed flows	This work presents mixed variational flows (MixFlows), a new variational family that consists of a mixture of repeated applications of a map to an initial reference distribution. First, we provide efficient algorithms for i.i.d. sampling, density evaluation, and unbiased ELBO estimation. We then show that MixFlows have MCMC-like convergence guarantees when the flow map is ergodic and measure-preserving, and provide bounds on the accumulation of error for practical implementations where the flow map is approximated. Finally, we develop an implementation of MixFlows based on uncorrected discretized Hamiltonian dynamics combined with deterministic momentum refreshment. Simulated and real data experiments show that MixFlows can provide more reliable posterior approximations than several black-box normalizing flows, as well as samples of comparable quality to those obtained from state-of-the-art MCMC methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xu23b	Zuheng Xu, Naitong Chen, Trevor Campbell
Why do Nearest Neighbor Language Models Work?	Language models (LMs) compute the probability of a text by sequentially computing a representation of an already-seen context and using this representation to predict the next word. Currently, most LMs calculate these representations through a neural network consuming the immediate previous context. However recently, retrieval-augmented LMs have shown to improve over standard neural LMs, by accessing information retrieved from a large datastore, in addition to their standard, parametric, next-word prediction. In this paper, we set out to understand why retrieval-augmented language models, and specifically why k-nearest neighbor language models (kNN-LMs) perform better than standard parametric LMs, even when the k-nearest neighbor component retrieves examples from the same training set that the LM was originally trained on. To this end, we perform analysis of various dimensions over which kNN-LM diverges from standard LMs, and investigate these dimensions one by one. Empirically, we identify three main reasons why kNN-LM performs better than standard LMs: using a different input representation for predicting the next tokens, approximate kNN search, and the importance of softmax temperature for the kNN distribution. Further, we incorporate some insights into the standard parametric LM, improving performance without the need for an explicit retrieval component.

Relevant Walk Search for Explaining Graph Neural Networks	Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become important machine learning tools for graph analysis, and its explainability is crucial for safety, fairness, and robustness. Layer-wise relevance propagation for GNNs (GNN-LRP) evaluates the relevance of walks to reveal important information flows in the network, and provides higher-order explanations, which have been shown to be superior to the lower-order, i.e., node-/edge-level, explanations. However, identifying relevant walks by GNN-LRP requires exponential computational complexity with respect to the network depth, which we will remedy in this paper. Specifically, we propose polynomial-time algorithms for finding top-$K$ relevant walks, which drastically reduces the computation and thus increases the applicability of GNN-LRP to large-scale problems. Our proposed algorithms are based on the max-product algorithm—a common tool for finding the maximum likelihood configurations in probabilistic graphical models—and can find the most relevant walks exactly at the neuron level and approximately at the node level. Our experiments demonstrate the performance of our algorithms at scale and their utility across application domains, i.e., on epidemiology, molecular, and natural language benchmarks.

Universal Morphology Control via Contextual Modulation	Learning a universal policy across different robot morphologies can significantly improve learning efficiency and generalization in continuous control. However, it poses a challenging multi-task reinforcement learning problem, as the optimal policy may be quite different across robots and critically depend on the morphology. Existing methods utilize graph neural networks or transformers to handle heterogeneous state and action spaces across different morphologies, but pay little attention to the dependency of a robot's control policy on its morphology context. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical architecture to better model this dependency via contextual modulation, which includes two key submodules: (1) Instead of enforcing hard parameter sharing across robots, we use hypernetworks to generate morphology-dependent control parameters; (2) We propose a fixed attention mechanism that solely depends on the morphology to modulate the interactions between different limbs in a robot. Experimental results show that our method not only improves learning performance on a diverse set of training robots, but also generalizes better to unseen morphologies in a zero-shot fashion.

Controlling Type Confounding in Ad Hoc Teamwork with Instance-wise Teammate Feedback Rectification	Ad hoc teamwork requires an agent to cooperate with unknown teammates without prior coordination. Many works propose to abstract teammate instances into high-level representation of types and then pre-train the best response for each type. However, most of them do not consider the distribution of teammate instances within a type. This could expose the agent to the hidden risk of type confounding. In the worst case, the best response for an abstract teammate type could be the worst response for all specific instances of that type. This work addresses the issue from the lens of causal inference. We first theoretically demonstrate that this phenomenon is due to the spurious correlation brought by uncontrolled teammate distribution. Then, we propose our solution, CTCAT, which disentangles such correlation through an instance-wise teammate feedback rectification. This operation reweights the interaction of teammate instances within a shared type to reduce the influence of type confounding. The effect of CTCAT is evaluated in multiple domains, including classic ad hoc teamwork tasks and real-world scenarios. Results show that CTCAT is robust to the influence of type confounding, a practical issue that directly hazards the robustness of our trained agents but was unnoticed in previous works.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xing23a	Dong Xing, Pengjie Gu, Qian Zheng, Xinrun Wang, Shanqi Liu, Longtao Zheng, Bo An, Gang Pan
A Critical View of Vision-Based Long-Term Dynamics Prediction Under Environment Misalignment	Dynamics prediction, which is the problem of predicting future states of scene objects based on current and prior states, is drawing increasing attention as an instance of learning physics. To solve this problem, Region Proposal Convolutional Interaction Network (RPCIN), a vision-based model, was proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance in long-term prediction. RPCIN only takes raw images and simple object descriptions, such as the bounding box and segmentation mask of each object, as input. However, despite its success, the model's capability can be compromised under conditions of environment misalignment. In this paper, we investigate two challenging conditions for environment misalignment: Cross-Domain and Cross-Context by proposing four datasets that are designed for these challenges: SimB-Border, SimB-Split, BlenB-Border, and BlenB-Split. The datasets cover two domains and two contexts. Using RPCIN as a probe, experiments conducted on the combinations of the proposed datasets reveal potential weaknesses of the vision-based long-term dynamics prediction model. Furthermore, we propose a promising direction to mitigate the Cross-Domain challenge and provide concrete evidence supporting such a direction, which provides dramatic alleviation of the challenge on the proposed datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xie23e	Hanchen Xie, Jiageng Zhu, Mahyar Khayatkhoei, Jiazhi Li, Mohamed E.

Semiparametrically Efficient Off-Policy Evaluation in Linear Markov Decision Processes	We study semiparametrically efficient estimation in off-policy evaluation (OPE) where the underlying Markov decision process (MDP) is linear with a known feature map. We characterize the variance lower bound for regular estimators in the linear MDP setting and propose an efficient estimator whose variance achieves that lower bound. Consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimator are established under mild conditions, which merely requires the only infinite-dimensional nuisance parameter to be estimated at a $n^{-1/4}$ convergence rate. We also construct an asymptotically valid confidence interval for statistical inference and conduct simulation studies to validate our results. To our knowledge, this is the first work that concerns efficient estimation in the presence of a known structure of MDPs in the OPE literature.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xie23d	Chuhan Xie, Wenhao Yang, Zhihua Zhang
DeSRA: Detect and Delete the Artifacts of GAN-based Real-World Super-Resolution Models	"Image super-resolution (SR) with generative adversarial networks (GAN) has achieved great success in restoring realistic details. However, it is notorious that GAN-based SR models will inevitably produce unpleasant and undesirable artifacts, especially in practical scenarios. Previous works typically suppress artifacts with an extra loss penalty in the training phase. They only work for in-distribution artifact types generated during training. When applied in real-world scenarios, we observe that those improved methods still generate obviously annoying artifacts during inference. In this paper, we analyze the cause and characteristics of the GAN artifacts produced in unseen test data without ground-truths. We then develop a novel method, namely, DeSRA, to Detect and then ""Delete"" those SR Artifacts in practice. Specifically, we propose to measure a relative local variance distance from MSE-SR results and GAN-SR results, and locate the problematic areas based on the above distance and semantic-aware thresholds. After detecting the artifact regions, we develop a finetune procedure to improve GAN-based SR models with a few samples, so that they can deal with similar types of artifacts in more unseen real data. Equipped with our DeSRA, we can successfully eliminate artifacts from inference and improve the ability of SR models to be applied in real-world scenarios. The code will be available at https://github.com/TencentARC/DeSRA."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xie23c	Liangbin Xie, Xintao Wang, Xiangyu Chen, Gen Li, Ying Shan, Jiantao Zhou, Chao Dong
Future-conditioned Unsupervised Pretraining for Decision Transformer	Recent research in offline reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated that return-conditioned supervised learning is a powerful paradigm for decision-making problems. While promising, return conditioning is limited to training data labeled with rewards and therefore faces challenges in learning from unsupervised data. In this work, we aim to utilize generalized future conditioning to enable efficient unsupervised pretraining from reward-free and sub-optimal offline data. We propose Pretrained Decision Transformer (PDT), a conceptually simple approach for unsupervised RL pretraining. PDT leverages future trajectory information as a privileged context to predict actions during training. The ability to make decisions based on both present and future factors enhances PDT's capability for generalization. Besides, this feature can be easily incorporated into a return-conditioned framework for online finetuning, by assigning return values to possible futures and sampling future embeddings based on their respective values. Empirically, PDT outperforms or performs on par with its supervised pretraining counterpart, especially when dealing with sub-optimal data. Further analysis reveals that PDT can extract diverse behaviors from offline data and controllably sample high-return behaviors by online finetuning. Code is available at here.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xie23b	Zhihui Xie, Zichuan Lin, Deheng Ye, Qiang Fu, Yang Wei, Shuai Li
Improving Bi-level Optimization Based Methods with Inspiration from Humans’ Classroom Study Techniques	In humans' classroom learning, many effective study techniques (e.g., the Feynman technique, peer questioning, etc.) have been developed to improve learning outcomes. We are interested in investigating whether these techniques can inspire the development of ML training strategies to improve bi-level optimization (BLO) based methods. Towards this goal, we develop a general framework, Skillearn, which consists of basic elements such as learners, interaction functions, learning stages, etc. These elements can be flexibly configured to create various training strategies, each emulating a study technique of humans. In case studies, we apply Skillearn to create new training strategies, by emulating the Feynman technique and peer questioning, which are two broadly adopted techniques in humans' classroom learning. These training strategies are used for improving two BLO based applications including neural architecture search and data weighting. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xie23a	Pengtao Xie
COMCAT: Towards Efficient Compression and Customization of Attention-Based Vision Models	Attention-based vision models, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants, have shown promising performance in various computer vision tasks. However, these emerging architectures suffer from large model sizes and high computational costs, calling for efficient model compression solutions. To date, pruning ViTs has been well studied, while other compression strategies that have been widely applied in CNN compression, e.g., model factorization, is little explored in the context of ViT compression. This paper explores an efficient method for compressing vision transformers to enrich the toolset for obtaining compact attention-based vision models. Based on the new insight on the multi-head attention layer, we develop a highly efficient ViT compression solution, which outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning methods. For compressing DeiT-small and DeiT-base models on ImageNet, our proposed approach can achieve $0.45%$ and $0.76%$ higher top-1 accuracy even with fewer parameters. Our finding can also be applied to improve the customization efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models, with much faster training (up to $2.6\times$ speedup) and lower extra storage cost (up to $1927.5\times$ reduction) than the existing works.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xiao23e	Jinqi Xiao, Miao Yin, Yu Gong, Xiao Zang, Jian Ren, Bo Yuan
On the Forward Invariance of Neural ODEs	We propose a new method to ensure neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) satisfy output specifications by using invariance set propagation. Our approach uses a class of control barrier functions to transform output specifications into constraints on the parameters and inputs of the learning system. This setup allows us to achieve output specification guarantees simply by changing the constrained parameters/inputs both during training and inference. Moreover, we demonstrate that our invariance set propagation through data-controlled neural ODEs not only maintains generalization performance but also creates an additional degree of robustness by enabling causal manipulation of the system's parameters/inputs. We test our method on a series of representation learning tasks, including modeling physical dynamics and convexity portraits, as well as safe collision avoidance for autonomous vehicles.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xiao23d	Wei Xiao, Tsun-Hsuan Wang, Ramin Hasani, Mathias Lechner, Yutong Ban, Chuang Gan, Daniela Rus
SmoothQuant: Accurate and Efficient Post-Training Quantization for Large Language Models	Large language models (LLMs) show excellent performance but are compute- and memory-intensive. Quantization can reduce memory and accelerate inference. However, existing methods cannot maintain accuracy and hardware efficiency at the same time. We propose SmoothQuant, a training-free, accuracy-preserving, and general-purpose post-training quantization (PTQ) solution to enable 8-bit weight, 8-bit activation (W8A8) quantization for LLMs. Based on the fact that weights are easy to quantize while activations are not, SmoothQuant smooths the activation outliers by offline migrating the quantization difficulty from activations to weights with a mathematically equivalent transformation. SmoothQuant enables an INT8 quantization of both weights and activations for all the matrix multiplications in LLMs, including OPT, BLOOM, GLM, MT-NLG, and LLaMA family. We demonstrate up to 1.56$\times$ speedup and 2$\times$ memory reduction for LLMs with negligible loss in accuracy. SmoothQuant enables serving 530B LLM within a single node. Our work offers a turn-key solution that reduces hardware costs and democratizes LLMs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xiao23c	Guangxuan Xiao, Ji Lin, Mickael Seznec, Hao Wu, Julien Demouth, Song Han
Communication-Efficient Federated Hypergradient Computation via Aggregated Iterative Differentiation	Federated bilevel optimization has attracted increasing attention due to emerging machine learning and communication applications. The biggest challenge lies in computing the gradient of the upper-level objective function (i.e., hypergradient) in the federated setting due to the nonlinear and distributed construction of a series of global Hessian matrices. In this paper, we propose a novel communication-efficient federated hypergradient estimator via aggregated iterative differentiation (AggITD). AggITD is simple to implement and significantly reduces the communication cost by conducting the federated hypergradient estimation and the lower-level optimization simultaneously. We show that the proposed AggITD-based algorithm achieves the same sample complexity as existing approximate implicit differentiation (AID)-based approaches with much fewer communication rounds in the presence of data heterogeneity. Our results also shed light on the great advantage of ITD over AID in the federated/distributed hypergradient estimation. This differs from the comparison in the non-distributed bilevel optimization, where ITD is less efficient than AID. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the great effectiveness and communication efficiency of the proposed method.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xiao23b	Peiyao Xiao, Kaiyi Ji
Random Shuffle Transformer for Image Restoration	Non-local interactions play a vital role in boosting performance for image restoration. However, local window Transformer has been preferred due to its efficiency for processing high-resolution images. The superiority in efficiency comes at the cost of sacrificing the ability to model non-local interactions. In this paper, we present that local window Transformer can also function as modeling non-local interactions. The counterintuitive function is based on the permutation-equivariance of self-attention. The basic principle is quite simple: by	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xiao23a	Jie Xiao, Xueyang Fu, Man Zhou, Hongjian Liu, Zheng-Jun Zha
UMD: Unsupervised Model Detection for X2X Backdoor Attacks	Backdoor (Trojan) attack is a common threat to deep neural networks, where samples from one or more source classes embedded with a backdoor trigger will be misclassified to adversarial target classes. Existing methods for detecting whether a classifier is backdoor attacked are mostly designed for attacks with a single adversarial target (e.g., all-to-one attack). To the best of our knowledge, without supervision, no existing methods can effectively address the more general X2X attack with an arbitrary number of source classes, each paired with an arbitrary target class. In this paper, we propose UMD, the first Unsupervised Model Detection method that effectively detects X2X backdoor attacks via a joint inference of the adversarial (source, target) class pairs. In particular, we first define a novel transferability statistic to measure and select a subset of putative backdoor class pairs based on a proposed clustering approach. Then, these selected class pairs are jointly assessed based on an aggregation of their reverse-engineered trigger size for detection inference, using a robust and unsupervised anomaly detector we proposed. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and Imagenette dataset, and show that our unsupervised UMD outperforms SOTA detectors (even with supervision) by 17%, 4%, and 8%, respectively, in terms of the detection accuracy against diverse X2X attacks. We also show the strong detection performance of UMD against several strong adaptive attacks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xiang23a	Zhen Xiang, Zidi Xiong, Bo Li
Fair and Optimal Classification via Post-Processing	To mitigate the bias exhibited by machine learning models, fairness criteria can be integrated into the training process to ensure fair treatment across all demographics, but it often comes at the expense of model performance. Understanding such tradeoffs, therefore, underlies the design of fair algorithms. To this end, this paper provides a complete characterization of the inherent tradeoff of demographic parity on classification problems, under the most general multi-group, multi-class, and noisy setting. Specifically, we show that the minimum error rate achievable by randomized and attribute-aware fair classifiers is given by the optimal value of a Wasserstein-barycenter problem. On the practical side, our findings lead to a simple post-processing algorithm that derives fair classifiers from score functions, which yields the optimal fair classifier when the score is Bayes optimal. We provide suboptimality analysis and sample complexity for our algorithm, and demonstrate its effectiveness on benchmark datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xian23b	Ruicheng Xian, Lang Yin, Han Zhao
Understanding Backdoor Attacks through the Adaptability Hypothesis	A poisoning backdoor attack is a rising security concern for deep learning. This type of attack can result in the backdoored model functioning normally most of the time but exhibiting abnormal behavior when presented with inputs containing the backdoor trigger, making it difficult to detect and prevent. In this work, we propose the adaptability hypothesis to understand when and why a backdoor attack works for general learning models, including deep neural networks, based on the theoretical investigation of classical kernel-based learning models. The adaptability hypothesis postulates that for an effective attack, the effect of incorporating a new dataset on the predictions of the original data points will be small, provided that the original data points are distant from the new dataset. Experiments on benchmark image datasets and state-of-the-art backdoor attacks for deep neural networks are conducted to corroborate the hypothesis. Our finding provides insight into the factors that affect the attack's effectiveness and has implications for the design of future attacks and defenses.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/xian23a	Xun Xian, Ganghua Wang, Jayanth Srinivasa, Ashish Kundu, Xuan Bi, Mingyi Hong, Jie Ding
Finite-Sample Analysis of Learning High-Dimensional Single ReLU Neuron	This paper considers the problem of learning single ReLU neuron with squared loss (a.k.a., ReLU regression) in the overparameterized regime, where the input dimension can exceed the number of samples. We analyze a Perceptron-type algorithm called GLM-tron [Kakade et al. 2011], and provide its dimension-free risk upper bounds for high-dimensional ReLU regression in both well-specified and misspecified settings. Our risk bounds recover several existing results as special cases. Moreover, in the well-specified setting, we also provide an instance-wise matching risk lower bound for GLM-tron. Our upper and lower risk bounds provide a sharp characterization of the high-dimensional ReLU regression problems that can be learned via GLM-tron. On the other hand, we provide some negative results for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for ReLU regression with symmetric Bernoulli data: if the model is well-specified, the excess risk of SGD is provably no better than that of GLM-tron ignoring constant factors, for each problem instance; and in the noiseless case, GLM-tron can achieve a small risk while SGD unavoidably suffers from a constant risk in expectation. These results together suggest that GLM-tron might be more preferable than SGD for high-dimensional ReLU regression.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23ab	Jingfeng Wu, Difan Zou, Zixiang Chen, Vladimir Braverman, Quanquan Gu, Sham M.

Differentially Private Episodic Reinforcement Learning with Heavy-tailed Rewards	In this paper we study the problem of (finite horizon tabular) Markov decision processes (MDPs) with heavy-tailed rewards under the constraint of differential privacy (DP). Compared with the previous studies for private reinforcement learning that typically assume rewards are sampled from some bounded or sub-Gaussian distributions to ensure DP, we consider the setting where reward distributions have only finite $(1+v)$-th moments with some $v \in (0,1]$. By resorting to robust mean estimators for rewards, we first propose two frameworks for heavy-tailed MDPs, i.e., one is for value iteration and another is for policy optimization. Under each framework, we consider both joint differential privacy (JDP) and local differential privacy (LDP) models. Based on our frameworks, we provide regret upper bounds for both JDP and LDP cases, and show that the moment of distributions and privacy budget have significant impact on regrets. Finally, we establish a lower bound of regret minimization for heavy-tailed MDPs in JDP model by reducing it to the instance-independent lower bound of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits in DP model. We also show the lower bound for the problem in LDP by adopting some private minimax methods. Our results reveal that there are fundamental differences between the problem of private RL with sub-Gaussian and that with heavy-tailed rewards.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23aa	Yulian Wu, Xingyu Zhou, Sayak Ray Chowdhury, Di Wang
Personalized Federated Learning under Mixture of Distributions	The recent trend towards Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has garnered significant attention as it allows for the training of models that are tailored to each client while maintaining data privacy. However, current PFL techniques primarily focus on modeling the conditional distribution heterogeneity (i.e. concept shift), which can result in suboptimal performance when the distribution of input data across clients diverges (i.e. covariate shift). Additionally, these techniques often lack the ability to adapt to unseen data, further limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach, FedGMM, which utilizes Gaussian mixture models (GMM) to effectively fit the input data distributions across diverse clients. The model parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood estimation utilizing a federated Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which is solved in closed form and does not assume gradient similarity. Furthermore, FedGMM possesses an additional advantage of adapting to new clients with minimal overhead, and it also enables uncertainty quantification. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both PFL classification and novel sample detection.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23z	Yue Wu, Shuaicheng Zhang, Wenchao Yu, Yanchi Liu, Quanquan Gu, Dawei Zhou, Haifeng Chen, Wei Cheng
dugMatting: Decomposed-Uncertainty-Guided Matting	Cutting out an object and estimating its opacity mask, known as image matting, is a key task in image and video editing. Due to the highly ill-posed issue, additional inputs, typically user-defined trimaps or scribbles, are usually needed to reduce the uncertainty. Although effective, it is either time consuming or only suitable for experienced users who know where to place the strokes. In this work, we propose a decomposed-uncertainty-guided matting (dugMatting) algorithm, which explores the explicitly decomposed uncertainties to efficiently and effectively improve the results. Basing on the characteristic of these uncertainties, the epistemic uncertainty is reduced in the process of guiding interaction (which introduces prior knowledge), while the aleatoric uncertainty is reduced in modeling data distribution (which introduces statistics for both data and possible noise). The proposed matting framework relieves the requirement for users to determine the interaction areas by using simple and efficient labeling. Extensively quantitative and qualitative results validate that the proposed method significantly improves the original matting algorithms in terms of both efficiency and efficacy.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23y	Jiawei Wu, Changqing Zhang, Zuoyong Li, Huazhu Fu, Xi Peng, Joey Tianyi Zhou
On the Training Instability of Shuffling SGD with Batch Normalization	"We uncover how SGD interacts with batch normalization and can exhibit undesirable training dynamics such as divergence. More precisely, we study how Single Shuffle (SS) and Random Reshuffle (RR)—two widely used variants of SGD—interact surprisingly differently in the presence of batch normalization: RR leads to much more stable evolution of training loss than SS. As a concrete example, for regression using a linear network with batch normalized inputs, we prove that SS and RR converge to distinct global optima that are ""distorted"" away from gradient descent. Thereafter, for classification we characterize conditions under which training divergence for SS and RR can, and cannot occur. We present explicit constructions to show how SS leads to distorted optima in regression and divergence for classification, whereas RR avoids both distortion and divergence. We validate our results empirically in realistic settings, and conclude that the separation between SS and RR used with batch normalization is relevant in practice."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23x	David Xing Wu, Chulhee Yun, Suvrit Sra
Discover and Cure: Concept-aware Mitigation of Spurious Correlation	Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations to make predictions, which hinders generalization beyond training environments. For instance, models that associate cats with bed backgrounds can fail to predict the existence of cats in other environments without beds. Mitigating spurious correlations is crucial in building trustworthy models. However, the existing works lack transparency to offer insights into the mitigation process. In this work, we propose an interpretable framework, Discover and Cure (DISC), to tackle the issue. With human-interpretable concepts, DISC iteratively 1) discovers unstable concepts across different environments as spurious attributes, then 2) intervenes on the training data using the discovered concepts to reduce spurious correlation. Across systematic experiments, DISC provides superior generalization ability and interpretability than the existing approaches. Specifically, it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on an object recognition task and a skin-lesion classification task by 7.5% and 9.6%, respectively. Additionally, we offer theoretical analysis and guarantees to understand the benefits of models trained by DISC. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Wuyxin/DISC.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23w	Shirley Wu, Mert Yuksekgonul, Linjun Zhang, James Zou
QuantumDARTS: Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search for Variational Quantum Algorithms	With the arrival of the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era and the fast development of machine learning, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) including Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and quantum neural network (QNN) have received increasing attention with wide potential applications in foreseeable near future. We study the problem of quantum architecture search (QAS) for VQA to automatically design parameterized quantum circuits (PQC). We devise a differentiable searching algorithm based on Gumbel-Softmax in contrast to peer methods that often require numerous circuit sampling and evaluation. Two versions of our algorithm are provided, namely macro search and micro search, where macro search directly searches for the whole circuit like other literature while the innovative micro search is able to infer the sub-circuit structure from a small-scale and then transfer that to a large-scale problem. We conduct intensive experiments on unweighted Max-Cut, ground state energy estimation, and image classification. The superior performance shows the efficiency and capability of macro search, which requires little prior knowledge. Moreover, the experiments on micro search show the potential of our algorithm for large-scale QAS problems.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23v	Wenjie Wu, Ge Yan, Xudong Lu, Kaisen Pan, Junchi Yan

$\pi$-Tuning: Transferring Multimodal Foundation Models with Optimal Multi-task Interpolation	Foundation models have achieved great advances in multi-task learning with a unified interface of unimodal and multimodal tasks. However, the potential of such multi-task learners has not been exploited during transfer learning. In this work, we present a universal parameter-efficient transfer learning method, termed Predict-Interpolate Tuning ($\pi$-Tuning), for vision, language, and vision-language tasks. It aggregates the parameters of lightweight task-specific experts learned from similar tasks to aid the target downstream task. The task similarities are predicted in a unified modality-independent space, yielding a scalable graph to demonstrate task relationships. $\pi$-Tuning has several appealing benefits. First, it flexibly explores both intra- and inter-modal transferability between similar tasks to improve the accuracy and robustness of transfer learning, especially in data-scarce scenarios. Second, it offers a systematical solution for transfer learning with multi-task prediction-and-then-interpolation, compatible with diverse types of parameter-efficient experts, such as prompt and adapter. Third, an extensive study of task-level mutual benefits on 14 unimodal and 6 multimodal datasets shows that $\pi$-Tuning surpasses fine-tuning and other parameter-efficient transfer learning methods both in full-shot and low-shot regimes. The task graph also enables an in-depth interpretable analysis of task transferability across modalities. The code will be available at https://github.com/TencentARC/pi-Tuning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23t	Chengyue Wu, Teng Wang, Yixiao Ge, Zeyu Lu, Ruisong Zhou, Ying Shan, Ping Luo
Distributional Offline Policy Evaluation with Predictive Error Guarantees	We study the problem of estimating the distribution of the return of a policy using an offline dataset that is not generated from the policy, i.e., distributional offline policy evaluation (OPE). We propose an algorithm called Fitted Likelihood Estimation (FLE), which conducts a sequence of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and has the flexibility of integrating any state-of-the-art probabilistic generative models as long as it can be trained via MLE. FLE can be used for both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon discounted settings where rewards can be multi-dimensional vectors. Our theoretical results show that for both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon discounted settings, FLE can learn distributions that are close to the ground truth under total variation distance and Wasserstein distance, respectively. Our theoretical results hold under the conditions that the offline data covers the test policy's traces and that the supervised learning MLE procedures succeed. Experimentally, we demonstrate the performance of FLE with two generative models, Gaussian mixture models and diffusion models. For the multi-dimensional reward setting, FLE with diffusion models is capable of estimating the complicated distribution of the return of a test policy.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23s	Runzhe Wu, Masatoshi Uehara, Wen Sun

Tight Data Access Bounds for Private Top-$k$ Selection	We study the top-$k$ selection problem under the differential privacy model: $m$ items are rated according to votes of a set of clients. We consider a setting in which algorithms can retrieve data via a sequence of accesses, each either a random access or a sorted access; the goal is to minimize the total number of data accesses. Our algorithm requires only $O(\sqrt{mk})$ expected accesses: to our knowledge, this is the first sublinear data-access upper bound for this problem. Our analysis also shows that the well-known exponential mechanism requires only $O(\sqrt{m})$ expected accesses. Accompanying this, we develop the first lower bounds for the problem, in three settings: only random accesses; only sorted accesses; a sequence of accesses of either kind. We show that, to avoid $\Omega(m)$ access cost, supporting	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23q	Hao Wu, Olga Ohrimenko, Anthony Wirth
Disentangled Multi-Fidelity Deep Bayesian Active Learning	To balance quality and cost, various domain areas of science and engineering run simulations at multiple levels of sophistication. Multi-fidelity active learning aims to learn a direct mapping from input parameters to simulation outputs at the highest fidelity by actively acquiring data from multiple fidelity levels. However, existing approaches based on Gaussian processes are hardly scalable to high-dimensional data. Deep learning-based methods often impose a hierarchical structure in hidden representations, which only supports passing information from low-fidelity to high-fidelity. These approaches can lead to the undesirable propagation of errors from low-fidelity representations to high-fidelity ones. We propose a novel framework called Disentangled Multi-fidelity Deep Bayesian Active Learning (D-MFDAL), which learns the surrogate models conditioned on the distribution of functions at multiple fidelities. On benchmark tasks of learning deep surrogates of partial differential equations including heat equation, Poisson's equation and fluid simulations, our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art in prediction accuracy and sample efficiency.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23p	Dongxia Wu, Ruijia Niu, Matteo Chinazzi, Yian Ma, Rose Yu
Masked Trajectory Models for Prediction, Representation, and Control	We introduce Masked Trajectory Models (MTM) as a generic abstraction for sequential decision making. MTM takes a trajectory, such as a state-action sequence, and aims to reconstruct the trajectory conditioned on random subsets of the same trajectory. By training with a highly randomized masking pattern, MTM learns versatile networks that can take on different roles or capabilities, by simply choosing appropriate masks at inference time. For example, the same MTM network can be used as a forward dynamics model, inverse dynamics model, or even an offline RL agent. Through extensive experiments in several continuous control tasks, we show that the same MTM network – i.e. same weights – can match or outperform specialized networks trained for the aforementioned capabilities. Additionally, we find that state representations learned by MTM can significantly accelerate the learning speed of traditional RL algorithms. Finally, in offline RL benchmarks, we find that MTM is competitive with specialized offline RL algorithms, despite MTM being a generic self-supervised learning method without any explicit RL components. Code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/mtm.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23o	Philipp Wu, Arjun Majumdar, Kevin Stone, Yixin Lin, Igor Mordatch, Pieter Abbeel, Aravind Rajeswaran
Delay-agnostic Asynchronous Coordinate Update Algorithm	We propose a delay-agnostic asynchronous coordinate update algorithm (DEGAS) for computing operator fixed points, with applications to asynchronous optimization. DEGAS includes novel asynchronous variants of ADMM and block-coordinate descent as special cases. We prove that DEGAS converges with both bounded and unbounded delays under delay-free parameter conditions. We also validate by theory and experiments that DEGAS adapts well to the actual delays. The effectiveness of DEGAS is demonstrated by numerical experiments on classification problems.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23n	Xuyang Wu, Changxin Liu, Sindri Magnússon, Mikael Johansson
Quantifying the Knowledge in GNNs for Reliable Distillation into MLPs	To bridge the gaps between topology-aware Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and inference-efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLPs), GLNN proposes to distill knowledge from a well-trained teacher GNN into a student MLP. Despite their great progress, comparatively little work has been done to explore the reliability of different knowledge points (nodes) in GNNs, especially their roles played during distillation. In this paper, we first quantify the knowledge reliability in GNN by measuring the invariance of their information entropy to noise perturbations, from which we observe that different knowledge points (1) show different distillation speeds (temporally); (2) are differentially distributed in the graph (spatially). To achieve reliable distillation, we propose an effective approach, namely Knowledge-inspired Reliable Distillation (KRD), that models the probability of each node being an informative and reliable knowledge point, based on which we sample a set of additional reliable knowledge points as supervision for training student MLPs. Extensive experiments show that KRD improves over the vanilla MLPs by 12.62% and outperforms its corresponding teacher GNNs by 2.16% averaged over 7 datasets and 3 GNN architectures.

Understanding Int4 Quantization for Language Models: Latency Speedup, Composability, and Failure Cases	Improving the deployment efficiency of transformer-based language models has been challenging given their high computation and memory cost. While INT8 quantization has recently been shown to be effective in reducing both the memory cost and latency while preserving model accuracy, it remains unclear whether we can leverage INT4 (which doubles peak hardware throughput) to achieve further latency improvement. In this study, we explore the feasibility of employing INT4 weight and activation (W4A4) quantization for language models. Our findings indicate that W4A4 quantization introduces no to negligible accuracy degradation for encoder-only and encoder-decoder models, but causes a significant accuracy drop for decoder-only models. To materialize the performance gain using W4A4, we develop a highly-optimized end-to-end W4A4 encoder inference pipeline supporting different quantization strategies. Our INT4 pipeline is $8.5\times$ faster for latency-oriented scenarios and up to $3\times$ for throughput-oriented scenarios compared to the inference of FP16, and improves the SOTA BERT INT8 performance from FasterTransformer by up to $1.7\times$. We provide insights into the failure cases when applying W4A4 to decoder-only models, and further explore the compatibility of INT4 quantization with other compression methods, like pruning and layer reduction.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23k	Xiaoxia Wu, Cheng Li, Reza Yazdani Aminabadi, Zhewei Yao, Yuxiong He
Rethinking Explaining Graph Neural Networks via Non-parametric Subgraph Matching	"The success of graph neural networks (GNNs) provokes the question about explainability: ""Which fraction of the input graph is the most determinant of the prediction?"" Particularly, parametric explainers prevail in existing approaches because of their more robust capability to decipher the black-box (i.e., target GNNs). In this paper, based on the observation that graphs typically share some common motif patterns, we propose a novel non-parametric subgraph matching framework, dubbed MatchExplainer, to explore explanatory subgraphs. It couples the target graph with other counterpart instances and identifies the most crucial joint substructure by minimizing the node corresponding-based distance. Moreover, we note that present graph sampling or node-dropping methods usually suffer from the false positive sampling problem. To alleviate this issue, we design a new augmentation paradigm named MatchDrop. It takes advantage of MatchExplainer to fix the most informative portion of the graph and merely operates graph augmentations on the rest less informative part. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our MatchExplainer by outperforming all state-of-the-art parametric baselines with significant margins. Results also demonstrate that MatchDrop is a general scheme to be equipped with GNNs for enhanced performance. The code is available at https://github.com/smiles724/MatchExplainer."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23j	Fang Wu, Siyuan Li, Xurui Jin, Yinghui Jiang, Dragomir Radev, Zhangming Niu, Stan Z. Li
Stable Estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects	Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) is crucial for identifying the variation of treatment effects across individuals or subgroups. Most existing methods estimate HTE by removing the confounding bias from imbalanced treatment assignments. However, these methods may produce unreliable estimates of treatment effects and potentially allocate suboptimal treatment arms for underrepresented populations. To improve the estimation accuracy of HTE for underrepresented populations, we propose a novel Stable CounterFactual Regression (StableCFR) to smooth the population distribution and upsample the underrepresented subpopulations, while balancing confounders between treatment and control groups. Specifically, StableCFR upsamples the underrepresented data using uniform sampling, where each disjoint subpopulation is weighted proportional to the Lebesgue measure of its support. Moreover, StableCFR balances covariates by using an epsilon-greedy matching approach. Empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our StableCFR on estimating HTE for underrepresented populations.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23i	Anpeng Wu, Kun Kuang, Ruoxuan Xiong, Bo Li, Fei Wu
Uncovering Adversarial Risks of Test-Time Adaptation	Recently, test-time adaptation (TTA) has been proposed as a promising solution for addressing distribution shifts. It allows a base model to adapt to an unforeseen distribution during inference by leveraging the information from the batch of (unlabeled) test data. However, we uncover a novel security vulnerability of TTA based on the insight that predictions on benign samples can be impacted by malicious samples in the same batch. To exploit this vulnerability, we propose Distribution Invading Attack (DIA), which injects a small fraction of malicious data into the test batch. DIA causes models using TTA to misclassify benign and unperturbed test data, providing an entirely new capability for adversaries that is infeasible in canonical machine learning pipelines. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate the high effectiveness of our attack on multiple benchmarks across six TTA methods. In response, we investigate two countermeasures to robustify the existing insecure TTA implementations, following the principle of security by design. Together, we hope our findings can make the community aware of the utility-security tradeoffs in deploying TTA and provide valuable insights for developing robust TTA approaches.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23h	Tong Wu, Feiran Jia, Xiangyu Qi, Jiachen T.

A Law of Robustness beyond Isoperimetry	We study the robust interpolation problem of arbitrary data distributions supported on a bounded space and propose a two-fold law of robustness. Robust interpolation refers to the problem of interpolating $n$ noisy training data points in $R^d$ by a Lipschitz function. Although this problem has been well understood when the samples are drawn from an isoperimetry distribution, much remains unknown concerning its performance under generic or even the worst-case distributions. We prove a Lipschitzness lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{n/p})$ of the interpolating neural network with $p$ parameters on arbitrary data distributions. With this result, we validate the law of robustness conjecture in prior work by Bubeck, Li and Nagaraj on two-layer neural networks with polynomial weights. We then extend our result to arbitrary interpolating approximators and prove a Lipschitzness lower bound $\Omega(n^{1/d})$ for robust interpolation. Our results demonstrate a two-fold law of robustness: a) we show the potential benefit of overparametrization for smooth data interpolation when $n=poly(d)$, and b) we disprove the potential existence of an $O(1)$-Lipschitz robust interpolating function when $n=\exp(\omega(d))$.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23g	Yihan Wu, Heng Huang, Hongyang Zhang
Solving High-Dimensional PDEs with Latent Spectral Models	Deep models have achieved impressive progress in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). A burgeoning paradigm is learning neural operators to approximate the input-output mappings of PDEs. While previous deep models have explored the multiscale architectures and various operator designs, they are limited to learning the operators as a whole in the coordinate space. In real physical science problems, PDEs are complex coupled equations with numerical solvers relying on discretization into high-dimensional coordinate space, which cannot be precisely approximated by a single operator nor efficiently learned due to the curse of dimensionality. We present Latent Spectral Models (LSM) toward an efficient and precise solver for high-dimensional PDEs. Going beyond the coordinate space, LSM enables an attention-based hierarchical projection network to reduce the high-dimensional data into a compact latent space in linear time. Inspired by classical spectral methods in numerical analysis, we design a neural spectral block to solve PDEs in the latent space that approximates complex input-output mappings via learning multiple basis operators, enjoying nice theoretical guarantees for convergence and approximation. Experimentally, LSM achieves consistent state-of-the-art and yields a relative gain of 11.5% averaged on seven benchmarks covering both solid and fluid physics.

Anchor Sampling for Federated Learning with Partial Client Participation	Compared with full client participation, partial client participation is a more practical scenario in federated learning, but it may amplify some challenges in federated learning, such as data heterogeneity. The lack of inactive clients' updates in partial client participation makes it more likely for the model aggregation to deviate from the aggregation based on full client participation. Training with large batches on individual clients is proposed to address data heterogeneity in general, but their effectiveness under partial client participation is not clear. Motivated by these challenges, we propose to develop a novel federated learning framework, referred to as FedAMD, for partial client participation. The core idea is anchor sampling, which separates partial participants into anchor and miner groups. Each client in the anchor group aims at the local bullseye with the gradient computation using a large batch. Guided by the bullseyes, clients in the miner group steer multiple near-optimal local updates using small batches and update the global model. By integrating the results of the two groups, FedAMD is able to accelerate the training process and improve the model performance. Measured by $\epsilon$-approximation and compared to the state-of-the-art methods, FedAMD achieves the convergence by up to $O(1/\epsilon)$ fewer communication rounds under non-convex objectives. Empirical studies on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of FedAMD and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm: Not only does it considerably save computation and communication costs, but also the test accuracy significantly improves.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23e	Feijie Wu, Song Guo, Zhihao Qu, Shiqi He, Ziming Liu, Jing Gao
Adaptive Compositional Continual Meta-Learning	This paper focuses on continual meta-learning, where few-shot tasks are heterogeneous and sequentially available. Recent works use a mixture model for meta-knowledge to deal with the heterogeneity. However, these methods suffer from parameter inefficiency caused by two reasons: (1) the underlying assumption of mutual exclusiveness among mixture components hinders sharing meta-knowledge across heterogeneous tasks. (2) they only allow increasing mixture components and cannot adaptively filter out redundant components. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Compositional Continual Meta-Learning (ACML) algorithm, which employs a compositional premise to associate a task with a subset of mixture components, allowing meta-knowledge sharing among heterogeneous tasks. Moreover, to adaptively adjust the number of mixture components, we propose a component sparsification method based on evidential theory to filter out redundant components. Experimental results show ACML outperforms strong baselines, showing the effectiveness of our compositional meta-knowledge, and confirming that ACML can adaptively learn meta-knowledge.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23d	Bin Wu, Jinyuan Fang, Xiangxiang Zeng, Shangsong Liang, Qiang Zhang
Effective Neural Topic Modeling with Embedding Clustering Regularization	Topic models have been prevalent for decades with various applications. However, existing topic models commonly suffer from the notorious topic collapsing: discovered topics semantically collapse towards each other, leading to highly repetitive topics, insufficient topic discovery, and damaged model interpretability. In this paper, we propose a new neural topic model, Embedding Clustering Regularization Topic Model (ECRTM). Besides the existing reconstruction error, we propose a novel Embedding Clustering Regularization (ECR), which forces each topic embedding to be the center of a separately aggregated word embedding cluster in the semantic space. This enables each produced topic to contain distinct word semantics, which alleviates topic collapsing. Regularized by ECR, our ECRTM generates diverse and coherent topics together with high-quality topic distributions of documents. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ECRTM effectively addresses the topic collapsing issue and consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in terms of topic quality, topic distributions of documents, and downstream classification tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23c	Xiaobao Wu, Xinshuai Dong, Thong Thanh Nguyen, Anh Tuan Luu
Causal Proxy Models for Concept-based Model Explanations	Explainability methods for NLP systems encounter a version of the fundamental problem of causal inference: for a given ground-truth input text, we never truly observe the counterfactual texts necessary for isolating the causal effects of model representations on outputs. In response, many explainability methods make no use of counterfactual texts, assuming they will be unavailable. In this paper, we show that robust causal explainability methods can be created using approximate counterfactuals, which can be written by humans to approximate a specific counterfactual or simply sampled using metadata-guided heuristics. The core of our proposal is the Causal Proxy Model (CPM).

SEGA: Structural Entropy Guided Anchor View for Graph Contrastive Learning	"In contrastive learning, the choice of ""view"" controls the information that the representation captures and influences the performance of the model. However, leading graph contrastive learning methods generally produce views via random corruption or learning, which could lead to the loss of essential information and alteration of semantic information. An anchor view that maintains the essential information of input graphs for contrastive learning has been hardly investigated. In this paper, based on the theory of graph information bottleneck, we deduce the definition of this anchor view; put differently, the anchor view with essential information of input graph is supposed to have the minimal structural uncertainty. Furthermore, guided by structural entropy, we implement the anchor view, termed SEGA, for graph contrastive learning. We extensively validate the proposed anchor view on various benchmarks regarding graph classification under unsupervised, semi-supervised, and transfer learning and achieve significant performance boosts compared to the state-of-the-art methods."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wu23a	Junran Wu, Xueyuan Chen, Bowen Shi, Shangzhe Li, Ke Xu

Our algorithm is based on approximate proximal-point iterations on the proxy combined with relatively few stochastic gradients from the objective. When the difference between the objective and the proxy is $\delta$-smooth, our algorithm guarantees convergence at a rate matching stochastic gradient descent on a $\delta$-smooth objective, which can lead to substantially better sample efficiency. Our algorithm has many potential applications in machine learning, and provides a principled means of leveraging synthetic data, physics simulators, mixed public and private data, and more.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/woodworth23a	Blake Woodworth, Konstantin Mishchenko, Francis Bach

Learning Deep Time-index Models for Time Series Forecasting	Deep learning has been actively applied to time series forecasting, leading to a deluge of new methods, belonging to the class of historical-value models. Yet, despite the attractive properties of time-index models, such as being able to model the continuous nature of underlying time series dynamics, little attention has been given to them. Indeed, while naive deep time-index models are far more expressive than the manually predefined function representations of classical time-index models, they are inadequate for forecasting, being unable to generalize to unseen time steps due to the lack of inductive bias. In this paper, we propose DeepTime, a meta-optimization framework to learn deep time-index models which overcome these limitations, yielding an efficient and accurate forecasting model. Extensive experiments on real world datasets in the long sequence time-series forecasting setting demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art methods, and is highly efficient.

The Blessing of Heterogeneity in Federated Q-Learning: Linear Speedup and Beyond	In this paper, we consider federated Q-learning, which aims to learn an optimal Q-function by periodically aggregating local Q-estimates trained on local data alone. Focusing on infinite-horizon tabular Markov decision processes, we provide sample complexity guarantees for both the synchronous and asynchronous variants of federated Q-learning. In both cases, our bounds exhibit a linear speedup with respect to the number of agents and sharper dependencies on other salient problem parameters. Moreover, existing approaches to federated Q-learning adopt an equally-weighted averaging of local Q-estimates, which can be highly sub-optimal in the asynchronous setting since the local trajectories can be highly heterogeneous due to different local behavior policies. Existing sample complexity scales inverse proportionally to the minimum entry of the stationary state-action occupancy distributions over all agents, requiring that every agent covers the entire state-action space. Instead, we propose a novel importance averaging algorithm, giving larger weights to more frequently visited state-action pairs. The improved sample complexity scales inverse proportionally to the minimum entry of the average stationary state-action occupancy distribution of all agents, thus only requiring the agents collectively cover the entire state-action space, unveiling the blessing of heterogeneity.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/woo23a	Jiin Woo, Gauri Joshi, Yuejie Chi
Uncertainty Estimation for Molecules: Desiderata and Methods	Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are promising surrogates for quantum mechanical calculations as they establish unprecedented low errors on collections of molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. Thanks to their fast inference times they promise to accelerate computational chemistry applications. Unfortunately, despite low in-distribution (ID) errors, such GNNs might be horribly wrong for out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Uncertainty estimation (UE) may aid in such situations by communicating the model's certainty about its prediction. Here, we take a closer look at the problem and identify six key desiderata for UE in molecular force fields, three 'physics-informed' and three 'application-focused' ones. To overview the field, we survey existing methods from the field of UE and analyze how they fit to the set desiderata. By our analysis, we conclude that none of the previous works satisfies all criteria. To fill this gap, we propose Localized Neural Kernel (LNK) a Gaussian Process (GP)-based extension to existing GNNs satisfying the desiderata. In our extensive experimental evaluation, we test four different UE with three different backbones across two datasets. In out-of-equilibrium detection, we find LNK yielding up to 2.5 and 2.1 times lower errors in terms of AUC-ROC score than dropout or evidential regression-based methods while maintaining high predictive performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wollschlager23a	Tom Wollschläger, Nicholas Gao, Bertrand Charpentier, Mohamed Amine Ketata, Stephan Günnemann
Marginalization is not Marginal: No Bad VAE Local Minima when Learning Optimal Sparse Representations	Although the variational autoencoder (VAE) represents a widely-used deep generative model, the underlying energy function when applied to continuous data remains poorly understood. In fact, most prior theoretical analysis has assumed a simplified affine decoder such that the model collapses to probabilistic PCA, a restricted regime whereby existing classical algorithms can also be trivially applied to guarantee globally optimal solutions. To push our understanding into more complex, practically-relevant settings, this paper instead adopts a deceptively sophisticated single-layer decoder that nonetheless allows the VAE to address the fundamental challenge of learning optimally sparse representations of continuous data originating from popular multiple-response regression models. In doing so, we can then examine VAE properties within the non-trivial context of solving difficult, NP-hard inverse problems. More specifically, we prove rigorous conditions which guarantee that any minimum of the VAE energy (local or global) will produce the optimally sparse latent representation, meaning zero reconstruction error using a minimal number of active latent dimensions. This is ultimately possible because VAE marginalization over the latent posterior selectively smooths away bad local minima as has been conjectured but not actually proven in prior work. We then discuss how equivalent-capacity deterministic autoencoders, even with appropriate sparsity-promoting regularization of the latent space, maintain bad local minima that do not correspond with such parsimonious representations. Overall, these results serve to elucidate key properties of the VAE loss surface relative to finding low-dimensional structure in data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wipf23a	David Wipf
Theoretical Behavior of XAI Methods in the Presence of Suppressor Variables	In recent years, the community of 'explainable artificial intelligence' (XAI) has created a vast body of methods to bridge a perceived gap between model 'complexity' and 'interpretability'. However, a concrete problem to be solved by XAI methods has not yet been formally stated. As a result, XAI methods are lacking theoretical and empirical evidence for the 'correctness' of their explanations, limiting their potential use for quality-control and transparency purposes. At the same time, Haufe et al. (2014) showed, using simple toy examples, that even standard interpretations of linear models can be highly misleading. Specifically, high importance may be attributed to so-called suppressor variables lacking any statistical relation to the prediction target. This behavior has been confirmed empirically for a large array of XAI methods in Wilming et al. (2022). Here, we go one step further by deriving analytical expressions for the behavior of a variety of popular XAI methods on a simple two-dimensional binary classification problem involving Gaussian class-conditional distributions. We show that the majority of the studied approaches will attribute non-zero importance to a non-class-related suppressor feature in the presence of correlated noise. This poses important limitations on the interpretations and conclusions that the outputs of these XAI methods can afford.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wilming23a	Rick Wilming, Leo Kieslich, Benedict Clark, Stefan Haufe
Approximate Stein Classes for Truncated Density Estimation	Estimating truncated density models is difficult, as these models have intractable normalising constants and hard to satisfy boundary conditions. Score matching can be adapted to solve the truncated density estimation problem, but requires a continuous weighting function which takes zero at the boundary and is positive elsewhere. Evaluation of such a weighting function (and its gradient) often requires a closed-form expression of the truncation boundary and finding a solution to a complicated optimisation problem. In this paper, we propose approximate Stein classes, which in turn leads to a relaxed Stein identity for truncated density estimation. We develop a novel discrepancy measure, truncated kernelised Stein discrepancy (TKSD), which does not require fixing a weighting function in advance, and can be evaluated using only samples on the boundary. We estimate a truncated density model by minimising the Lagrangian dual of TKSD. Finally, experiments show the accuracy of our method to be an improvement over previous works even without the explicit functional form of the boundary.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/williams23b	Daniel James Williams, Song Liu
Flexible Phase Dynamics for Bio-Plausible Contrastive Learning	Many learning algorithms used as normative models in neuroscience or as candidate approaches for learning on neuromorphic chips learn by contrasting one set of network states with another. These Contrastive Learning (CL) algorithms are traditionally implemented with rigid, temporally non-local, and periodic learning dynamics, that could limit the range of physical systems capable of harnessing CL. In this study, we build on recent work exploring how CL might be implemented by biological or neurmorphic systems and show that this form of learning can be made temporally local, and can still function even if many of the dynamical requirements of standard training procedures are relaxed. Thanks to a set of general theorems corroborated by numerical experiments across several CL models, our results provide theoretical foundations for the study and development of CL methods for biological and neuromorphic neural networks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/williams23a	Ezekiel Williams, Colin Bredenberg, Guillaume Lajoie
Scalable Set Encoding with Universal Mini-Batch Consistency and Unbiased Full Set Gradient Approximation	Recent work on mini-batch consistency (MBC) for set functions has brought attention to the need for sequentially processing and aggregating chunks of a partitioned set while guaranteeing the same output for all partitions. However, existing constraints on MBC architectures lead to models with limited expressive power. Additionally, prior work has not addressed how to deal with large sets during training when the full set gradient is required. To address these issues, we propose a Universally MBC (UMBC) class of set functions which can be used in conjunction with arbitrary non-MBC components while still satisfying MBC, enabling a wider range of function classes to be used in MBC settings. Furthermore, we propose an efficient MBC training algorithm which gives an unbiased approximation of the full set gradient and has a constant memory overhead for any set size for both train- and test-time. We conduct extensive experiments including image completion, text classification, unsupervised clustering, and cancer detection on high-resolution images to verify the efficiency and efficacy of our scalable set encoding framework.

Fully-Adaptive Composition in Differential Privacy	Composition is a key feature of differential privacy. Well-known advanced composition theorems allow one to query a private database quadratically more times than basic privacy composition would permit. However, these results require that the privacy parameters of all algorithms be fixed before interacting with the data. To address this, Rogers et al. introduced fully adaptive composition, wherein both algorithms and their privacy parameters can be selected adaptively. They defined two probabilistic objects to measure privacy in adaptive composition: privacy filters, which provide differential privacy guarantees for composed interactions, and privacy odometers, time-uniform bounds on privacy loss. There are substantial gaps between advanced composition and existing filters and odometers. First, existing filters place stronger assumptions on the algorithms being composed. Second, these odometers and filters suffer from large constants, making them impractical. We construct filters that match the rates of advanced composition, including constants, despite allowing for adaptively chosen privacy parameters. En route we also derive a privacy filter for approximate zCDP. We also construct several general families of odometers. These odometers match the tightness of advanced composition at an arbitrary, preselected point in time, or at all points in time simultaneously, up to a doubly-logarithmic factor. We obtain our results by leveraging advances in martingale concentration. In sum, we show that fully adaptive privacy is obtainable at almost no loss.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/whitehouse23a	Justin Whitehouse, Aaditya Ramdas, Ryan Rogers, Steven Wu
Open-VCLIP: Transforming CLIP to an Open-vocabulary Video Model via Interpolated Weight Optimization	Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated impressive zero-shot learning abilities for image understanding, yet limited effort has been made to investigate CLIP for zero-shot video recognition. We introduce Open-VCLIP, a simple yet effective approach that transforms CLIP into a strong zero-shot video classifier that can recognize unseen actions and events at test time. Our framework extends CLIP with minimal modifications to model spatial-temporal relationships in videos, making it a specialized video classifier, while striving for generalization. We formally show that training an Open-VCLIP is equivalent to continual learning with zero historical data. To address this problem, we propose Interpolated Weight Optimization, which utilizes the benefit of weight interpolation in both training and test time. We evaluate our method on three popular and challenging action recognition datasets following various zero-shot evaluation protocols and we demonstrate our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by clear margins. In particular, we achieve 87.9%, 58.3%, 81.1% zero-shot accuracy on UCF, HMDB and Kinetics-600 respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 8.3%, 7.8% and 12.2%.

Optimizing Mode Connectivity for Class Incremental Learning	Class incremental learning (CIL) is one of the most challenging scenarios in continual learning. Existing work mainly focuses on strategies like memory replay, regularization, or dynamic architecture but ignores a crucial aspect: mode connectivity. Recent studies have shown that different minima can be connected by a low-loss valley, and ensembling over the valley shows improved performance and robustness. Motivated by this, we try to investigate the connectivity in CIL and find that the high-loss ridge exists along the linear connection between two adjacent continual minima. To dodge the ridge, we propose parameter-saving OPtimizing Connectivity (OPC) based on Fourier series and gradient projection for finding the low-loss path between minima. The optimized path provides infinite low-loss solutions. We further propose EOPC to ensemble points within a local bent cylinder to improve performance on learned tasks. Our scheme can serve as a plug-in unit, extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K show consistent improvements when adapting EOPC to existing representative CIL methods.

A Conditional Normalizing Flow for Accelerated Multi-Coil MR Imaging	Accelerated magnetic resonance (MR) imaging attempts to reduce acquisition time by collecting data below the Nyquist rate. As an ill-posed inverse problem, many plausible solutions exist, yet the majority of deep learning approaches generate only a single solution. We instead focus on sampling from the posterior distribution, which provides more comprehensive information for downstream inference tasks. To do this, we design a novel conditional normalizing flow (CNF) that infers the signal component in the measurement operator's nullspace, which is later combined with measured data to form complete images. Using fastMRI brain and knee data, we demonstrate fast inference and accuracy that surpasses recent posterior sampling techniques for MRI.

Expectation-Complete Graph Representations with Homomorphisms	We investigate novel random graph embeddings that can be computed in expected polynomial time and that are able to distinguish all non-isomorphic graphs in expectation. Previous graph embeddings have limited expressiveness and either cannot distinguish all graphs or cannot be computed efficiently for every graph. To be able to approximate arbitrary functions on graphs, we are interested in efficient alternatives that become arbitrarily expressive with increasing resources. Our approach is based on Lovász' characterisation of graph isomorphism through an infinite dimensional vector of homomorphism counts. Our empirical evaluation shows competitive results on several benchmark graph learning tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/welke23a	Pascal Welke, Maximilian Thiessen, Fabian Jogl, Thomas Gärtner
Graphically Structured Diffusion Models	We introduce a framework for automatically defining and learning deep generative models with problem-specific structure. We tackle problem domains that are more traditionally solved by algorithms such as sorting, constraint satisfaction for Sudoku, and matrix factorization. Concretely, we train diffusion models with an architecture tailored to the problem specification. This problem specification should contain a graphical model describing relationships between variables, and often benefits from explicit representation of subcomputations. Permutation invariances can also be exploited. Across a diverse set of experiments we improve the scaling relationship between problem dimension and our model's performance, in terms of both training time and final accuracy.

Mitigating Memorization of Noisy Labels by Clipping the Model Prediction	In the presence of noisy labels, designing robust loss functions is critical for securing the generalization performance of deep neural networks. Cross Entropy (CE) loss has been shown to be not robust to noisy labels due to its unboundedness. To alleviate this issue, existing works typically design specialized robust losses with the symmetric condition, which usually lead to the underfitting issue. In this paper, our key idea is to induce a loss bound at the logit level, thus universally enhancing the noise robustness of existing losses. Specifically, we propose logit clipping (LogitClip), which clamps the norm of the logit vector to ensure that it is upper bounded by a constant. In this manner, CE loss equipped with our LogitClip method is effectively bounded, mitigating the overfitting to examples with noisy labels. Moreover, we present theoretical analyses to certify the noise-tolerant ability of LogitClip. Extensive experiments show that LogitClip not only significantly improves the noise robustness of CE loss, but also broadly enhances the generalization performance of popular robust losses.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wei23e	Hongxin Wei, Huiping Zhuang, Renchunzi Xie, Lei Feng, Gang Niu, Bo An, Yixuan Li
Set-membership Belief State-based Reinforcement Learning for POMDPs	Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant progress in areas such as Atari games and robotic control, where the agents have perfect sensing capabilities. However, in many real-world sequential decision-making tasks, the observation data could be noisy or incomplete due to the intrinsic low quality of the sensors or unexpected malfunctions; that is, the agent's perceptions are rarely perfect. The current POMDP RL methods, such as particle-based and Gaussian-based, can only provide a probability estimate of hidden states rather than certain belief regions, which may lead to inefficient and even wrong decision-making. This paper proposes a novel algorithm called Set-membership Belief state-based Reinforcement Learning (SBRL), which consists of two parts: a Set-membership Belief state learning Model (SBM) for learning bounded belief state sets and an RL controller for making decisions based on SBM. We prove that our belief estimation method can provide a series of belief state sets that always contain the true states under the unknown-but-bounded (UBB) noise. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on a collection of benchmark tasks, and the results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wei23d	Wei Wei, Lijun Zhang, Lin Li, Huizhong Song, Jiye Liang
Boosting Graph Contrastive Learning via Graph Contrastive Saliency	Graph augmentation plays a crucial role in achieving good generalization for contrastive graph self-supervised learning. However, mainstream Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) often favors random graph augmentations, by relying on random node dropout or edge perturbation on graphs. Random augmentations may inevitably lead to semantic information corruption during the training, and force the network to mistakenly focus on semantically irrelevant environmental background structures. To address these limitations and to improve generalization, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework for GCL, which can adaptively screen the semantic-related substructure in graphs by capitalizing on the proposed gradient-based Graph Contrastive Saliency (GCS). The goal is to identify the most semantically discriminative structures of a graph via contrastive learning, such that we can generate semantically meaningful augmentations by leveraging on saliency. Empirical evidence on 16 benchmark datasets demonstrates the exclusive merits of the GCS-based framework. We also provide rigorous theoretical justification for GCS's robustness properties.

NTK-approximating MLP Fusion for Efficient Language Model Fine-tuning	Fine-tuning a pre-trained language model (PLM) emerges as the predominant strategy in many natural language processing applications. However, even fine-tuning the PLMs and doing inference are expensive, especially on edge devices with low computing power. Some general approaches (e.g. quantization and distillation) have been widely studied to reduce the compute/memory of PLM fine-tuning, while very few one-shot compression techniques are explored. In this paper, we investigate the neural tangent kernel (NTK)–which reveals the gradient descent dynamics of neural networks–of the multilayer perceptrons (MLP) modules in a PLM and propose to coin a lightweight PLM through NTK-approximating MLP fusion. To achieve this, we reconsider the MLP as a bundle of sub-MLPs, and cluster them into a given number of centroids, which can then be restored as a compressed MLP and surprisingly shown to well approximate the NTK of the original PLM. Extensive experiments of PLM fine-tuning on both natural language understanding (NLU) and generation (NLG) tasks are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method MLP fusion.

A Universal Unbiased Method for Classification from Aggregate Observations	In conventional supervised classification, true labels are required for individual instances. However, it could be prohibitive to collect the true labels for individual instances, due to privacy concerns or unaffordable annotation costs. This motivates the study on classification from aggregate observations (CFAO), where the supervision is provided to groups of instances, instead of individual instances. CFAO is a generalized learning framework that contains various learning problems, such as multiple-instance learning and learning from label proportions. The goal of this paper is to present a novel universal method of CFAO, which holds an unbiased estimator of the classification risk for arbitrary losses—previous research failed to achieve this goal. Practically, our method works by weighing the importance of each instance and each label in the group, which provides purified supervision for the classifier to learn. Theoretically, our proposed method not only guarantees the risk consistency due to the unbiased risk estimator but also can be compatible with arbitrary losses. Extensive experiments on various problems of CFAO demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wei23a	Zixi Wei, Lei Feng, Bo Han, Tongliang Liu, Gang Niu, Xiaofeng Zhu, Heng Tao Shen
Global optimality for Euclidean CCCP under Riemannian convexity	We study geodesically convex (g-convex) problems that can be written as a difference of Euclidean convex functions. This structure arises in key applications such as matrix scaling, M- estimators of scatter matrices, and Brascamp-Lieb inequalities. In particular, we exploit this structure to make use of the Convex-Concave Procedure (CCCP), which helps us bypass potentially expensive Riemannian operations and leads to very competitive solvers. Importantly, unlike existing theory for CCCP that ensures convergence to stationary points, we exploit the overall g-convexity structure and provide iteration complexity results for global optimality. We illustrate our results by specializing them to a few concrete optimization problems that have been previously studied in the machine learning literature. We hope our work spurs the study of mixed Euclidean-Riemannian optimization algorithms.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/weber23a	Melanie Weber, Suvrit Sra
Nonparametric Extensions of Randomized Response for Private Confidence Sets	"This work derives methods for performing nonparametric, nonasymptotic statistical inference for population means under the constraint of local differential privacy (LDP). Given bounded observations $(X_1, …, X_n)$ with mean $\mu^\star$ that are privatized into $(Z_1, …, Z_n)$, we present confidence intervals (CI) and time-uniform confidence sequences (CS) for $\mu^\star$ when only given access to the privatized data. To achieve this, we introduce a nonparametric and sequentially interactive generalization of Warner's famous ""randomized response"" mechanism, satisfying LDP for arbitrary bounded random variables, and then provide CIs and CSs for their means given access to the resulting privatized observations. For example, our results yield private analogues of Hoeffding's inequality in both fixed-time and time-uniform regimes. We extend these Hoeffding-type CSs to capture time-varying (non-stationary) means, and conclude by illustrating how these methods can be used to conduct private online A/B tests."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/waudby-smith23a	Ian Waudby-Smith, Steven Wu, Aaditya Ramdas
On Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in Heterogeneous Causal Graphs	Heterogeneity and comorbidity are two interwoven challenges associated with various healthcare problems that greatly hampered research on developing effective treatment and understanding of the underlying neurobiological mechanism. Very few studies have been conducted to investigate heterogeneous causal effects (HCEs) in graphical contexts due to the lack of statistical methods. To characterize this heterogeneity, we first conceptualize heterogeneous causal graphs (HCGs) by generalizing the causal graphical model with confounder-based interactions and multiple mediators. Such confounders with an interaction with the treatment are known as moderators. This allows us to flexibly produce HCGs given different moderators and explicitly characterize HCEs from the treatment or potential mediators on the outcome. We establish the theoretical forms of HCEs and derive their properties at the individual level in both linear and nonlinear models. An interactive structural learning is developed to estimate the complex HCGs and HCEs with confidence intervals provided. Our method is empirically justified by extensive simulations and its practical usefulness is illustrated by exploring causality among psychiatric disorders for trauma survivors. Code implementing the proposed algorithm is open-source and publicly available at: https://github.com/richard-watson/ISL.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/watson23a	Richard A Watson, Hengrui Cai, Xinming An, Samuel Mclean, Rui Song
PPG Reloaded: An Empirical Study on What Matters in Phasic Policy Gradient	In model-free reinforcement learning, recent methods based on a phasic policy gradient (PPG) framework have shown impressive improvements in sample efficiency and zero-shot generalization on the challenging Procgen benchmark. In PPG, two design choices are believed to be the key contributing factors to its superior performance over PPO: the high level of value sample reuse and the low frequency of feature distillation. However, through an extensive empirical study, we unveil that policy regularization and data diversity are what actually matters. In particular, we can achieve the same level of performance with low value sample reuse and frequent feature distillation, as long as the policy regularization strength and data diversity are preserved. In addition, we can maintain the high performance of PPG while reducing the computational cost to a similar level as PPO. Our comprehensive study covers all 16 Procgen games in both sample efficiency and generalization setups. We hope it can advance the understanding of PPG and provide insights for future works.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23aw	Kaixin Wang, Daquan Zhou, Jiashi Feng, Shie Mannor
Reachability-Aware Laplacian Representation in Reinforcement Learning	In Reinforcement Learning (RL), Laplacian Representation (LapRep) is a task-agnostic state representation that encodes the geometry of the environment. A desirable property of LapRep stated in prior works is that the Euclidean distance in the LapRep space roughly reflects the reachability between states, which motivates the usage of this distance for reward shaping. However, we find that LapRep does not necessarily have this property in general: two states having a small distance under LapRep can actually be far away in the environment. Such a mismatch would impede the learning process in reward shaping. To fix this issue, we introduce a Reachability-Aware Laplacian Representation (RA-LapRep), by properly scaling each dimension of LapRep. Despite the simplicity, we demonstrate that RA-LapRep can better capture the inter-state reachability as compared to LapRep, through both theoretical explanations and experimental results. Additionally, we show that this improvement yields a significant boost in reward shaping performance and benefits bottleneck state discovery.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23av	Kaixin Wang, Kuangqi Zhou, Jiashi Feng, Bryan Hooi, Xinchao Wang
Offline Meta Reinforcement Learning with In-Distribution Online Adaptation	Recent offline meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) methods typically utilize task-dependent behavior policies (e.g., training RL agents on each individual task) to collect a multi-task dataset. However, these methods always require extra information for fast adaptation, such as offline context for testing tasks. To address this problem, we first formally characterize a unique challenge in offline meta-RL: transition-reward distribution shift between offline datasets and online adaptation. Our theory finds that out-of-distribution adaptation episodes may lead to unreliable policy evaluation and that online adaptation with in-distribution episodes can ensure adaptation performance guarantee. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose a novel adaptation framework, called In-Distribution online Adaptation with uncertainty Quantification (IDAQ), which generates in-distribution context using a given uncertainty quantification and performs effective task belief inference to address new tasks. We find a return-based uncertainty quantification for IDAQ that performs effectively. Experiments show that IDAQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Meta-World ML1 benchmark compared to baselines with/without offline adaptation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23au	Jianhao Wang, Jin Zhang, Haozhe Jiang, Junyu Zhang, Liwei Wang, Chongjie Zhang
LinSATNet: The Positive Linear Satisfiability Neural Networks	Encoding constraints into neural networks is attractive. This paper studies how to introduce the popular positive linear satisfiability to neural networks. We propose the first differentiable satisfiability layer based on an extension of the classic Sinkhorn algorithm for jointly encoding multiple sets of marginal distributions. We further theoretically characterize the convergence property of the Sinkhorn algorithm for multiple marginals, and the underlying formulation is also derived. In contrast to the sequential decision e.g. reinforcement learning-based solvers, we showcase our technique in solving constrained (specifically satisfiability) problems by one-shot neural networks, including i) a neural routing solver learned without supervision of optimal solutions; ii) a partial graph matching network handling graphs with unmatchable outliers on both sides; iii) a predictive network for financial portfolios with continuous constraints. To our knowledge, there exists no one-shot neural solver for these scenarios when they are formulated as satisfiability problems.

Enforcing Hard Constraints with Soft Barriers: Safe Reinforcement Learning in Unknown Stochastic Environments	It is quite challenging to ensure the safety of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in an unknown and stochastic environment under hard constraints that require the system state not to reach certain specified unsafe regions. Many popular safe RL methods such as those based on the Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) paradigm formulate safety violations in a cost function and try to constrain the expectation of cumulative cost under a threshold. However, it is often difficult to effectively capture and enforce hard reachability-based safety constraints indirectly with such constraints on safety violation cost. In this work, we leverage the notion of barrier function to explicitly encode the hard safety chance constraints, and given that the environment is unknown, relax them to our design of	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23as	Yixuan Wang, Simon Sinong Zhan, Ruochen Jiao, Zhilu Wang, Wanxin Jin, Zhuoran Yang, Zhaoran Wang, Chao Huang, Qi Zhu
DualHSIC: HSIC-Bottleneck and Alignment for Continual Learning	Rehearsal-based approaches are a mainstay of continual learning (CL). They mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem by maintaining a small fixed-size buffer with a subset of data from past tasks. While most rehearsal-based approaches exploit the knowledge from buffered past data, little attention is paid to inter-task relationships and to critical task-specific and task-invariant knowledge. By appropriately leveraging inter-task relationships, we propose a novel CL method, named DualHSIC, to boost the performance of existing rehearsal-based methods in a simple yet effective way. DualHSIC consists of two complementary components that stem from the so-called Hilbert Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC): HSIC-Bottleneck for Rehearsal (HBR) lessens the inter-task interference and HSIC Alignment (HA) promotes task-invariant knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments show that DualHSIC can be seamlessly plugged into existing rehearsal-based methods for consistent performance improvements, outperforming recent state-of-the-art regularization-enhanced rehearsal methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23ar	Zifeng Wang, Zheng Zhan, Yifan Gong, Yucai Shao, Stratis Ioannidis, Yanzhi Wang, Jennifer Dy
Robustly Learning a Single Neuron via Sharpness	We study the problem of learning a single neuron with respect to the $L_2^2$-loss in the presence of adversarial label noise. We give an efficient algorithm that, for a broad family of activations including ReLUs, approximates the optimal $L_2^2$-error within a constant factor. Notably, our algorithm succeeds under much milder distributional assumptions compared to prior work. The key ingredient enabling our results is a novel connection to local error bounds from optimization theory.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23aq	Puqian Wang, Nikos Zarifis, Ilias Diakonikolas, Jelena Diakonikolas
Network Effects in Performative Prediction Games	This paper studies the multi-agent performative prediction (Multi-PP) games over multiplex networks. We consider a distributed learning setting where agents partially cooperate on an agent network, while during learning, the data samples drawn depend on the prediction models of the agent itself and neighboring agents on a population network. The dynamics of Multi-PP games is hence affected by the interplay between both networks. This paper concentrates on this Multi-PP game with the following contributions. Firstly, we analyze sufficient conditions for the existence of the performative stable equilibrium (PSE) and Nash equilibrium (NE) of the Multi-PP games. Secondly, we analyze the changes to the equilibrium induced by perturbed data distributions, and derive the closed-form solutions where the network topologies are explicit. Our results connect the existence of PSE/NE with strengths of agents' cooperation, and the changes of equilibrium solutions across agents with their node centrality, etc. Lastly, we show that a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based distributed learning procedure finds the PSE under the said sufficient condition. Numerical illustrations on the network effects in Multi-PP games corroborate our findings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23ap	Xiaolu Wang, Chung-Yiu Yau, Hoi To Wai
Learning to Bid in Repeated First-Price Auctions with Budgets	Budget management strategies in repeated auctions have received growing attention in online advertising markets. However, previous work on budget management in online bidding mainly focused on second-price auctions. The rapid shift from second-price auctions to first-price auctions for online ads in recent years has motivated the challenging question of how to bid in repeated first-price auctions while controlling budgets. In this work, we study the problem of learning in repeated first-price auctions with budgets. We design a dual-based algorithm that can achieve a near-optimal $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with full information feedback where the maximum competing bid is always revealed after each auction. We further consider the setting with one-sided information feedback where only the winning bid is revealed after each auction. We show that our modified algorithm can still achieve an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with mild assumptions on the bidder's value distribution. Finally, we complement the theoretical results with numerical experiments to confirm the effectiveness of our budget management policy.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23ao	Qian Wang, Zongjun Yang, Xiaotie Deng, Yuqing Kong
Live in the Moment: Learning Dynamics Model Adapted to Evolving Policy	Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) often achieves higher sample efficiency in practice than model-free RL by learning a dynamics model to generate samples for policy learning. Previous works learn a dynamics model that fits under the empirical state-action visitation distribution for all historical policies, i.e., the sample replay buffer. However, in this paper, we observe that fitting the dynamics model under the distribution for	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23an	Xiyao Wang, Wichayaporn Wongkamjan, Ruonan Jia, Furong Huang
Model-Free Robust Average-Reward Reinforcement Learning	Robust Markov decision processes (MDPs) address the challenge of model uncertainty by optimizing the worst-case performance over an uncertainty set of MDPs. In this paper, we focus on the robust average-reward MDPs under the model-free setting. We first theoretically characterize the structure of solutions to the robust average-reward Bellman equation, which is essential for our later convergence analysis. We then design two model-free algorithms, robust relative value iteration (RVI) TD and robust RVI Q-learning, and theoretically prove their convergence to the optimal solution. We provide several widely used uncertainty sets as examples, including those defined by the contamination model, total variation, Chi-squared divergence, Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and Wasserstein distance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23am	Yue Wang, Alvaro Velasquez, George K.

Optimal Goal-Reaching Reinforcement Learning via Quasimetric Learning	In goal-reaching reinforcement learning (RL), the optimal value function has a particular geometry, called quasimetrics structure. This paper introduces Quasimetric Reinforcement Learning (QRL), a new RL method that utilizes quasimetric models to learn optimal value functions. Distinct from prior approaches, the QRL objective is specifically designed for quasimetrics, and provides strong theoretical recovery guarantees. Empirically, we conduct thorough analyses on a discretized MountainCar environment, identifying properties of QRL and its advantages over alternatives. On offline and online goal-reaching benchmarks, QRL also demonstrates improved sample efficiency and performance, across both state-based and image-based observations.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23al	Tongzhou Wang, Antonio Torralba, Phillip Isola, Amy Zhang
Effective and Efficient Structural Inference with Reservoir Computing	In this paper, we present an effective and efficient structural inference approach by integrating a Reservoir Computing (RC) network into a Variational Auto-encoder-based (VAE-based) structural inference framework. With the help of Bi-level Optimization, the backbone VAE-based method follows the Information Bottleneck principle and infers a general adjacency matrix in its latent space; the RC net substitutes the partial role of the decoder and encourages the whole approach to perform further steps of gradient descent based on limited available data. The experimental results on various datasets including biological networks, simulated fMRI data, and physical simulations show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method for structural inference, either with much fewer trajectories or with much shorter trajectories compared with previous works.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23ak	Aoran Wang, Tsz Pan Tong, Jun Pang
GEAR: A GPU-Centric Experience Replay System for Large Reinforcement Learning Models	This paper introduces a distributed, GPU-centric experience replay system, GEAR, designed to perform scalable reinforcement learning (RL) with large sequence models (such as transformers). With such models, existing systems such as Reverb face considerable bottlenecks in memory, computation, and communication. GEAR, however, optimizes memory efficiency by enabling the memory resources on GPU servers (including host memory and device memory) to manage trajectory data. Furthermore, it facilitates decentralized GPU devices to expedite various trajectory selection strategies, circumventing computational bottlenecks. GEAR is equipped with GPU kernels capable of collecting trajectories using zero-copy access to host memory, along with remote-directed-memory access over InfiniBand, improving communication efficiency. Cluster experiments have shown that GEAR can achieve performance levels up to 6× greater than Reverb when training state-of-the-art large RL models.

A Robust Test for the Stationarity Assumption in Sequential Decision Making	Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful technique that allows an autonomous agent to learn an optimal policy to maximize the expected return. The optimality of various RL algorithms relies on the stationarity assumption, which requires time-invariant state transition and reward functions. However, deviations from stationarity over extended periods often occur in real-world applications like robotics control, health care and digital marketing, resulting in suboptimal policies learned under stationary assumptions. In this paper, we propose a model-based doubly robust procedure for testing the stationarity assumption and detecting change points in offline RL settings with certain degree of homogeneity. Our proposed testing procedure is robust to model misspecifications and can effectively control type-I error while achieving high statistical power, especially in high-dimensional settings. Extensive comparative simulations and a real-world interventional mobile health example illustrate the advantages of our method in detecting change points and optimizing long-term rewards in high-dimensional, non-stationary environments.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23ai	Jitao Wang, Chengchun Shi, Zhenke Wu
InfoDiffusion: Representation Learning Using Information Maximizing Diffusion Models	While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality samples, their latent variables typically lack semantic meaning and are not suitable for representation learning. Here, we propose InfoDiffusion, an algorithm that augments diffusion models with low-dimensional latent variables that capture high-level factors of variation in the data. InfoDiffusion relies on a learning objective regularized with the mutual information between observed and hidden variables, which improves latent space quality and prevents the latents from being ignored by expressive diffusion-based decoders. Empirically, we find that InfoDiffusion learns disentangled and human-interpretable latent representations that are competitive with state-of-the-art generative and contrastive methods, while retaining the high sample quality of diffusion models. Our method enables manipulating the attributes of generated images and has the potential to assist tasks that require exploring a learned latent space to generate quality samples, e.g., generative design.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23ah	Yingheng Wang, Yair Schiff, Aaron Gokaslan, Weishen Pan, Fei Wang, Christopher De Sa, Volodymyr Kuleshov
Estimating Possible Causal Effects with Latent Variables via Adjustment	Causal effect identification is a fundamental task in artificial intelligence. A most ideal scenario for causal effect identification is that there is a directed acyclic graph as a prior causal graph encoding the causal relations of all relevant variables. In real tasks, however, the prior causal graph is usually not available, and some relevant variables may be latent as well. With observational data, we can only learn a partial ancestral graph (PAG), which contains some indeterminate causal relations. Since many causal graphs can correspond to one PAG, they are possibly associated with different causal effects. The aim of this paper is to estimate these possible causal effects via covariate adjustment given a PAG. This task is challenging because the number of causal graphs corresponding to a PAG grows super-exponentially with the number of variables. We propose a new graphical characterization for possible adjustment sets, and based on this, we develop the first method to determine the set of possible causal effects that are consistent with the given PAG without enumerating any causal graphs. Our method can output the same set as the enumeration method with super-exponentially less complexity. Experiments validate the effectiveness and tremendous efficiency improvement of the proposed method.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23ag	Tian-Zuo Wang, Tian Qin, Zhi-Hua Zhou
Projected Tensor Power Method for Hypergraph Community Recovery	This paper investigates the problem of exact community recovery in the symmetric $d$-uniform $(d \geq 2)$ hypergraph stochastic block model ($d$-HSBM). In this model, a $d$-uniform hypergraph with $n$ nodes is generated by first partitioning the $n$ nodes into $K\geq 2$ equal-sized disjoint communities and then generating hyperedges with a probability that depends on the community memberships of $d$ nodes.

Polarity Is All You Need to Learn and Transfer Faster	Natural intelligences (NIs) thrive in a dynamic world - they learn quickly, sometimes with only a few samples. In contrast, artificial intelligences (AIs) typically learn with a prohibitive number of training samples and computational power. What design principle difference between NI and AI could contribute to such a discrepancy? Here, we investigate the role of weight polarity: development processes initialize NIs with advantageous polarity configurations; as NIs grow and learn, synapse magnitudes update, yet polarities are largely kept unchanged.

Better Diffusion Models Further Improve Adversarial Training	It has been recognized that the data generated by the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) improves adversarial training. After two years of rapid development in diffusion models, a question naturally arises: can better diffusion models further improve adversarial training? This paper gives an affirmative answer by employing the most recent diffusion model which has higher efficiency ($\sim 20$ sampling steps) and image quality (lower FID score) compared with DDPM. Our adversarially trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance on RobustBench using only generated data (no external datasets). Under the $\ell_\infty$-norm threat model with $\epsilon=8/255$, our models achieve $70.69\\%$ and $42.67\\%$ robust accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively, i.e. improving upon previous state-of-the-art models by $+4.58\\%$ and $+8.03\\%$. Under the $\ell_2$-norm threat model with $\epsilon=128/255$, our models achieve $84.86\\%$ on CIFAR-10 ($+4.44\\%$). These results also beat previous works that use external data. We also provide compelling results on the SVHN and TinyImageNet datasets.

Active Learning based Structural Inference	In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Active Learning based Structural Inference (ALaSI), to infer the existence of directed connections from observed agents' states over a time period in a dynamical system. With the help of deep active learning, ALaSI is competent in learning the representation of connections with a relatively small pool of prior knowledge. Moreover, based on information theory, the proposed inter- and out-of-scope message learning pipelines are remarkably beneficial to structural inference for large dynamical systems. We evaluate ALaSI on various large datasets including simulated systems and real-world networks, to demonstrate that ALaSI is able to outperform previous methods in precisely inferring the existence of connections in large systems under either supervised learning or unsupervised learning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23ac	Aoran Wang, Jun Pang
Deep Temporal Sets with Evidential Reinforced Attentions for Unique Behavioral Pattern Discovery	Machine learning-driven human behavior analysis is gaining attention in behavioral/mental healthcare, due to its potential to identify behavioral patterns that cannot be recognized by traditional assessments. Real-life applications, such as digital behavioral biomarker identification, often require the discovery of complex spatiotemporal patterns in multimodal data, which is largely under-explored. To fill this gap, we propose a novel model that integrates uniquely designed Deep Temporal Sets (DTS) with Evidential Reinforced Attentions (ERA). DTS captures complex temporal relationships in the input and generates a set-based representation, while ERA captures the policy network's uncertainty and conducts evidence-aware exploration to locate attentive regions in behavioral data. Using child-computer interaction data as a testing platform, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DTS-ERA in differentiating children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and typically developing children based on sequential multimodal visual and touch behaviors. Comparisons with baseline methods show that our model achieves superior performance and has the potential to provide objective, quantitative, and precise analysis of complex human behaviors.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23ab	Dingrong Wang, Deep Shankar Pandey, Krishna Prasad Neupane, Zhiwei Yu, Ervine Zheng, Zhi Zheng, Qi Yu
Data Efficient Neural Scaling Law via Model Reusing	The number of parameters in large transformers has been observed to grow exponentially. Despite notable performance improvements, concerns have been raised that such a growing model size will run out of data in the near future. As manifested in the neural scaling law, modern learning backbones are not data-efficient. To maintain the utility of the model capacity, training data should be increased proportionally. In this paper, we study the neural scaling law under the previously overlooked data scarcity regime, focusing on the more challenging situation where we need to train a gigantic model with a disproportionately limited supply of available training data. We find that the existing power laws underestimate the data inefficiency of large transformers. Their performance will drop significantly if the training set is insufficient. Fortunately, we discover another blessing - such a data-inefficient scaling law can be restored through a model reusing approach that warm-starts the training of a large model by initializing it using smaller models. Our empirical study shows that model reusing can effectively reproduce the power law under the data scarcity regime. When progressively applying model reusing to expand the model size, we also observe consistent performance improvement in large transformers. We release our code at: https://github.com/VITA-Group/Data-Efficient-Scaling.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23aa	Peihao Wang, Rameswar Panda, Zhangyang Wang
Curriculum Co-disentangled Representation Learning across Multiple Environments for Social Recommendation	There exist complex patterns behind the decision-making processes of different individuals across different environments. For instance, in a social recommender system, various user behaviors are driven by highly entangled latent factors from two environments, i.e., consuming environment where users consume items and social environment where users connect with each other. Uncovering the disentanglement of these latent factors for users can benefit in enhanced explainability and controllability for recommendation. However, in literature there has been no work on social recommendation capable of disentangling user representations across consuming and social environments. To solve this problem, we study co-disentangled representation learning across different environments via proposing the curriculum co-disentangled representation learning (CurCoDis) model to disentangle the hidden factors for users across both consuming and social environments. To co-disentangle joint representations for user-item consumption and user-user social graph simultaneously, we partition the social graph into equal-size sub-graphs with minimum number of edges being cut, and design a curriculum weighing strategy for subgraph training through measuring the complexity of subgraphs via Descartes' rule of signs. We further develop the prototype-routing optimization mechanism, which achieves co-disentanglement of user representations across consuming and social environments. Extensive experiments for social recommendation demonstrate that our proposed CurCoDis model can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods on several real-world datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23z	Xin Wang, Zirui Pan, Yuwei Zhou, Hong Chen, Chendi Ge, Wenwu Zhu

NP-SemiSeg: When Neural Processes meet Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation	Semi-supervised semantic segmentation involves assigning pixel-wise labels to unlabeled images at training time. This is useful in a wide range of real-world applications where collecting pixel-wise labels is not feasible in time or cost. Current approaches to semi-supervised semantic segmentation work by predicting pseudo-labels for each pixel from a class-wise probability distribution output by a model. If this predicted probability distribution is incorrect, however, it leads to poor segmentation results which can have knock-on consequences in safety critical systems, like medical images or self-driving cars. It is, therefore, important to understand what a model does not know, which is mainly achieved by uncertainty quantification. Recently, neural processes (NPs) have been explored in semi-supervised image classification, and they have been a computationally efficient and effective method for uncertainty quantification. In this work, we move one step forward by adapting NPs to semi-supervised semantic segmentation, resulting in a new model called NP-SemiSeg. We experimentally evaluated NP-SemiSeg on the public benchmarks PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes, with different training settings, and the results verify its effectiveness.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23x	Jianfeng Wang, Daniela Massiceti, Xiaolin Hu, Vladimir Pavlovic, Thomas Lukasiewicz
Tighter Information-Theoretic Generalization Bounds from Supersamples	"In this work, we present a variety of novel information-theoretic generalization bounds for learning algorithms, from the supersample setting of Steinke & Zakynthinou (2020)—the setting of the ""conditional mutual information"" framework. Our development exploits projecting the loss pair (obtained from a training instance and a testing instance) down to a single number and correlating loss values with a Rademacher sequence (and its shifted variants). The presented bounds include square-root bounds, fast-rate bounds, including those based on variance and sharpness, and bounds for interpolating algorithms etc. We show theoretically or empirically that these bounds are tighter than all information-theoretic bounds known to date on the same supersample setting."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23w	Ziqiao Wang, Yongyi Mao
Direct Parameterization of Lipschitz-Bounded Deep Networks	"This paper introduces a new parameterization of deep neural networks (both fully-connected and convolutional) with guaranteed $\ell^2$ Lipschitz bounds, i.e. limited sensitivity to input perturbations. The Lipschitz guarantees are equivalent to the tightest-known bounds based on certification via a semidefinite program (SDP). We provide a ""direct"" parameterization, i.e., a smooth mapping from $\mathbb R^N$ onto the set of weights satisfying the SDP-based bound. Moreover, our parameterization is complete, i.e. a neural network satisfies the SDP bound if and only if it can be represented via our parameterization. This enables training using standard gradient methods, without any inner approximation or computationally intensive tasks (e.g. projections or barrier terms) for the SDP constraint. The new parameterization can equivalently be thought of as either a new layer type (the"	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23v	Ruigang Wang, Ian Manchester
Magneto: A Foundation Transformer	"A big convergence of model architectures across language, vision, speech, and multimodal is emerging. However, under the same name ""Transformers"", the above areas use different implementations for better performance, e.g., Post-LayerNorm for BERT, and Pre-LayerNorm for GPT and vision Transformers. We call for the development of Foundation Transformer for true general-purpose modeling, which serves as a go-to architecture for various tasks and modalities with guaranteed training stability. In this work, we introduce a Transformer variant, named Magneto, to fulfill the goal. Specifically, we propose Sub-LayerNorm for good expressivity, and the initialization strategy theoretically derived from DeepNet for stable scaling up. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance and better stability than the de facto Transformer variants designed for various applications, including language modeling (i.e., BERT, and GPT), machine translation, vision pretraining (i.e., BEiT), speech recognition, and multimodal pretraining (i.e., BEiT-3)."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23u	Hongyu Wang, Shuming Ma, Shaohan Huang, Li Dong, Wenhui Wang, Zhiliang Peng, Yu Wu, Payal Bajaj, Saksham Singhal, Alon Benhaim, Barun Patra, Zhun Liu, Vishrav Chaudhary, Xia Song, Furu Wei
CocktailSGD: Fine-tuning Foundation Models over 500Mbps Networks	Distributed training of foundation models, especially large language models (LLMs), is communication-intensive and so has heavily relied on centralized data centers with fast interconnects. Can we train on slow networks and unlock the potential of decentralized infrastructure for foundation models? In this paper, we propose CocktailSGD, a novel communication-efficient training framework that combines three distinct compression techniques – random sparsification, top-K sparsification, and quantization – to achieve much greater compression than each individual technique alone. We justify the benefit of such a hybrid approach through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we show that CocktailSGD achieves up to 117$\times$ compression in fine-tuning LLMs up to 20 billion parameters without hurting convergence. On a 500Mbps network, CocktailSGD only incurs $\sim$1.2$\times$ slowdown compared with data center networks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23t	Jue Wang, Yucheng Lu, Binhang Yuan, Beidi Chen, Percy Liang, Christopher De Sa, Christopher Re, Ce Zhang
DIVISION: Memory Efficient Training via Dual Activation Precision	Activation compressed training provides a solution towards reducing the memory cost of training deep neural networks (DNNs). However, state-of-the-art work combines a search of quantization bit-width with the training, which makes the procedure complicated and less transparent. To this end, we propose a simple and effective method to compress DNN training. Our method is motivated by an instructive observation: DNN backward propagation mainly utilizes the low-frequency component (LFC) of the activation maps, while the majority of memory is for caching the high-frequency component (HFC) during the training. This indicates the HFC of activation maps is highly redundant and compressible, which inspires our proposed Dual Activation Precision (DIVISION). During the training, DIVISION preserves a high-precision copy of LFC and compresses the HFC into a light-weight copy with low numerical precision. This can significantly reduce the memory cost while maintaining a competitive model accuracy. Experiment results show DIVISION has better comprehensive performance than state-of-the-art methods, including over 10x compression of activation maps and competitive training throughput, without loss of model accuracy.

Slot-VAE: Object-Centric Scene Generation with Slot Attention	Slot attention has shown remarkable object-centric representation learning performance in computer vision tasks without requiring any supervision. Despite its object-centric binding ability brought by compositional modelling, as a deterministic module, slot attention lacks the ability to generate novel scenes. In this paper, we propose the Slot-VAE, a generative model that integrates slot attention with the hierarchical VAE framework for object-centric structured scene generation. For each image, the model simultaneously infers a global scene representation to capture high-level scene structure and object-centric slot representations to embed individual object components. During generation, slot representations are generated from the global scene representation to ensure coherent scene structures. Our extensive evaluation of the scene generation ability indicates that Slot-VAE outperforms slot representation-based generative baselines in terms of sample quality and scene structure accuracy.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23r	Yanbo Wang, Letao Liu, Justin Dauwels

Learning Belief Representations for Partially Observable Deep RL	Many important real-world Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems involve partial observability and require policies with memory. Unfortunately, standard deep RL algorithms for partially observable settings typically condition on the full history of interactions and are notoriously difficult to train. We propose a novel deep, partially observable RL algorithm based on modelling belief states — a technique typically used when solving tabular POMDPs, but that has traditionally been difficult to apply to more complex environments. Our approach simplifies policy learning by leveraging state information at training time, that may not be available at deployment time. We do so in two ways: first, we decouple belief state modelling (via unsupervised learning) from policy optimization (via RL); and second, we propose a representation learning approach to capture a compact set of reward-relevant features of the state. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on partially observable domains requiring information seeking and long-term memory.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23p	Andrew Wang, Andrew C Li, Toryn Q.

A/B Testing in Network Data with Covariate-Adaptive Randomization	Users linked together through a network often tend to have similar behaviors. This phenomenon is usually known as network interaction. Users' characteristics, the covariates, are often correlated with their outcomes. Therefore, one should incorporate both the covariates and the network information in a carefully designed randomization to improve the estimation of the average treatment effect (ATE) in network A/B testing. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive procedure to balance both the network and the covariates. We show that the imbalance measures with respect to the covariates and the network are $O_p(1)$. We also demonstrate the relationships between the improved balances and the increased efficiency in terms of the mean square error (MSE). Numerical studies demonstrate the advanced performance of the proposed procedure regarding the greater comparability of the treatment groups and the reduction of MSE for estimating the ATE.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23o	Jialu Wang, Ping Li, Feifang Hu
FedHPO-Bench: A Benchmark Suite for Federated Hyperparameter Optimization	Research in the field of hyperparameter optimization (HPO) has been greatly accelerated by existing HPO benchmarks. Nonetheless, existing efforts in benchmarking all focus on HPO for traditional learning paradigms while ignoring federated learning (FL), a promising paradigm for collaboratively learning models from dispersed data. In this paper, we first identify some uniqueness of federated hyperparameter optimization (FedHPO) from various aspects, showing that existing HPO benchmarks no longer satisfy the need to study FedHPO methods. To facilitate the research of FedHPO, we propose and implement a benchmark suite FedHPO-Bench that incorporates comprehensive FedHPO problems, enables flexible customization of the function evaluations, and eases continuing extensions. We conduct extensive experiments based on FedHPO-Bench to provide the community with more insights into FedHPO.

Near-Minimax-Optimal Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning with CVaR	In this paper, we study risk-sensitive Reinforcement Learning (RL), focusing on the objective of Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) with risk tolerance $\tau$. Starting with multi-arm bandits (MABs), we show the minimax CVaR regret rate is $\Omega(\sqrt{\tau^{-1}AK})$, where $A$ is the number of actions and $K$ is the number of episodes, and that it is achieved by an Upper Confidence Bound algorithm with a novel Bernstein bonus. For online RL in tabular Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), we show a minimax regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{\tau^{-1}SAK})$ (with normalized cumulative rewards), where $S$ is the number of states, and we propose a novel bonus-driven Value Iteration procedure. We show that our algorithm achieves the optimal regret of $\widetilde O(\sqrt{\tau^{-1}SAK})$ under a continuity assumption and in general attains a near-optimal regret of $\widetilde O(\tau^{-1}\sqrt{SAK})$, which is minimax-optimal for constant $\tau$. This improves on the best available bounds. By discretizing rewards appropriately, our algorithms are computationally efficient.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23m	Kaiwen Wang, Nathan Kallus, Wen Sun
Generalized Polyak Step Size for First Order Optimization with Momentum	In machine learning applications, it is well known that carefully designed learning rate (step size) schedules can significantly improve the convergence of commonly used first-order optimization algorithms. Therefore how to set step size adaptively becomes an important research question. A popular and effective method is the Polyak step size, which sets step size adaptively for gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent without the need to estimate the smoothness parameter of the objective function. However, there has not been a principled way to generalize the Polyak step size for algorithms with momentum accelerations. This paper presents a general framework to set the learning rate adaptively for first-order optimization methods with momentum, motivated by the derivation of Polyak step size. It is shown that the resulting techniques are much less sensitive to the choice of momentum parameter and may avoid the oscillation of the heavy-ball method on ill-conditioned problems. These adaptive step sizes are further extended to the stochastic settings, which are attractive choices for stochastic gradient descent with momentum. Our methods are demonstrated to be more effective for stochastic gradient methods than prior adaptive step size algorithms in large-scale machine learning tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23l	Xiaoyu Wang, Mikael Johansson, Tong Zhang
CircuitNet: A Generic Neural Network to Realize Universal Circuit Motif Modeling	The successes of artificial neural networks (ANNs) are largely attributed to mimicking the human brain structures. Recent advances in neuroscience revealed that neurons interact with each other through various kinds of connectivity patterns to process information, in which the common connectivity patterns are also called circuit motifs. However, many existing ANNs can only model one or two circuit motifs in their architectures, so that their performance may drastically vary among different types of machine learning tasks. In this paper, we propose a new type of neural network inspired by the architectures of neuronal circuits, namely Circuit Neural Network (CircuitNet). In CircuitNet, a group of densely connected neurons, namely circuit motif unit (CMU), form the basic unit of the network, which is capable of modeling universal circuit motifs by adjusting the weights within the CMUs. Compared with traditional feed-forward networks, CircuitNet has the ability to model more types of neuron connections such as feed-back and lateral motifs. Inspired by the locally dense and globally sparse structure of the human brain, several iterations of signal transmission among different CMUs are achieved by sparse connections through the input ports and output ports of different CMUs. Experiments have demonstrated that CircuitNet can outperform popular neural network architectures in function approximation, reinforcement learning, image classification, and time series forecasting tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23k	Yansen Wang, Xinyang Jiang, Kan Ren, Caihua Shan, Xufang Luo, Dongqi Han, Kaitao Song, Yifei Shen, Dongsheng Li
Adaptive Smoothing Gradient Learning for Spiking Neural Networks	Spiking neural networks (SNNs) with biologically inspired spatio-temporal dynamics demonstrate superior energy efficiency on neuromorphic architectures. Error backpropagation in SNNs is prohibited by the all-or-none nature of spikes. The existing solution circumvents this problem by a relaxation on the gradient calculation using a continuous function with a constant relaxation de- gree, so-called surrogate gradient learning. Nevertheless, such a solution introduces additional smoothing error on spike firing which leads to the gradients being estimated inaccurately. Thus, how to adaptively adjust the relaxation degree and eliminate smoothing error progressively is crucial. Here, we propose a methodology such that training a prototype neural network will evolve into training an SNN gradually by fusing the learnable relaxation degree into the network with random spike noise. In this way, the network learns adaptively the accurate gradients of loss landscape in SNNs. The theoretical analysis further shows optimization on such a noisy network could be evolved into optimization on the embedded SNN with shared weights progressively. Moreover, The experiments on static images, dynamic event streams, speech, and instrumental sounds show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all the datasets with remarkable robustness on different relaxation degrees.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23j	Ziming Wang, Runhao Jiang, Shuang Lian, Rui Yan, Huajin Tang
Policy Gradient in Robust MDPs with Global Convergence Guarantee	Robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs) provide a promising framework for computing reliable policies in the face of model errors. Many successful reinforcement learning algorithms build on variations of policy-gradient methods, but adapting these methods to RMDPs has been challenging. As a result, the applicability of RMDPs to large, practical domains remains limited. This paper proposes a new Double-Loop Robust Policy Gradient (DRPG), the first generic policy gradient method for RMDPs. In contrast with prior robust policy gradient algorithms, DRPG monotonically reduces approximation errors to guarantee convergence to a globally optimal policy in tabular RMDPs. We introduce a novel parametric transition kernel and solve the inner loop robust policy via a gradient-based method. Finally, our numerical results demonstrate the utility of our new algorithm and confirm its global convergence properties.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23i	Qiuhao Wang, Chin Pang Ho, Marek Petrik
On Regularization and Inference with Label Constraints	Prior knowledge and symbolic rules in machine learning are often expressed in the form of label constraints, especially in structured prediction problems.

Adversarial Policies Beat Superhuman Go AIs	We attack the state-of-the-art Go-playing AI system KataGo by training adversarial policies against it, achieving a $>$97% win rate against KataGo running at superhuman settings. Our adversaries do not win by playing Go well. Instead, they trick KataGo into making serious blunders. Our attack transfers zero-shot to other superhuman Go-playing AIs, and is comprehensible to the extent that human experts can implement it without algorithmic assistance to consistently beat superhuman AIs. The core vulnerability uncovered by our attack persists even in KataGo agents adversarially trained to defend against our attack. Our results demonstrate that even superhuman AI systems may harbor surprising failure modes. Example games are available https://goattack.far.ai/.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23g	Tony Tong Wang, Adam Gleave, Tom Tseng, Kellin Pelrine, Nora Belrose, Joseph Miller, Michael D Dennis, Yawen Duan, Viktor Pogrebniak, Sergey Levine, Stuart Russell
PreNAS: Preferred One-Shot Learning Towards Efficient Neural Architecture Search	The wide application of pre-trained models is driving the trend of once-for-all training in one-shot neural architecture search (NAS). However, training within a huge sample space damages the performance of individual subnets and requires much computation to search for a optimal model. In this paper, we present PreNAS, a search-free NAS approach that accentuates target models in one-shot training. Specifically, the sample space is dramatically reduced in advance by a zero-cost selector, and weight-sharing one-shot training is performed on the preferred architectures to alleviate update conflicts. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that PreNAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art one-shot NAS competitors for both Vision Transformer and convolutional architectures, and importantly, enables instant specialization with zero search cost.

A Closer Look at Self-Supervised Lightweight Vision Transformers	Self-supervised learning on large-scale Vision Transformers (ViTs) as pre-training methods has achieved promising downstream performance. Yet, how much these pre-training paradigms promote lightweight ViTs' performance is considerably less studied. In this work, we develop and benchmark several self-supervised pre-training methods on image classification tasks and some downstream dense prediction tasks. We surprisingly find that if proper pre-training is adopted, even vanilla lightweight ViTs show comparable performance to previous SOTA networks with delicate architecture design. It breaks the recently popular conception that vanilla ViTs are not suitable for vision tasks in lightweight regimes. We also point out some defects of such pre-training, e.g., failing to benefit from large-scale pre-training data and showing inferior performance on data-insufficient downstream tasks. Furthermore, we analyze and clearly show the effect of such pre-training by analyzing the properties of the layer representation and attention maps for related models. Finally, based on the above analyses, a distillation strategy during pre-training is developed, which leads to further downstream performance improvement for MAE-based pre-training. Code is available at https://github.com/wangsr126/mae-lite.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23e	Shaoru Wang, Jin Gao, Zeming Li, Xiaoqin Zhang, Weiming Hu
From Hypergraph Energy Functions to Hypergraph Neural Networks	Hypergraphs are a powerful abstraction for representing higher-order interactions between entities of interest. To exploit these relationships in making downstream predictions, a variety of hypergraph neural network architectures have recently been proposed, in large part building upon precursors from the more traditional graph neural network (GNN) literature. Somewhat differently, in this paper we begin by presenting an expressive family of parameterized, hypergraph-regularized energy functions. We then demonstrate how minimizers of these energies effectively serve as node embeddings that, when paired with a parameterized classifier, can be trained end-to-end via a supervised bilevel optimization process. Later, we draw parallels between the implicit architecture of the predictive models emerging from the proposed bilevel hypergraph optimization, and existing GNN architectures in common use. Empirically, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results on various hypergraph node classification benchmarks.

Tilted Sparse Additive Models	Additive models have been burgeoning in data analysis due to their flexible representation and desirable interpretability. However, most existing approaches are constructed under empirical risk minimization (ERM), and thus perform poorly in situations where average performance is not a suitable criterion for the problems of interest, e.g., data with complex non-Gaussian noise, imbalanced labels or both of them. In this paper, a novel class of sparse additive models is proposed under tilted empirical risk minimization (TERM), which addresses the deficiencies in ERM by imposing tilted impact on individual losses, and is flexibly capable of achieving a variety of learning objectives, e.g., variable selection, robust estimation, imbalanced classification and multiobjective learning. On the theoretical side, a learning theory analysis which is centered around the generalization bound and function approximation error bound (under some specific data distributions) is conducted rigorously. On the practical side, an accelerated optimization algorithm is designed by integrating Prox-SVRG and random Fourier acceleration technique. The empirical assessments verify the competitive performance of our approach on both synthetic and real data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23c	Yingjie Wang, Hong Chen, Weifeng Liu, Fengxiang He, Tieliang Gong, Youcheng Fu, Dacheng Tao
Improved Active Multi-Task Representation Learning via Lasso	To leverage the copious amount of data from source tasks and overcome the scarcity of the target task samples, representation learning based on multi-task pretraining has become a standard approach in many applications. However, up until now, most existing works design a source task selection strategy from a purely empirical perspective. Recently, Chen et al., 2022 gave the first active multi-task representation learning (A-MTRL) algorithm which adaptively samples from source tasks and can provably reduce the total sample complexity using the L2-regularized-target-source-relevance parameter $\nu^2$. But their work is theoretically suboptimal in terms of total source sample complexity and is less practical in some real-world scenarios where sparse training source task selection is desired. In this paper, we address both issues. Specifically, we show the strict dominance of the L1-regularized-relevance-based ($\nu^1$-based) strategy by giving a lower bound for the $\nu^2$-based strategy. When $\nu^1$ is unknown, we propose a practical algorithm that uses the LASSO program to estimate $\nu^1$. Our algorithm successfully recovers the optimal result in the known case. In addition to our sample complexity results, we also characterize the potential of our $\nu^1$-based strategy in sample-cost-sensitive settings. Finally, we provide experiments on real-world computer vision datasets to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23b	Yiping Wang, Yifang Chen, Kevin Jamieson, Simon Shaolei Du
Tight Regret Bounds for Single-pass Streaming Multi-armed Bandits	Regret minimization in streaming multi-armed bandits (MABs) has been studied extensively, and recent work has shown that algorithms with $o(K)$ memory have to incur $\Omega(T^{2/3})$ regret, where $K$ and $T$ are the numbers of arms and trials. However, the previous best regret upper bound is still $O(K^{1/3} T^{2/3}\log^{1/3}(T))$, which is achieved by the simple uniform exploration algorithm. In this paper, we close this gap and complete the picture of regret minimization in single-pass streaming MABs. We first improve the regret lower bound to $\Omega(K^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ for algorithms with $o(K)$ memory. We then show that the $\log^{1/3}(T)$ factor is not necessary by designing algorithms with at most $O(\log^*(K))$-arm memory and achieve $O(K^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ expected regret based on streaming $\varepsilon$-best arm algorithms. We further tested the empirical performances of our algorithms on simulated MABs instances, where the proposed algorithms outperform the benchmark uniform exploration algorithm by a large margin and, on occasion, reduce the regret by up to 70%.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23a	Chen Wang
Bandit Multi-linear DR-Submodular Maximization and Its Applications on Adversarial Submodular Bandits	We investigate the online bandit learning of the monotone multi-linear DR-submodular functions, designing the algorithm $\mathtt{BanditMLSM}$ that attains $O(T^{2/3}\log T)$ of $(1-1/e)$-regret. Then we reduce submodular bandit with partition matroid constraint and bandit sequential monotone maximization to the online bandit learning of the monotone multi-linear DR-submodular functions, attaining $O(T^{2/3}\log T)$ of $(1-1/e)$-regret in both problems, which improve the existing results. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to give a sublinear regret algorithm for the submodular bandit with partition matroid constraint. A special case of this problem is studied by Streeter et al.(2009). They prove a $O(T^{4/5})$ $(1-1/e)$-regret upper bound. For the bandit sequential submodular maximization, the existing work proves an $O(T^{2/3})$ regret with a suboptimal $1/2$ approximation ratio (Niazadeh et al. 2021).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wan23e	Zongqi Wan, Jialin Zhang, Wei Chen, Xiaoming Sun, Zhijie Zhang
Multiplier Bootstrap-based Exploration	Despite the great interest in the bandit problem, designing efficient algorithms for complex models remains challenging, as there is typically no analytical way to quantify uncertainty. In this paper, we propose Multiplier Bootstrap-based Exploration (MBE), a novel exploration strategy that is applicable to any reward model amenable to weighted loss minimization. We prove both instance-dependent and instance-independent rate-optimal regret bounds for MBE in sub-Gaussian multi-armed bandits. With extensive simulation and real-data experiments, we show the generality and adaptivity of MBE.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wan23d	Runzhe Wan, Haoyu Wei, Branislav Kveton, Rui Song
SeMAIL: Eliminating Distractors in Visual Imitation via Separated Models	Model-based imitation learning (MBIL) is a popular reinforcement learning method that improves sample efficiency on high-dimension input sources, such as images and videos. Following the convention of MBIL research, existing algorithms are highly deceptive by task-irrelevant information, especially moving distractors in videos. To tackle this problem, we propose a new algorithm - named Separated Model-based Adversarial Imitation Learning (SeMAIL) - decoupling the environment dynamics into two parts by task-relevant dependency, which is determined by agent actions, and training separately. In this way, the agent can imagine its trajectories and imitate the expert behavior efficiently in task-relevant state space. Our method achieves near-expert performance on various visual control tasks with complex observations and the more challenging tasks with different backgrounds from expert observations.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wan23c	Shenghua Wan, Yucen Wang, Minghao Shao, Ruying Chen, De-Chuan Zhan
Poisoning Language Models During Instruction Tuning	"Instruction-tuned LMs such as ChatGPT, FLAN, and InstructGPT are finetuned on datasets that contain user-submitted examples, e.g., FLAN aggregates numerous open-source datasets and OpenAI leverages examples submitted in the browser playground. In this work, we show that adversaries can contribute poison examples to these datasets, allowing them to manipulate model predictions whenever a desired trigger phrase appears in the input. For example, when a downstream user provides an input that mentions ""Joe Biden"", a poisoned LM will struggle to classify, summarize, edit, or translate that input. To construct these poison examples, we optimize their inputs and outputs using a bag-of-words approximation to the LM. We evaluate our method on open-source instruction-tuned LMs. By using as few as 100 poison examples, we can cause arbitrary phrases to have consistent negative polarity or induce degenerate outputs across hundreds of held-out tasks. Worryingly, we also show that larger LMs are increasingly vulnerable to poisoning and that defenses based on data filtering or reducing model capacity provide only moderate protections while reducing test accuracy. Notice: This paper contains tasks with obscene content."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wan23b	Alexander Wan, Eric Wallace, Sheng Shen, Dan Klein
UPSCALE: Unconstrained Channel Pruning	As neural networks grow in size and complexity, inference speeds decline. To combat this, one of the most effective compression techniques – channel pruning – removes channels from weights. However, for multi-branch segments of a model, channel removal can introduce inference-time memory copies. In turn, these copies increase inference latency – so much so that the pruned model can be slower than the unpruned model. As a workaround, pruners conventionally constrain certain channels to be pruned together. This fully eliminates memory copies but, as we show, significantly impairs accuracy. We now have a dilemma: Remove constraints but increase latency, or add constraints and impair accuracy. In response, our insight is to reorder channels at export time, (1) reducing latency by reducing memory copies and (2) improving accuracy by removing constraints. Using this insight, we design a generic algorithm UPSCALE to prune models with any pruning pattern. By removing constraints from existing pruners, we improve ImageNet accuracy for post-training pruned models by 2.1 points on average – benefiting DenseNet (+16.9), EfficientNetV2 (+7.9), and ResNet (+6.2). Furthermore, by reordering channels, UPSCALE improves inference speeds by up to 2x over a baseline export.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wan23a	Alvin Wan, Hanxiang Hao, Kaushik Patnaik, Yueyang Xu, Omer Hadad, David Güera, Zhile Ren, Qi Shan
Investigating the Role of Model-Based Learning in Exploration and Transfer	State of the art reinforcement learning has enabled training agents on tasks of ever increasing complexity. However, the current paradigm tends to favor training agents from scratch on every new task or on collections of tasks with a view towards generalizing to novel task configurations. The former suffers from poor data efficiency while the latter is difficult when test tasks are out-of-distribution. Agents that can effectively transfer their knowledge about the world pose a potential solution to these issues. In this paper, we investigate transfer learning in the context of model-based agents. Specifically, we aim to understand where exactly environment models have an advantage and why. We find that a model-based approach outperforms controlled model-free baselines for transfer learning. Through ablations, we show that both the policy and dynamics model learnt through exploration matter for successful transfer. We demonstrate our results across three domains which vary in their requirements for transfer: in-distribution procedural (Crafter), in-distribution identical (RoboDesk), and out-of-distribution (Meta-World). Our results show that intrinsic exploration combined with environment models present a viable direction towards agents that are self-supervised and able to generalize to novel reward functions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/walker23a	Jacob C Walker, Eszter Vértes, Yazhe Li, Gabriel Dulac-Arnold, Ankesh Anand, Theophane Weber, Jessica B Hamrick
Fast Private Kernel Density Estimation via Locality Sensitive Quantization	"We study efficient mechanisms for differentially private kernel density estimation (DP-KDE). Prior work for the Gaussian kernel described algorithms that run in time exponential in the number of dimensions $d$. This paper breaks the exponential barrier, and shows how the KDE can privately be approximated in time linear in $d$, making it feasible for high-dimensional data. We also present improved bounds for low-dimensional data. Our results are obtained through a general framework, which we term Locality Sensitive Quantization (LSQ), for constructing private KDE mechanisms where existing KDE approximation techniques can be applied. It lets us leverage several efficient non-private KDE methods—like Random Fourier Features, the Fast Gauss Transform, and Locality Sensitive Hashing—and ""privatize"" them in a black-box manner. Our experiments demonstrate that our resulting DP-KDE mechanisms are fast and accurate on large datasets in both high and low dimensions."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wagner23a	Tal Wagner, Yonatan Naamad, Nina Mishra
Leveraging Offline Data in Online Reinforcement Learning	Two central paradigms have emerged in the reinforcement learning (RL) community: online RL and offline RL. In the online RL setting, the agent has no prior knowledge of the environment, and must interact with it in order to find an $\epsilon$-optimal policy. In the offline RL setting, the learner instead has access to a fixed dataset to learn from, but is unable to otherwise interact with the environment, and must obtain the best policy it can from this offline data. Practical scenarios often motivate an intermediate setting: if we have some set of offline data and may also interact with the environment, how can we best use the offline data to minimize the number of online interactions necessary to learn an $\epsilon$-optimal policy. In this work, we consider this setting, which we call the FineTuneRL setting, for MDPs with linear structure. We characterize the necessary number of online samples needed in this setting given access to some offline dataset, and develop an algorithm, FTPedel, which is provably optimal, up to $H$ factors. We show through an explicit example that combining offline data with online interactions can lead to a provable improvement over either purely offline or purely online RL. Finally, our results illustrate the distinction between verifiable learning, the typical setting considered in online RL, and unverifiable learning, the setting often considered in offline RL, and show that there is a formal separation between these regimes.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wagenmaker23a	Andrew Wagenmaker, Aldo Pacchiano
On Provable Copyright Protection for Generative Models	There is a growing concern that learned conditional generative models may output samples that are substantially similar to some copyrighted data $C$ that was in their training set. We give a formal definition of near access-freeness (NAF) and prove bounds on the probability that a model satisfying this definition outputs a sample similar to $C$, even if $C$ is included in its training set. Roughly speaking, a generative model $p$ is $k$-NAF if for every potentially copyrighted data $C$, the output of $p$ diverges by at most $k$-bits from the output of a model $q$ that did not access $C$ at all. We also give generative model learning algorithms, which efficiently modify the original generative model learning algorithm in a black box manner, that output generative models with strong bounds on the probability of sampling protected content. Furthermore, we provide promising experiments for both language (transformers) and image (diffusion) generative models, showing minimal degradation in output quality while ensuring strong protections against sampling protected content.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/vyas23b	Nikhil Vyas, Sham M.

Competitive Gradient Optimization	We study the problem of convergence to a stationary point in zero-sum games. We propose competitive gradient optimization (CGO), a gradient-based method that incorporates the interactions between two players in zero-sum games for its iterative updates. We provide a continuous-time analysis of CGO and its convergence properties while showing that in the continuous limit, previous methods degenerate to their gradient descent ascent (GDA) variants. We further provide a rate of convergence to stationary points in the discrete-time setting. We propose a generalized class of $\alpha$-coherent functions and show that for strictly $\alpha$-coherent functions, CGO ensures convergence to a saddle point. Moreover, we propose optimistic CGO (oCGO), an optimistic variant, for which we show a convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{n})$ to saddle points for $\alpha$-coherent functions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/vyas23a	Abhijeet Vyas, Brian Bullins, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli
Vector Quantized Wasserstein Auto-Encoder	Learning deep discrete latent presentations offers a promise of better symbolic and summarized abstractions that are more useful to subsequent downstream tasks. Inspired by the seminal Vector Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder (VQ-VAE), most of work in learning deep discrete representations has mainly focused on improving the original VQ-VAE form and none of them has studied learning deep discrete representations from the generative viewpoint. In this work, we study learning deep discrete representations from the generative viewpoint. Specifically, we endow discrete distributions over sequences of codewords and learn a deterministic decoder that transports the distribution over the sequences of codewords to the data distribution via minimizing a WS distance between them. We develop further theories to connect it with the clustering viewpoint of WS distance, allowing us to have a better and more controllable clustering solution. Finally, we empirically evaluate our method on several well-known benchmarks, where it achieves better qualitative and quantitative performances than the other VQ-VAE variants in terms of the codebook utilization and image reconstruction/generation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/vuong23a	Long Tung Vuong, Trung Le, He Zhao, Chuanxia Zheng, Mehrtash Harandi, Jianfei Cai, Dinh Phung
Improving l1-Certified Robustness via Randomized Smoothing by Leveraging Box Constraints	Randomized smoothing is a popular method to certify robustness of image classifiers to adversarial input perturbations. It is the only certification technique which scales directly to datasets of higher dimension such as ImageNet. However, current techniques are not able to utilize the fact that any adversarial example has to lie in the image space, that is $[0,1]^d$; otherwise, one can trivially detect it. To address this suboptimality, we derive new certification formulae which lead to significant improvements in the certified $\ell_1$-robustness without the need of adapting the classifiers or change of smoothing distributions.

Topological Singularity Detection at Multiple Scales	The manifold hypothesis, which assumes that data lies on or close to an unknown manifold of low intrinsic dimension, is a staple of modern machine learning research. However, recent work has shown that real-world data exhibits distinct non-manifold structures, i.e. singularities, that can lead to erroneous findings. Detecting such singularities is therefore crucial as a precursor to interpolation and inference tasks. We address this issue by developing a topological framework that (i) quantifies the local intrinsic dimension, and (ii) yields a Euclidicity score for assessing the 'manifoldness' of a point along multiple scales. Our approach identifies singularities of complex spaces, while also capturing singular structures and local geometric complexity in image data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/von-rohrscheidt23a	Julius Von Rohrscheidt, Bastian Rieck
Transformers Learn In-Context by Gradient Descent	At present, the mechanisms of in-context learning in Transformers are not well understood and remain mostly an intuition. In this paper, we suggest that training Transformers on auto-regressive objectives is closely related to gradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing a simple weight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations induced by 1) a single linear self-attention layer and by 2) gradient-descent (GD) on a regression loss. Motivated by that construction, we show empirically that when training self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression tasks either the models learned by GD and Transformers show great similarity or, remarkably, the weights found by optimization match the construction. Thus we show how trained Transformers become mesa-optimizers i.e. learn models by gradient descent in their forward pass. This allows us, at least in the domain of regression problems, to mechanistically understand the inner workings of in-context learning in optimized Transformers. Building on this insight, we furthermore identify how Transformers surpass the performance of plain gradient descent by learning an iterative curvature correction and learn linear models on deep data representations to solve non-linear regression tasks. Finally, we discuss intriguing parallels to a mechanism identified to be crucial for in-context learning termed induction-head (Olsson et al., 2022) and show how it could be understood as a specific case of in-context learning by gradient descent learning within Transformers.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/von-oswald23a	Johannes Von Oswald, Eyvind Niklasson, Ettore Randazzo, Joao Sacramento, Alexander Mordvintsev, Andrey Zhmoginov, Max Vladymyrov
Eventual Discounting Temporal Logic Counterfactual Experience Replay	Linear temporal logic (LTL) offers a simplified way of specifying tasks for policy optimization that may otherwise be difficult to describe with scalar reward functions. However, the standard RL framework can be too myopic to find maximally LTL satisfying policies. This paper makes two contributions. First, we develop a new value-function based proxy, using a technique we call eventual discounting, under which one can find policies that satisfy the LTL specification with highest achievable probability. Second, we develop a new experience replay method for generating off-policy data from on-policy rollouts via counterfactual reasoning on different ways of satisfying the LTL specification. Our experiments, conducted in both discrete and continuous state-action spaces, confirm the effectiveness of our counterfactual experience replay approach.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/voloshin23a	Cameron Voloshin, Abhinav Verma, Yisong Yue
Arithmetic Sampling: Parallel Diverse Decoding for Large Language Models	Decoding methods for large language models often trade-off between diversity of outputs and parallelism of computation. Methods such as beam search and Gumbel top-k sampling can guarantee a different output for each element of the beam, but are not easy to parallelize. Alternatively, methods such as temperature sampling and its modifications (top-k sampling, nucleus sampling, typical decoding, and others), are embarrassingly parallel, but have no guarantees about duplicate samples. We present a framework for sampling according to an arithmetic code book implicitly defined by a large language model, compatible with common sampling variations, with provable beam diversity under certain conditions, as well as being embarrassingly parallel and providing unbiased and consistent expectations from the original model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on WMT machine translation, more than halving the standard deviation when estimating expected BLEU score reward, and closing the BLEU score gap between independent sampling and beam search by up to 63%.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/vilnis23a	Luke Vilnis, Yury Zemlyanskiy, Patrick Murray, Alexandre Tachard Passos, Sumit Sanghai
Low-Variance Gradient Estimation in Unrolled Computation Graphs with ES-Single	We propose an evolution strategies-based algorithm for estimating gradients in unrolled computation graphs, called ES-Single. Similarly to the recently-proposed Persistent Evolution Strategies (PES), ES-Single is unbiased, and overcomes chaos arising from recursive function applications by smoothing the meta-loss landscape. ES-Single samples a single perturbation per particle, that is kept fixed over the course of an inner problem (e.g., perturbations are not re-sampled for each partial unroll). Compared to PES, ES-Single is simpler to implement and has lower variance: the variance of ES-Single is constant with respect to the number of truncated unrolls, removing a key barrier in applying ES to long inner problems using short truncations. We show that ES-Single is unbiased for quadratic inner problems, and demonstrate empirically that its variance can be substantially lower than that of PES. ES-Single consistently outperforms PES on a variety of tasks, including a synthetic benchmark task, hyperparameter optimization, training recurrent neural networks, and training learned optimizers.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/vicol23a	Paul Vicol
TabLeak: Tabular Data Leakage in Federated Learning	While federated learning (FL) promises to preserve privacy, recent works in the image and text domains have shown that training updates leak private client data. However, most high-stakes applications of FL (e.g., in healthcare and finance) use tabular data, where the risk of data leakage has not yet been explored. A successful attack for tabular data must address two key challenges unique to the domain: (i) obtaining a solution to a high-variance mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem, and (ii) enabling human assessment of the reconstruction as unlike for image and text data, direct human inspection is not possible. In this work we address these challenges and propose TabLeak, the first comprehensive reconstruction attack on tabular data. TabLeak is based on two key contributions: (i) a method which leverages a softmax relaxation and pooled ensembling to solve the optimization problem, and (ii) an entropy-based uncertainty quantification scheme to enable human assessment. We evaluate TabLeak on four tabular datasets for both FedSGD and FedAvg training protocols, and show that it successfully breaks several settings previously deemed safe. For instance, we extract large subsets of private data at $>$90% accuracy even at the large batch size of 128. Our findings demonstrate that current high-stakes tabular FL is excessively vulnerable to leakage attacks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/vero23a	Mark Vero, Mislav Balunovic, Dimitar Iliev Dimitrov, Martin Vechev
AbODE: Ab initio antibody design using conjoined ODEs	Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins that neutralize pathogens and constitute the core of our adaptive immune system. De novo generation of new antibodies that target specific antigens holds the key to accelerating vaccine discovery. However, this co-design of the amino acid sequence and the 3D structure subsumes and accentuates, some central challenges from multiple tasks including protein folding (sequence to structure), inverse folding (structure to sequence), and docking (binding). We strive to surmount these challenges with a new generative model AbODE that extends graph PDEs to accommodate both contextual information and external interactions. Unlike existing approaches, AbODE uses a single round of full-shot decoding, and elicits continuous differential attention that encapsulates, and evolves with, latent interactions within the antibody as well as those involving the antigen. We unravel fundamental connections between AbODE and temporal networks as well as graph-matching networks. The proposed model significantly outperforms existing methods on standard metrics across benchmarks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/verma23a	Yogesh Verma, Markus Heinonen, Vikas Garg
Multi-Environment Pretraining Enables Transfer to Action Limited Datasets	Using massive datasets to train large-scale models has emerged as a dominant approach for broad generalization in natural language and vision applications. In reinforcement learning, however, a key challenge is that available data of sequential decision making is often not annotated with actions - for example, videos of game-play are much more available than sequences of frames paired with their logged game controls. We propose to circumvent this challenge by combining large but sparsely-annotated datasets from a	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/venuto23a	David Venuto, Sherry Yang, Pieter Abbeel, Doina Precup, Igor Mordatch, Ofir Nachum
Learning the Right Layers a Data-Driven Layer-Aggregation Strategy for Semi-Supervised Learning on Multilayer Graphs	Clustering (or community detection) on multilayer graphs poses several additional complications with respect to standard graphs as different layers may be characterized by different structures and types of information. One of the major challenges is to establish the extent to which each layer contributes to the cluster assignment in order to effectively take advantage of the multilayer structure and improve upon the classification obtained using the individual layers or their union. However, making an informed a-priori assessment about the clustering information content of the layers can be very complicated. In this work, we assume a semi-supervised learning setting, where the class of a small percentage of nodes is initially provided, and we propose a parameter-free Laplacian-regularized model that learns an optimal nonlinear combination of the different layers from the available input labels. The learning algorithm is based on a Frank-Wolfe optimization scheme with inexact gradient, combined with a modified Label Propagation iteration. We provide a detailed convergence analysis of the algorithm and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that the proposed method compares favourably with a variety of baselines and outperforms each individual layer when used in isolation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/venturini23a	Sara Venturini, Andrea Cristofari, Francesco Rinaldi, Francesco Tudisco
The Virtues of Laziness in Model-based RL: A Unified Objective and Algorithms	"We propose a novel approach to addressing two fundamental challenges in Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL): the computational expense of repeatedly finding a good policy in the learned model, and the objective mismatch between model fitting and policy computation. Our ""lazy"" method leverages a novel unified objective, Performance Difference via Advantage in Model, to capture the performance difference between the learned policy and expert policy under the true dynamics. This objective demonstrates that optimizing the expected policy advantage in the learned model under an exploration distribution is sufficient for policy computation, resulting in a significant boost in computational efficiency compared to traditional planning methods. Additionally, the unified objective uses a value moment matching term for model fitting, which is aligned with the model's usage during policy computation.

Fast $(1+\varepsilon)$-Approximation Algorithms for Binary Matrix Factorization	We introduce efficient $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithms for the binary matrix factorization (BMF) problem, where the inputs are a matrix $\mathbf{A}\in\{0,1\}^{n\times d}$, a rank parameter $k>0$, as well as an accuracy parameter $\varepsilon>0$, and the goal is to approximate $\mathbf{A}$ as a product of low-rank factors $\mathbf{U}\in\{0,1\}^{n\times k}$ and $\mathbf{V}\in\{0,1\}^{k\times d}$. Equivalently, we want to find $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$ that minimize the Frobenius loss $\|\mathbf{U}\mathbf{V} - \mathbf{A}\|_F^2$. Before this work, the state-of-the-art for this problem was the approximation algorithm of Kumar et. al. [ICML 2019], which achieves a $C$-approximation for some constant $C\ge 576$. We give the first $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm using running time singly exponential in $k$, where $k$ is typically a small integer. Our techniques generalize to other common variants of the BMF problem, admitting bicriteria $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithms for $L_p$ loss functions and the setting where matrix operations are performed in $\mathbb{F}_2$. Our approach can be implemented in standard big data models, such as the streaming or distributed models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/velingker23a	Ameya Velingker, Maximilian Vötsch, David Woodruff, Samson Zhou
Optimal LP Rounding and Linear-Time Approximation Algorithms for Clustering Edge-Colored Hypergraphs	We study the approximability of an existing framework for clustering edge-colored hypergraphs, which is closely related to chromatic correlation clustering and is motivated by machine learning and data mining applications where the goal is to cluster a set of objects based on multiway interactions of different categories or types. We present improved approximation guarantees based on linear programming, and show they are tight by proving a matching integrality gap. Our results also include new approximation hardness results, a combinatorial 2-approximation whose runtime is linear in the hypergraph size, and several new connections to well-studied objectives such as vertex cover and hypergraph multiway cut.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/veldt23a	Nate Veldt
Conditional Tree Matching for Inference-Time Adaptation of Tree Prediction Models	We present CTreeOT, a convergent, differentiable algorithm for matching two trees when each tree is conditioned on some input. Such conditional tree matching is useful for light-weight, few-shot adaptation of tree prediction models without parameter fine-tuning. CTreeOT includes an alignment algorithm that extends the popular Sinkhorn algorithm for matching tree nodes while supporting constraints on tree edges. The algorithm involves alternating between matrix rescaling and message passing updates, and can be efficiently expressed as GPU tensor operations. The second part of CTreeOT is fine-grained relevance-based reweighting of nodes that makes the match scores useful for prediction tasks. We demonstrate the usefulness of CTreeOT for cross-schema adaptation of Text-to-SQL, a popular semantic parsing task. We show that compared to state-of-the-art methods, we achieve significant increase in adaptation accuracy.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/varma23a	Harshit Varma, Abhijeet Awasthi, Sunita Sarawagi
Best Arm Identification in Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits	We investigate the problem of best arm identification in Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits (MAMABs) where the rewards are defined through a factor graph. The objective is to find an optimal global action with a prescribed level of confidence and minimal sample complexity. We derive a tight instance-specific lower bound of the sample complexity and characterize the corresponding optimal sampling strategy. Unfortunately, this bound is obtained by solving a combinatorial optimization problem with a number of variables and constraints exponentially growing with the number of agents. We leverage Mean Field (MF) techniques to obtain, in a computationally efficient manner, an approximation of the lower bound. The approximation scales at most as $\rho K^d$ (where $\rho$, $K$, and $d$ denote the number of factors in the graph, the number of possible actions per agent, and the maximal degree of the factor graph). We devise MF-TaS (Mean-Field-Track-and-Stop), an algorithm whose sample complexity provably matches our approximated lower bound. We illustrate the performance of MF-TaS numerically using both synthetic and real-world experiments (e.g., to solve the antenna tilt optimization problem in radio communication networks).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/vannella23a	Filippo Vannella, Alexandre Proutiere, Jaeseong Jeong
Accounting For Informative Sampling When Learning to Forecast Treatment Outcomes Over Time	Machine learning (ML) holds great potential for accurately forecasting treatment outcomes over time, which could ultimately enable the adoption of more individualized treatment strategies in many practical applications. However, a significant challenge that has been largely overlooked by the ML literature on this topic is the presence of informative sampling in observational data. When instances are observed irregularly over time, sampling times are typically not random, but rather informative–depending on the instance's characteristics, past outcomes, and administered treatments. In this work, we formalize informative sampling as a covariate shift problem and show that it can prohibit accurate estimation of treatment outcomes if not properly accounted for. To overcome this challenge, we present a general framework for learning treatment outcomes in the presence of informative sampling using inverse intensity-weighting, and propose a novel method, TESAR-CDE, that instantiates this framework using Neural CDEs. Using a simulation environment based on a clinical use case, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in learning under informative sampling.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/vanderschueren23a	Toon Vanderschueren, Alicia Curth, Wouter Verbeke, Mihaela Van Der Schaar
Causal Isotonic Calibration for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects	We propose causal isotonic calibration, a novel nonparametric method for calibrating predictors of heterogeneous treatment effects. Furthermore, we introduce cross-calibration, a data-efficient variant of calibration that eliminates the need for hold-out calibration sets. Cross-calibration leverages cross-fitted predictors and generates a single calibrated predictor using all available data. Under weak conditions that do not assume monotonicity, we establish that both causal isotonic calibration and cross-calibration achieve fast doubly-robust calibration rates, as long as either the propensity score or outcome regression is estimated accurately in a suitable sense. The proposed causal isotonic calibrator can be wrapped around any black-box learning algorithm, providing robust and distribution-free calibration guarantees while preserving predictive performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/van-der-laan23a	Lars Van Der Laan, Ernesto Ulloa-Perez, Marco Carone, Alex Luedtke
Trading-Off Payments and Accuracy in Online Classification with Paid Stochastic Experts	"We investigate online classification with paid stochastic experts. Here, before making their prediction, each expert must be paid. The amount that we pay each expert directly influences the accuracy of their prediction through some unknown Lipschitz ""productivity"" function. In each round, the learner must decide how much to pay each expert and then make a prediction. They incur a cost equal to a weighted sum of the prediction error and upfront payments for all experts. We introduce an online learning algorithm whose total cost after $T$ rounds exceeds that of a predictor which knows the productivity of all experts in advance by at most $\mathcal{O}\big(K^2(\ln T)\sqrt{T}\big)$ where $K$ is the number of experts. In order to achieve this result, we combine Lipschitz bandits and online classification with surrogate losses. These tools allow us to improve upon the bound of order $T^{2/3}$ one would obtain in the standard Lipschitz bandit setting. Our algorithm is empirically evaluated on synthetic data."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/van-der-hoeven23a	Dirk Van Der Hoeven, Ciara Pike-Burke, Hao Qiu, Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi
Synthetic Data, Real Errors: How (Not) to Publish and Use Synthetic Data	Generating synthetic data through generative models is gaining interest in the ML community and beyond, promising a future where datasets can be tailored to individual needs. Unfortunately, synthetic data is usually not perfect, resulting in potential errors in downstream tasks. In this work we explore how the generative process affects the downstream ML task. We show that the naive synthetic data approach—using synthetic data as if it is real—leads to downstream models and analyses that do not generalize well to real data. As a first step towards better ML in the synthetic data regime, we introduce Deep Generative Ensemble (DGE)—a framework inspired by Deep Ensembles that aims to implicitly approximate the posterior distribution over the generative process model parameters. DGE improves downstream model training, evaluation, and uncertainty quantification, vastly outperforming the naive approach on average. The largest improvements are achieved for minority classes and low-density regions of the original data, for which the generative uncertainty is largest.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/van-breugel23a	Boris Van Breugel, Zhaozhi Qian, Mihaela Van Der Schaar
Delayed Feedback in Kernel Bandits	Black box optimisation of an unknown function from expensive and noisy evaluations is a ubiquitous problem in machine learning, academic research and industrial production. An abstraction of the problem can be formulated as a kernel based bandit problem (also known as Bayesian optimisation), where a learner aims at optimising a kernelized function through sequential noisy observations. The existing work predominantly assumes feedback is immediately available; an assumption which fails in many real world situations, including recommendation systems, clinical trials and hyperparameter tuning. We consider a kernel bandit problem under stochastically delayed feedback, and propose an algorithm with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\sqrt{\Gamma_k(T) T}+\mathbb{E}[\tau]\right)$ regret, where $T$ is the number of time steps, $\Gamma_k(T)$ is the maximum information gain of the kernel with $T$ observations, and $\tau$ is the delay random variable. This represents a significant improvement over the state of the art regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\Gamma_k(T)\sqrt{ T}+\mathbb{E}[\tau]\Gamma_k(T)\right)$ reported in (Verma et al., 2022). In particular, for very non-smooth kernels, the information gain grows almost linearly in time, trivializing the existing results. We also validate our theoretical results with simulations.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/vakili23a	Sattar Vakili, Danyal Ahmed, Alberto Bernacchia, Ciara Pike-Burke
Random Grid Neural Processes for Parametric Partial Differential Equations	We introduce a new class of spatially stochastic physics and data informed deep latent models for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) which operate through scalable variational neural processes. We achieve this by assigning probability measures to the spatial domain, which allows us to treat collocation grids probabilistically as random variables to be marginalised out. Adapting this spatial statistics view, we solve forward and inverse problems for parametric PDEs in a way that leads to the construction of Gaussian process models of solution fields. The implementation of these random grids poses a unique set of challenges for inverse physics informed deep learning frameworks and we propose a new architecture called Grid Invariant Convolutional Networks (GICNets) to overcome these challenges. We further show how to incorporate noisy data in a principled manner into our physics informed model to improve predictions for problems where data may be available but whose measurement location does not coincide with any fixed mesh or grid. The proposed method is tested on a nonlinear Poisson problem, Burgers equation, and Navier-Stokes equations, and we provide extensive numerical comparisons. We demonstrate significant computational advantages over current physics informed neural learning methods for parametric PDEs while improving the predictive capabilities and flexibility of these models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/vadeboncoeur23a	Arnaud Vadeboncoeur, Ieva Kazlauskaite, Yanni Papandreou, Fehmi Cirak, Mark Girolami, Omer Deniz Akyildiz
Semi-Dual Unbalanced Quadratic Optimal Transport: fast statistical rates and convergent algorithm.	In this paper, we derive a semi-dual formulation for the problem of unbalanced quadratic optimal transport and we study its stability properties, namely we give upper and lower bounds for the Bregman divergence of the new objective that hold globally. We observe that the new objective gains even more convexity than in the balanced case. We use this formulation to prove the first results on statistical estimation of UOT potentials and we leverage the extra convexity to recover super-parametric rates. Interestingly, unlike in the balanced case, we do not require the potentials to be smooth. Then, use variable metric descent to solve the semi-dual problem for which we prove convergence at a $1/k$ rate for strongly convex potentials and exponential convergence in the balanced case when potentials are also smooth. We emphasize that our convergence results has an interest on its own as it generalizes previous convergence results to non-equivalent metrics. Last, we instantiate a proof-of-concept tractable version of our theoretical algorithm that we benchmark on a 2D experiment in the balanced case and on a medium dimension synthetic experiment in the unbalanced case.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/vacher23a	Adrien Vacher, François-Xavier Vialard
The Monge Gap: A Regularizer to Learn All Transport Maps	"Optimal transport (OT) theory has been used in machine learning to study and characterize maps that can push-forward efficiently a probability measure onto another. Recent works have drawn inspiration from Brenier's theorem, which states that when the ground cost is the squared-Euclidean distance, the ""best"" map to morph a continuous measure in $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ into another must be the gradient of a convex function. To exploit that result, Makkuva et. al (2020); Korotin et. al (2020) consider maps $T=\nabla f_\theta$, where $f_\theta$ is an input convex neural network (ICNN), as defined by Amos et. al (2017), and fit $\theta$ with SGD using samples. Despite their mathematical elegance, fitting OT maps with ICNNs raises many challenges, due notably to the many constraints imposed on $\theta$; the need to approximate the conjugate of $f_\theta$; or the limitation that they only work for the squared-Euclidean cost. More generally, we question the relevance of using Brenier's result, which only applies to densities, to constrain the architecture of candidate maps fitted on samples. Motivated by these limitations, we propose a radically different approach to estimating OT maps: Given a cost $c$ and a reference measure $\rho$, we introduce a regularizer, the Monge gap $\mathcal{M}^c_{\rho}(T)$ of a map $T$. That gap quantifies how far a map $T$ deviates from the ideal properties we expect from a $c$-OT map. In practice, we drop all architecture requirements for $T$ and simply minimize a distance (e.g., the Sinkhorn divergence) between $T\sharp\mu$ and $\nu$, regularized by $\mathcal{M}^c_\rho(T)$. We study $\mathcal{M}^c_{\rho}$ and show how our simple pipeline significantly outperforms other baselines in practice."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/uscidda23a	Théo Uscidda, Marco Cuturi
Private Federated Learning with Autotuned Compression	"We propose new techniques for reducing communication in private federated learning without the need for setting or tuning compression rates. Our on-the-fly methods automatically adjust the compression rate based on the error induced during training, while maintaining provable privacy guarantees through the use of secure aggregation and differential privacy. Our techniques are provably instance-optimal for mean estimation, meaning that they can adapt to the ""hardness of the problem"" with minimal interactivity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on real-world datasets by achieving favorable compression rates without the need for tuning."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ullah23b	Enayat Ullah, Christopher A.

From Adaptive Query Release to Machine Unlearning	We formalize the problem of machine unlearning as design of efficient unlearning algorithms corresponding to learning algorithms which perform a selection of adaptive queries from structured query classes. We give efficient unlearning algorithms for linear and prefix-sum query classes. As applications, we show that unlearning in many problems, in particular, stochastic convex optimization (SCO), can be reduced to the above, yielding improved guarantees for the problem. In particular, for smooth Lipschitz losses and any $\rho>0$, our results yield an unlearning algorithm with excess population risk of $\tilde O\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\rho}\big)$ with unlearning query (gradient) complexity $\tilde O(\rho \cdot \text{Retraining Complexity})$, where $d$ is the model dimensionality and $n$ is the initial number of samples. For non-smooth Lipschitz losses, we give an unlearning algorithm with excess population risk $\tilde O\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\rho}\big)^{1/2}\big)$ with the same unlearning query (gradient) complexity. Furthermore, in the special case of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), such as those in linear and logistic regression, we get dimension-independent rates of $\tilde O\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} +\frac{1}{(n\rho)^{2/3}}\big)$ and $\tilde O\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} +\frac{1}{(n\rho)^{1/3}}\big)$ for smooth Lipschitz and non-smooth Lipschitz losses respectively. Finally, we give generalizations of the above from one unlearning request to	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ullah23a	Enayat Ullah, Raman Arora
Computationally Efficient PAC RL in POMDPs with Latent Determinism and Conditional Embeddings	We study reinforcement learning with function approximation for large-scale Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) where the state space and observation space are large or even continuous. Particularly, we consider Hilbert space embeddings of POMDP where the feature of latent states and the feature of observations admit a conditional Hilbert space embedding of the observation emission process, and the latent state transition is deterministic. Under the function approximation setup where the optimal latent state-action $Q$-function is linear in the state feature, and the optimal $Q$-function has a gap in actions, we provide a computationally and statistically efficient algorithm for finding the exact optimal policy. We show our algorithm's computational and statistical complexities scale polynomially with respect to the horizon and the intrinsic dimension of the feature on the observation space. Furthermore, we show both the deterministic latent transitions and gap assumptions are necessary to avoid statistical complexity exponential in horizon or dimension. Since our guarantee does not have an explicit dependence on the size of the state and observation spaces, our algorithm provably scales to large-scale POMDPs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/uehara23a	Masatoshi Uehara, Ayush Sekhari, Jason D.

Submodular Order Functions and Assortment Optimization	We define a new class of set functions that in addition to being monotone and subadditive, also admit a very limited form of submodularity defined over a permutation of the ground set. We refer to this permutation as a submodular order. We give fast algorithms with strong approximation guarantees for maximizing submodular order functions under a variety of constraints. Applying this new notion to the problem of constrained assortment optimization in fundamental choice models, we obtain new algorithms that are both faster and have stronger approximation guarantees (in some cases, first algorithm with constant factor guarantee). We also show an intriguing connection to the maximization of monotone submodular functions in the streaming model, where we recover best known approximation guarantees as a corollary of our results.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/udwani23a	Rajan Udwani
Jump-Start Reinforcement Learning	Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a theoretical framework for continuously improving an agent's behavior via trial and error. However, efficiently learning policies from scratch can be very difficult, particularly for tasks that present exploration challenges. In such settings, it might be desirable to initialize RL with an existing policy, offline data, or demonstrations. However, naively performing such initialization in RL often works poorly, especially for value-based methods. In this paper, we present a meta algorithm that can use offline data, demonstrations, or a pre-existing policy to initialize an RL policy, and is compatible with any RL approach. In particular, we propose Jump-Start Reinforcement Learning (JSRL), an algorithm that employs two policies to solve tasks: a guide-policy, and an exploration-policy. By using the guide-policy to form a curriculum of starting states for the exploration-policy, we are able to efficiently improve performance on a set of simulated robotic tasks. We show via experiments that it is able to significantly outperform existing imitation and reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly in the small-data regime. In addition, we provide an upper bound on the sample complexity of JSRL and show that with the help of a guide-policy, one can improve the sample complexity for non-optimism exploration methods from exponential in horizon to polynomial.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/uchendu23a	Ikechukwu Uchendu, Ted Xiao, Yao Lu, Banghua Zhu, Mengyuan Yan, Joséphine Simon, Matthew Bennice, Chuyuan Fu, Cong Ma, Jiantao Jiao, Sergey Levine, Karol Hausman

Expected Gradients of Maxout Networks and Consequences to Parameter Initialization	We study the gradients of a maxout network with respect to inputs and parameters and obtain bounds for the moments depending on the architecture and the parameter distribution. We observe that the distribution of the input-output Jacobian depends on the input, which complicates a stable parameter initialization. Based on the moments of the gradients, we formulate parameter initialization strategies that avoid vanishing and exploding gradients in wide networks. Experiments with deep fully-connected and convolutional networks show that this strategy improves SGD and Adam training of deep maxout networks. In addition, we obtain refined bounds on the expected number of linear regions, results on the expected curve length distortion, and results on the NTK.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tseran23a	Hanna Tseran, Guido Montufar

Mimetic Initialization of Self-Attention Layers	"It is notoriously difficult to train Transformers on small datasets; typically, large pre-trained models are instead used as the starting point. We explore the weights of such pre-trained Transformers (particularly for vision) to attempt to find reasons for this discrepancy. Surprisingly, we find that simply initializing the weights of self-attention layers so that they ""look"" more like their pre-trained counterparts allows us to train vanilla Transformers faster and to higher final accuracies, particularly on vision tasks such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet classification, where we see gains in accuracy of over 5% and 4%, respectively. Our initialization scheme is closed form, learning-free, and very simple: we set the product of the query and key weights to be approximately the identity, and the product of the value and projection weights to approximately the negative identity. As this mimics the patterns we saw in pre-trained Transformers, we call the technique ""mimetic initialization""."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/trockman23a	Asher Trockman, J Zico Kolter
Discrete Key-Value Bottleneck	Deep neural networks perform well on classification tasks where data streams are i.i.d. and labeled data is abundant. Challenges emerge with non-stationary training data streams such as continual learning. One powerful approach that has addressed this challenge involves pre-training of large encoders on volumes of readily available data, followed by task-specific tuning. Given a new task, however, updating the weights of these encoders is challenging as a large number of weights needs to be fine-tuned, and as a result, they forget information about the previous tasks. In the present work, we propose a model architecture to address this issue, building upon a discrete bottleneck containing pairs of separate and learnable key-value codes. Our paradigm will be to encode; process the representation via a discrete bottleneck; and decode. Here, the input is fed to the pre-trained encoder, the output of the encoder is used to select the nearest keys, and the corresponding values are fed to the decoder to solve the current task. The model can only fetch and re-use a sparse number of these key-value pairs during inference, enabling	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/trauble23a	Frederik Träuble, Anirudh Goyal, Nasim Rahaman, Michael Curtis Mozer, Kenji Kawaguchi, Yoshua Bengio, Bernhard Schölkopf
Fully Bayesian Autoencoders with Latent Sparse Gaussian Processes	We present a fully Bayesian autoencoder model that treats both local latent variables and global decoder parameters in a Bayesian fashion. This approach allows for flexible priors and posterior approximations while keeping the inference costs low. To achieve this, we introduce an amortized MCMC approach by utilizing an implicit stochastic network to learn sampling from the posterior over local latent variables. Furthermore, we extend the model by incorporating a Sparse Gaussian Process prior over the latent space, allowing for a fully Bayesian treatment of inducing points and kernel hyperparameters and leading to improved scalability. Additionally, we enable Deep Gaussian Process priors on the latent space and the handling of missing data. We evaluate our model on a range of experiments focusing on dynamic representation learning and generative modeling, demonstrating the strong performance of our approach in comparison to existing methods that combine Gaussian Processes and autoencoders.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tran23a	Ba-Hien Tran, Babak Shahbaba, Stephan Mandt, Maurizio Filippone
Robust Weak Supervision with Variational Auto-Encoders	Recent advances in weak supervision (WS) techniques allow to mitigate the enormous cost and effort of human data annotation for supervised machine learning by automating it using simple rule-based labelling functions (LFs). However, LFs need to be carefully designed, often requiring expert domain knowledge and extensive validation for existing WS methods to be effective. To tackle this, we propose the Weak Supervision Variational Auto-Encoder (WS-VAE), a novel framework that combines unsupervised representation learning and weak labelling to reduce the dependence of WS on expert and manual engineering of LFs. Our technique learns from inputs and weak labels jointly to capture the input signals distribution with a latent space. The unsupervised representation component of the WS-VAE regularises the inference of weak labels, while a specifically designed decoder allows the model to learn the relevance of LFs for each input. These unique features lead to considerably improved robustness to the quality of LFs, compared to existing methods. An extensive empirical evaluation on a standard WS benchmark shows that our WS-VAE is competitive to state-of-the-art methods and substantially more robust to LF engineering.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tonolini23a	Francesco Tonolini, Nikolaos Aletras, Yunlong Jiao, Gabriella Kazai
Extending Kernel PCA through Dualization: Sparsity, Robustness and Fast Algorithms	The goal of this paper is to revisit Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) through dualization of a difference of convex functions. This allows to naturally extend KPCA to multiple objective functions and leads to efficient gradient-based algorithms avoiding the expensive SVD of the Gram matrix. Particularly, we consider objective functions that can be written as Moreau envelopes, demonstrating how to promote robustness and sparsity within the same framework. The proposed method is evaluated on synthetic and realworld benchmarks, showing significant speedup in KPCA training time as well as highlighting the benefits in terms of robustness and sparsity.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tonin23a	Francesco Tonin, Alex Lambert, Panagiotis Patrinos, Johan Suykens
Distribution Free Domain Generalization	Accurate prediction of the out-of-distribution data is desired for a learning algorithm. In domain generalization, training data from source domains tend to have different distributions from that of the target domain, while the target data are absence in the training process. We propose a Distribution Free Domain Generalization (DFDG) procedure for classification by conducting standardization to avoid the dominance of a few domains in the training process. The essence of the DFDG is its reformulating the cross domain/class discrepancy by pairwise two sample test statistics, and equally weights their importance or the covariance structures to avoid dominant domain/class. A theoretical generalization bound is established for the multi-class classification problem. The DFDG is shown to offer a superior performance in empirical studies with fewer hyperparameters, which means faster and easier implementation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tong23a	Peifeng Tong, Wu Su, He Li, Jialin Ding, Zhan Haoxiang, Song Xi Chen
Beyond In-Domain Scenarios: Robust Density-Aware Calibration	Calibrating deep learning models to yield uncertainty-aware predictions is crucial as deep neural networks get increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications. While existing post-hoc calibration methods achieve impressive results on in-domain test datasets, they are limited by their inability to yield reliable uncertainty estimates in domain-shift and out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios. We aim to bridge this gap by proposing DAC, an accuracy-preserving as well as Density-Aware Calibration method based on k-nearest-neighbors (KNN). In contrast to existing post-hoc methods, we utilize hidden layers of classifiers as a source for uncertainty-related information and study their importance. We show that DAC is a generic method that can readily be combined with state-of-the-art post-hoc methods. DAC boosts the robustness of calibration performance in domain-shift and OOD, while maintaining excellent in-domain predictive uncertainty estimates. We demonstrate that DAC leads to consistently better calibration across a large number of model architectures, datasets, and metrics. Additionally, we show that DAC improves calibration substantially on recent large-scale neural networks pre-trained on vast amounts of data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tomani23a	Christian Tomani, Futa Kai Waseda, Yuesong Shen, Daniel Cremers

Perturbation Analysis of Neural Collapse	"Training deep neural networks for classification often includes minimizing the training loss beyond the zero training error point. In this phase of training, a ""neural collapse"" behavior has been observed: the variability of features (outputs of the penultimate layer) of within-class samples decreases and the mean features of different classes approach a certain tight frame structure. Recent works analyze this behavior via idealized unconstrained features models where all the minimizers exhibit exact collapse. However, with practical networks and datasets, the features typically do not reach exact collapse, e.g., because deep layers cannot arbitrarily modify intermediate features that are far from being collapsed. In this paper, we propose a richer model that can capture this phenomenon by forcing the features to stay in the vicinity of a predefined features matrix (e.g., intermediate features). We explore the model in the small vicinity case via perturbation analysis and establish results that cannot be obtained by the previously studied models. For example, we prove reduction in the within-class variability of the optimized features compared to the predefined input features (via analyzing gradient flow on the ""central-path"" with minimal assumptions), analyze the minimizers in the near-collapse regime, and provide insights on the effect of regularization hyperparameters on the closeness to collapse. We support our theory with experiments in practical deep learning settings."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tirer23a	Tom Tirer, Haoxiang Huang, Jonathan Niles-Weed

Margin-based sampling in high dimensions: When being active is less efficient than staying passive	It is widely believed that given the same labeling budget, active learning (AL) algorithms like margin-based active learning achieve better predictive performance than passive learning (PL), albeit at a higher computational cost. Recent empirical evidence suggests that this added cost might be in vain, as margin-based AL can sometimes perform even worse than PL. While existing works offer different explanations in the low-dimensional regime, this paper shows that the underlying mechanism is entirely different in high dimensions: we prove for logistic regression that PL outperforms margin-based AL even for noiseless data and when using the Bayes optimal decision boundary for sampling. Insights from our proof indicate that this high-dimensional phenomenon is exacerbated when the separation between the classes is small. We corroborate this intuition with experiments on 20 high-dimensional datasets spanning a diverse range of applications, from finance and histology to chemistry and computer vision.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tifrea23a	Alexandru Tifrea, Jacob Clarysse, Fanny Yang
Fast Rates for Maximum Entropy Exploration	We address the challenge of exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) when the agent operates in an unknown environment with sparse or no rewards. In this work, we study the maximum entropy exploration problem of two different types. The first type is visitation entropy maximization previously considered by Hazan et al. (2019) in the discounted setting. For this type of exploration, we propose a game-theoretic algorithm that has $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^3S^2A/\varepsilon^2)$ sample complexity thus improving the $\varepsilon$-dependence upon existing results, where $S$ is a number of states, $A$ is a number of actions, $H$ is an episode length, and $\varepsilon$ is a desired accuracy. The second type of entropy we study is the trajectory entropy. This objective function is closely related to the entropy-regularized MDPs, and we propose a simple algorithm that has a sample complexity of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathrm{poly}(S,A,H)/\varepsilon)$. Interestingly, it is the first theoretical result in RL literature that establishes the potential statistical advantage of regularized MDPs for exploration. Finally, we apply developed regularization techniques to reduce sample complexity of visitation entropy maximization to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^2SA/\varepsilon^2)$, yielding a statistical separation between maximum entropy exploration and reward-free exploration.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tiapkin23a	Daniil Tiapkin, Denis Belomestny, Daniele Calandriello, Eric Moulines, Remi Munos, Alexey Naumov, Pierre Perrault, Yunhao Tang, Michal Valko, Pierre Menard
Spherical Inducing Features for Orthogonally-Decoupled Gaussian Processes	Despite their many desirable properties, Gaussian processes (GPs) are often compared unfavorably to deep neural networks (NNs) for lacking the ability to learn representations. Recent efforts to bridge the gap between GPs and deep NNs have yielded a new class of inter-domain variational GPs in which the inducing variables correspond to hidden units of a feedforward NN. In this work, we examine some practical issues associated with this approach and propose an extension that leverages the orthogonal decomposition of GPs to mitigate these limitations. In particular, we introduce spherical inter-domain features to construct more flexible data-dependent basis functions for both the principal and orthogonal components of the GP approximation and show that incorporating NN activation features under this framework not only alleviates these shortcomings but is more scalable than alternative strategies. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tiao23a	Louis C. Tiao, Vincent Dutordoir, Victor Picheny
ELSA: Efficient Label Shift Adaptation through the Lens of Semiparametric Models	We study the domain adaptation problem with label shift in this work. Under the label shift context, the marginal distribution of the label varies across the training and testing datasets, while the conditional distribution of features given the label is the same. Traditional label shift adaptation methods either suffer from large estimation errors or require cumbersome post-prediction calibrations. To address these issues, we first propose a moment-matching framework for adapting the label shift based on the geometry of the influence function. Under such a framework, we propose a novel method named $\underline{\mathrm{E}}$fficient $\underline{\mathrm{L}}$abel $\underline{\mathrm{S}}$hift $\underline{\mathrm{A}}$daptation (ELSA), in which the adaptation weights can be estimated by solving linear systems. Theoretically, the ELSA estimator is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent ($n$ is the sample size of the source data) and asymptotically normal. Empirically, we show that ELSA can achieve state-of-the-art estimation performances without post-prediction calibrations, thus, gaining computational efficiency.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tian23a	Qinglong Tian, Xin Zhang, Jiwei Zhao
Target-Aware Generative Augmentations for Single-Shot Adaptation	In this paper, we address the problem of adapting models from a source domain to a target domain, a task that has become increasingly important due to the brittle generalization of deep neural networks. While several test-time adaptation techniques have emerged, they typically rely on synthetic toolbox data augmentations in cases of limited target data availability. We consider the challenging setting of single-shot adaptation and explore the design of augmentation strategies. We argue that augmentations utilized by existing methods are insufficient to handle large distribution shifts, and hence propose a new approach SiSTA, which first fine-tunes a generative model from the source domain using a single-shot target, and then employs novel sampling strategies for curating synthetic target data. Using experiments on a variety of benchmarks, distribution shifts and image corruptions, we find that SiSTA produces significantly improved generalization over existing baselines in face attribute detection and multi-class object recognition. Furthermore, SiSTA performs competitively to models obtained by training on larger target datasets. Our codes can be accessed at https://github.com/Rakshith-2905/SiSTA	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/thopalli23a	Kowshik Thopalli, Rakshith Subramanyam, Pavan K. Turaga, Jayaraman J. Thiagarajan
On the Estimation of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models	This paper revisits Gaussian Mixture Copula Model (GMCM), a more expressive alternative to the widely used Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), with the goal to make its parameter estimation tractable. Both the Expectation Maximization and the direct Likelihood Maximization frameworks for GMCM have to grapple with a likelihood function that lacks a closed form. This has led to a few approximation schemes that alleviate the problem, nonetheless leaving the issue still unresolved. Additionally, past works have alluded to an additional challenge of parameter non-identifiability, but none has offered a rigorous treatment and a commensurate solution framework to overcome the same. This work offers solutions to each of these issues in an attempt to help GMCM realize its full potential. The source of non-identifiability is not only proven but also suitable priors are proposed that eliminate the problem. Additionally, an efficient numerical framework is proposed to evaluate the intractable likelihood function, while also providing its analytical derivatives. Finally, a view of GMCM as a series of bijective mappings from a base distribution is presented, which paves the way to synthesize GMCM using modern, probabilistic programming languages (PPLs). The main claims of this work are supported by empirical evidence gathered on synthetic and real-world datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tewari23a	Ashutosh Tewari
PWSHAP: A Path-Wise Explanation Model for Targeted Variables	Predictive black-box models can exhibit high-accuracy but their opaque nature hinders their uptake in safety-critical deployment environments. Explanation methods (XAI) can provide confidence for decision-making through increased transparency. However, existing XAI methods are not tailored towards models in sensitive domains where one predictor is of special interest, such as a treatment effect in a clinical model, or ethnicity in policy models. We introduce Path-Wise Shapley effects (PWSHAP), a framework for assessing the targeted effect of a binary (e.g. treatment) variable from a complex outcome model. Our approach augments the predictive model with a user-defined directed acyclic graph (DAG). The method then uses the graph alongside on-manifold Shapley values to identify effects along causal pathways whilst maintaining robustness to adversarial attacks. We establish error bounds for the identified path-wise Shapley effects and for Shapley values. We show PWSHAP can perform local bias and mediation analyses with faithfulness to the model. Further, if the targeted variable is randomised we can quantify local effect modification. We demonstrate the resolution, interpretability and true locality of our approach on examples and a real-world experiment.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ter-minassian23a	Lucile Ter-Minassian, Oscar Clivio, Karla Diazordaz, Robin J.

Finding Generalization Measures by Contrasting Signal and Noise	Generalization is one of the most fundamental challenges in deep learning, aiming to predict model performances on unseen data. Empirically, such predictions usually rely on a validation set, while recent works showed that an unlabeled validation set also works. Without validation sets, it is extremely difficult to obtain non-vacuous generalization bounds, which leads to a weaker task of finding generalization measures that monotonically relate to generalization error. In this paper, we propose a new generalization measure REF Complexity (RElative Fitting degree between signal and noise), motivated by the intuition that a given model-algorithm pair may generalize well if it fits signal (e.g., true labels) fast while fitting noise (e.g., random labels) slowly. Empirically, REF Complexity monotonically relates to test accuracy in real-world datasets without accessing additional validation sets, achieving -0.988 correlation on CIFAR-10 and -0.960 correlation on CIFAR-100. We further theoretically verify the utility of REF Complexity under three different cases, including convex and smooth regimes with stochastic gradient descent, smooth regimes (not necessarily convex) with stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, and linear regimes with gradient descent. The code is available at https://github.com/962086838/REF-complexity.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/teng23a	Jiaye Teng, Bohang Zhang, Ruichen Li, Haowei He, Yequan Wang, Yan Tian, Yang Yuan
Concurrent Shuffle Differential Privacy Under Continual Observation	We introduce the concurrent shuffle model of differential privacy. In this model we have multiple concurrent shufflers permuting messages from different, possibly overlapping, batches of users. Similarly to the standard (single) shuffler model, the privacy requirement is that the concatenation of all shuffled messages should be differentially private. We study the private continual summation problem (a.k.a. the counter problem) and show that the concurrent shuffle model allows for significantly improved error compared to a standard (single) shuffler model. Specifically, we give a summation algorithm with error $\tilde{O}(n^{1/(2k+1)})$ with $k$ concurrent shufflers on a sequence of length $n$. Furthermore, we prove that this bound is tight for any $k$, even if the algorithm can choose the sizes of the batches adaptively. For $k=\log n$ shufflers, the resulting error is polylogarithmic, much better than $\tilde{\Theta}(n^{1/3})$ which we show is the smallest possible with a single shuffler. We use our online summation algorithm to get algorithms with improved regret bounds for the contextual linear bandit problem. In particular we get optimal $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ regret with $k= \tilde{\Omega}(\log n)$ concurrent shufflers.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tenenbaum23a	Jay Tenenbaum, Haim Kaplan, Yishay Mansour, Uri Stemmer
How to Trust Your Diffusion Model: A Convex Optimization Approach to Conformal Risk Control	Score-based generative modeling, informally referred to as diffusion models, continue to grow in popularity across several important domains and tasks. While they provide high-quality and diverse samples from empirical distributions, important questions remain on the reliability and trustworthiness of these sampling procedures for their responsible use in critical scenarios. Conformal prediction is a modern tool to construct finite-sample, distribution-free uncertainty guarantees for any black-box predictor. In this work, we focus on image-to-image regression tasks and we present a generalization of the Risk-Controlling Prediction Sets (RCPS) procedure, that we term $K$-RCPS, which allows to $(i)$ provide entrywise calibrated intervals for future samples of any diffusion model, and $(ii)$ control a certain notion of risk with respect to a ground truth image with minimal mean interval length. Differently from existing conformal risk control procedures, ours relies on a novel convex optimization approach that allows for multidimensional risk control while provably minimizing the mean interval length. We illustrate our approach on two real-world image denoising problems: on natural images of faces as well as on computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen, demonstrating state of the art performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/teneggi23a	Jacopo Teneggi, Matthew Tivnan, Web Stayman, Jeremias Sulam
Deep Regression Unlearning	With the introduction of data protection and privacy regulations, it has become crucial to remove the lineage of data on demand from a machine learning (ML) model. In the last few years, there have been notable developments in machine unlearning to remove the information of certain training data efficiently and effectively from ML models. In this work, we explore unlearning for the regression problem, particularly in deep learning models. Unlearning in classification and simple linear regression has been considerably investigated. However, unlearning in deep regression models largely remains an untouched problem till now. In this work, we introduce deep regression unlearning methods that generalize well and are robust to privacy attacks. We propose the Blindspot unlearning method which uses a novel weight optimization process. A randomly initialized model, partially exposed to the retain samples and a copy of the original model are used together to selectively imprint knowledge about the data that we wish to keep and scrub off the information of the data we wish to forget. We also propose a Gaussian fine tuning method for regression unlearning. The existing unlearning metrics for classification are not directly applicable to regression unlearning. Therefore, we adapt these metrics for the regression setting. We conduct regression unlearning experiments for computer vision, natural language processing and forecasting applications. Our methods show excellent performance for all these datasets across all the metrics.

Data Feedback Loops: Model-driven Amplification of Dataset Biases	Datasets scraped from the internet have been critical to large-scale machine learning. Yet, its success puts the utility of future internet-derived datasets at potential risk, as model outputs begin to replace human annotations as a source of supervision. In this work, we formalize a system where interactions with one model are recorded as history and scraped as training data in the future. We then analyze its stability over time by tracking changes to a test-time bias statistic (e.g. gender bias of model predictions). We find that the degree of bias amplification is closely linked to whether the model's outputs behave like samples from the training distribution, a behavior which we characterize and define as uniform faithfulness. Experiments in three conditional prediction scenarios – image classification, visual role-labeling, and language generation – demonstrate that models that exhibit a sampling-like behavior are more faithful and thus more stable. Based on this insight, we propose an intervention to help mitigate and stabilize unstable feedback systems.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/taori23a	Rohan Taori, Tatsunori Hashimoto
Abstract-to-Executable Trajectory Translation for One-Shot Task Generalization	Training long-horizon robotic policies in complex physical environments is essential for many applications, such as robotic manipulation. However, learning a policy that can generalize to unseen tasks is challenging. In this work, we propose to achieve one-shot task generalization by decoupling plan generation and plan execution. Specifically, our method solves complex long-horizon tasks in three steps: build a paired abstract environment by simplifying geometry and physics, generate abstract trajectories, and solve the original task by an abstract-to-executable trajectory translator. In the abstract environment, complex dynamics such as physical manipulation are removed, making abstract trajectories easier to generate. However, this introduces a large domain gap between abstract trajectories and the actual executed trajectories as abstract trajectories lack low-level details and are not aligned frame-to-frame with the executed trajectory. In a manner reminiscent of language translation, our approach leverages a seq-to-seq model to overcome the large domain gap between the abstract and executable trajectories, enabling the low-level policy to follow the abstract trajectory. Experimental results on various unseen long-horizon tasks with different robot embodiments demonstrate the practicability of our methods to achieve one-shot task generalization.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tao23b	Stone Tao, Xiaochen Li, Tongzhou Mu, Zhiao Huang, Yuzhe Qin, Hao Su
Dual Focal Loss for Calibration	The use of deep neural networks in real-world applications require well-calibrated networks with confidence scores that accurately reflect the actual probability. However, it has been found that these networks often provide over-confident predictions, which leads to poor calibration. Recent efforts have sought to address this issue by focal loss to reduce over-confidence, but this approach can also lead to under-confident predictions. While different variants of focal loss have been explored, it is difficult to find a balance between over-confidence and under-confidence. In our work, we propose a new loss function by focusing on dual logits. Our method not only considers the ground truth logit, but also take into account the highest logit ranked after the ground truth logit. By maximizing the gap between these two logits, our proposed dual focal loss can achieve a better balance between over-confidence and under-confidence. We provide theoretical evidence to support our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness through evaluations on multiple models and datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

POUF: Prompt-Oriented Unsupervised Fine-tuning for Large Pre-trained Models	Through prompting, large-scale pre-trained models have become more expressive and powerful, gaining significant attention in recent years. Though these big models have zero-shot capabilities, in general, labeled data are still required to adapt them to downstream tasks. To overcome this critical limitation, we propose an unsupervised fine-tuning framework to directly fine-tune the model or prompt on the unlabeled target data. We demonstrate how to apply our method to both language-augmented vision and masked-language models, by aligning the discrete distributions extracted from the prompts and target data. To verify our approach's applicability, we conduct extensive experiments on image classification, sentiment analysis, and natural language inference tasks. Across 13 image-related tasks and 15 language-related ones, the proposed approach achieves consistent improvements over the baselines. PyTorch code is available at https://github.com/korawat-tanwisuth/POUF.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tanwisuth23a	Korawat Tanwisuth, Shujian Zhang, Huangjie Zheng, Pengcheng He, Mingyuan Zhou
End-to-end Training of Deep Boltzmann Machines by Unbiased Contrastive Divergence with Local Mode Initialization	We address the problem of biased gradient estimation in deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs). The existing method to obtain an unbiased estimator uses a maximal coupling based on a Gibbs sampler, but when the state is high-dimensional, it takes a long time to converge. In this study, we propose to use a coupling based on the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) and to initialize the state around a local mode of the target distribution. Because of the propensity of MH to reject proposals, the coupling tends to converge in only one step with a high probability, leading to high efficiency. We find that our method allows DBMs to be trained in an end-to-end fashion without greedy pretraining. We also propose some practical techniques to further improve the performance of DBMs. We empirically demonstrate that our training algorithm enables DBMs to show comparable generative performance to other deep generative models, achieving the FID score of 10.33 for MNIST.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/taniguchi23a	Shohei Taniguchi, Masahiro Suzuki, Yusuke Iwasawa, Yutaka Matsuo
Difference-in-Differences Meets Tree-based Methods: Heterogeneous Treatment Effects Estimation with Unmeasured Confounding	This study considers the estimation of conditional causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding for a balanced panel with treatment imposed at the last time point. To address this, we combine Difference-in-differences (DiD) and tree-based methods and propose a new identification assumption that allows for the violation of the (conditional) parallel trends assumption adopted by most existing DiD methods. Under this new assumption, we prove partial identifiability of the conditional average treatment effect on the treated group (CATT). Our proposed method estimates CATT through a tree-based causal approach, guided by a novel splitting rule that avoids model misspecification and unnecessary auxiliary parameter estimation. The splitting rule measures both the error of fitting observed data and the violation of conditional parallel trends simultaneously. We also develop an ensemble of multiple trees via gradient boosting to further enhance performance. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tang23j	Caizhi Tang, Huiyuan Wang, Xinyu Li, Qing Cui, Longfei Li, Jun Zhou
Defects of Convolutional Decoder Networks in Frequency Representation	In this paper, we prove the representation defects of a cascaded convolutional decoder network, considering the capacity of representing different frequency components of an input sample. We conduct the discrete Fourier transform on each channel of the feature map in an intermediate layer of the decoder network. Then, we extend the 2D circular convolution theorem to represent the forward and backward propagations through convolutional layers in the frequency domain. Based on this, we prove three defects in representing feature spectrums. First, we prove that the convolution operation, the zero-padding operation, and a set of other settings all make a convolutional decoder network more likely to weaken high-frequency components. Second, we prove that the upsampling operation generates a feature spectrum, in which strong signals repetitively appear at certain frequencies. Third, we prove that if the frequency components in the input sample and frequency components in the target output for regression have a small shift, then the decoder usually cannot be effectively learned.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tang23i	Ling Tang, Wen Shen, Zhanpeng Zhou, Yuefeng Chen, Quanshi Zhang
VA-learning as a more efficient alternative to Q-learning	In reinforcement learning, the advantage function is critical for policy improvement, but is often extracted from a learned Q-function. A natural question is: Why not learn the advantage function directly? In this work, we introduce VA-learning, which directly learns advantage function and value function using bootstrapping, without explicit reference to Q-functions. VA-learning learns off-policy and enjoys similar theoretical guarantees as Q-learning. Thanks to the direct learning of advantage function and value function, VA-learning improves the sample efficiency over Q-learning both in tabular implementations and deep RL agents on Atari-57 games. We also identify a close connection between VA-learning and the dueling architecture, which partially explains why a simple architectural change to DQN agents tends to improve performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tang23h	Yunhao Tang, Remi Munos, Mark Rowland, Michal Valko
Towards a better understanding of representation dynamics under TD-learning	TD-learning is a foundation reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for value prediction. Critical to the accuracy of value predictions is the quality of state representations. In this work, we consider the question: how does end-to-end TD-learning impact the representation over time? Complementary to prior work, we provide a set of analysis that sheds further light on the representation dynamics under TD-learning. We first show that when the environments are reversible, end-to-end TD-learning strictly decreases the value approximation error over time. Under further assumptions on the environments, we can connect the representation dynamics with spectral decomposition over the transition matrix. This latter finding establishes fitting multiple value functions from randomly generated rewards as a useful auxiliary task for representation learning, as we empirically validate on both tabular and Atari game suites.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tang23g	Yunhao Tang, Remi Munos
Towards Understanding Generalization of Graph Neural Networks	Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used in machine learning for graph-structured data. Even though GNNs have achieved remarkable success in real-world applications, understanding their working mechanism in theory is still on primary stage. In this paper, we move towards this goal from the perspective of generalization. Specifically, with consideration of stochastic optimization, we establish high probability bounds of generalization gap and gradients for transductive learning algorithms. After that, we provide high probability bounds of generalization gap for popular GNNs and analyze the factors affecting their generalization capability. These theoretical results reveal how the network architecture impacts the generalization gap. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate the theoretical findings. Our results provide new insights into understanding generalization of GNNs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tang23f	Huayi Tang, Yong Liu
DoMo-AC: Doubly Multi-step Off-policy Actor-Critic Algorithm	Multi-step learning applies lookahead over multiple time steps and has proved valuable in policy evaluation settings. However, in the optimal control case, the impact of multi-step learning has been relatively limited despite a number of prior efforts. Fundamentally, this might be because multi-step policy improvements require operations that cannot be approximated by stochastic samples, hence hindering the widespread adoption of such methods in practice. To address such limitations, we introduce doubly multi-step off-policy VI (DoMo-VI), a novel oracle algorithm that combines multi-step policy improvements and policy evaluations. DoMo-VI enjoys guaranteed convergence speed-up to the optimal policy and is applicable in general off-policy learning settings. We then propose doubly multi-step off-policy actor-critic (DoMo-AC), a practical instantiation of the DoMo-VI algorithm. DoMo-AC introduces a bias-variance trade-off that ensures improved policy gradient estimates. When combined with the IMPALA architecture, DoMo-AC has showed improvements over the baseline algorithm on Atari-57 game benchmarks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tang23e	Yunhao Tang, Tadashi Kozuno, Mark Rowland, Anna Harutyunyan, Remi Munos, Bernardo Avila Pires, Michal Valko
Understanding Self-Predictive Learning for Reinforcement Learning	We study the learning dynamics of self-predictive learning for reinforcement learning, a family of algorithms that learn representations by minimizing the prediction error of their own future latent representations. Despite its recent empirical success, such algorithms have an apparent defect: trivial representations (such as constants) minimize the prediction error, yet it is obviously undesirable to converge to such solutions. Our central insight is that careful designs of the optimization dynamics are critical to learning meaningful representations. We identify that a faster paced optimization of the predictor and semi-gradient updates on the representation, are crucial to preventing the representation collapse. Then in an idealized setup, we show self-predictive learning dynamics carries out spectral decomposition on the state transition matrix, effectively capturing information of the transition dynamics. Building on the theoretical insights, we propose bidirectional self-predictive learning, a novel self-predictive algorithm that learns two representations simultaneously. We examine the robustness of our theoretical insights with a number of small-scale experiments and showcase the promise of the novel representation learning algorithm with large-scale experiments.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tang23d	Yunhao Tang, Zhaohan Daniel Guo, Pierre Harvey Richemond, Bernardo Avila Pires, Yash Chandak, Remi Munos, Mark Rowland, Mohammad Gheshlaghi Azar, Charline Le Lan, Clare Lyle, András György, Shantanu Thakoor, Will Dabney, Bilal Piot, Daniele Calandriello, Michal Valko
From Perception to Programs: Regularize, Overparameterize, and Amortize	We develop techniques for synthesizing neurosymbolic programs. Such programs mix discrete symbolic processing with continuous neural computation. We relax this mixed discrete/continuous problem and jointly learn all modules with gradient descent, and also incorporate amortized inference, overparameterization, and a differentiable strategy for penalizing lengthy programs. Collectedly this toolbox improves the stability of gradient-guided program search, and suggests ways of learning both how to parse continuous input into discrete abstractions, and how to process those abstractions via symbolic code.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tang23c	Hao Tang, Kevin Ellis
Regret-Minimizing Double Oracle for Extensive-Form Games	By incorporating regret minimization, double oracle methods have demonstrated rapid convergence to Nash Equilibrium (NE) in normal-form games and extensive-form games, through algorithms such as online double oracle (ODO) and extensive-form double oracle (XDO), respectively. In this study, we further examine the theoretical convergence rate and sample complexity of such regret minimization-based double oracle methods, utilizing a unified framework called Regret-Minimizing Double Oracle. Based on this framework, we extend ODO to extensive-form games and determine its sample complexity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the sample complexity of XDO can be exponential in the number of information sets $|S|$, owing to the exponentially decaying stopping threshold of restricted games. To solve this problem, we propose the Periodic Double Oracle (PDO) method, which has the lowest sample complexity among regret minimization-based double oracle methods, being only polynomial in $|S|$. Empirical evaluations on multiple poker and board games show that PDO achieves significantly faster convergence than previous double oracle algorithms and reaches a competitive level with state-of-the-art regret minimization methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tang23b	Xiaohang Tang, Le Cong Dinh, Stephen Marcus Mcaleer, Yaodong Yang
Auto-Differentiation of Relational Computations for Very Large Scale Machine Learning	The relational data model was designed to facilitate large-scale data management and analytics.

Provably Invariant Learning without Domain Information	Typical machine learning applications always assume the data follows independent and identically distributed (IID) assumptions. In contrast, this assumption is frequently violated in real-world circumstances, leading to the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization problem and a major drop in model robustness. To mitigate this issue, the invariant learning technique is leveraged to distinguish between spurious features and invariant features among all input features and to train the model purely on the basis of the invariant features. Numerous invariant learning strategies imply that the training data should contain domain information. Such information includes the environment index or auxiliary information acquired from prior knowledge. However, acquiring these information is typically impossible in practice. In this study, we present TIVA for environment-independent invariance learning, which requires no environment-specific information in training data. We discover and prove that, given certain mild data conditions, it is possible to train an environment partitioning policy based on attributes that are independent of the targets and then conduct invariant risk minimization. We examine our method in comparison to other baseline methods, which demonstrate superior performance and excellent robustness under OOD, using multiple benchmarks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tan23b	Xiaoyu Tan, Lin Yong, Shengyu Zhu, Chao Qu, Xihe Qiu, Xu Yinghui, Peng Cui, Yuan Qi
Robust Explanation for Free or At the Cost of Faithfulness	Devoted to interpreting the explicit behaviors of machine learning models, explanation methods can identify implicit characteristics of models to improve trustworthiness. However, explanation methods are shown as vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, implying security concerns in high-stakes domains.

Therefore, we can have robust explanations for	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tan23a	Zeren Tan, Yang Tian
Towards Practical Preferential Bayesian Optimization with Skew Gaussian Processes	We study preferential Bayesian optimization (BO) where reliable feedback is limited to pairwise comparison called duels. An important challenge in preferential BO, which uses the preferential Gaussian process (GP) model to represent flexible preference structure, is that the posterior distribution is a computationally intractable skew GP. The most widely used approach for preferential BO is Gaussian approximation, which ignores the skewness of the true posterior. Alternatively, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based preferential BO is also proposed. In this work, we first verify the accuracy of Gaussian approximation, from which we reveal the critical problem that the predictive probability of duels can be inaccurate. This observation motivates us to improve the MCMC-based estimation for skew GP, for which we show the practical efficiency of Gibbs sampling and derive the low variance MC estimator. However, the computational time of MCMC can still be a bottleneck in practice. Towards building a more practical preferential BO, we develop a new method that achieves both high computational efficiency and low sample complexity, and then demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive numerical experiments.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/takeno23b	Shion Takeno, Masahiro Nomura, Masayuki Karasuyama
Randomized Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound with Tighter Bayesian Regret Bounds	Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) is a theoretically promising approach for black-box optimization; however, the confidence parameter $\beta$ is considerably large in the theorem and chosen heuristically in practice. Then, randomized GP-UCB (RGP-UCB) uses a randomized confidence parameter, which follows the Gamma distribution, to mitigate the impact of manually specifying $\beta$. This study first generalizes the regret analysis of RGP-UCB to a wider class of distributions, including the Gamma distribution. Furthermore, we propose improved RGP-UCB (IRGP-UCB) based on a two-parameter exponential distribution, which achieves tighter Bayesian regret bounds. IRGP-UCB does not require an increase in the confidence parameter in terms of the number of iterations, which avoids over-exploration in the later iterations. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of IRGP-UCB through extensive experiments.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/takeno23a	Shion Takeno, Yu Inatsu, Masayuki Karasuyama
Contextual Conservative Interleaving Bandits	The performance of a bandit algorithm is usually measured by the cumulative rewards of the actions chosen by the algorithm. However, in many real-world applications, the rewards in each round should be good enough for reasons such as safety and fairness. In this paper, we investigate the contextual conservative interleaving bandit problem, which has a performance constraint that requires the chosen actions to be not much worse than given baseline actions in each round. This work is the first to simultaneously consider the following practical situations: (1) multiple actions are chosen in a round, (2) the feature vectors associated with given actions depend on the round, and (3) the performance constraints in each round that depend only on the actions chosen in that round. We propose a meta-algorithm, Greedy on Confidence Widths (GCW), that satisfies the performance constraints with high probability. GCW uses a standard bandit algorithm and achieves minimax optimal regret up to logarithmic factors if the algorithm used is also minimax optimal. We improve the existing analyses for the C${}^2$UCB algorithm and the Thompson sampling to combine with GCW. We show that these algorithms achieve near-optimal regret when the feasible sets of given actions are the bases of a matroid.

Learning Neural PDE Solvers with Parameter-Guided Channel Attention	Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) is concerned with the development of learned emulators of physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDE). In application domains such as weather forecasting, molecular dynamics, and inverse design, ML-based surrogate models are increasingly used to augment or replace inefficient and often non-differentiable numerical simulation algorithms. While a number of ML-based methods for approximating the solutions of PDEs have been proposed in recent years, they typically do not adapt to the parameters of the PDEs, making it difficult to generalize to PDE parameters not seen during training. We propose a Channel Attention guided by PDE Parameter Embeddings (CAPE) component for neural surrogate models and a simple yet effective curriculum learning strategy. The CAPE module can be combined with any neural PDE solvers allowing them to adapt to unseen PDE parameters. The curriculum learning strategy provides a seamless transition between teacher-forcing and fully auto-regressive training. We compare CAPE in conjunction with the curriculum learning strategy using a PDE benchmark and obtain consistent and significant improvements over the baseline models. The experiments also show several advantages of CAPE, such as its increased ability to generalize to unseen PDE parameters without large increases inference time and parameter count. An implementation of the method and experiments are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CAPE-ML4Sci-145B.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/takamoto23a	Makoto Takamoto, Francesco Alesiani, Mathias Niepert
Approximation and Estimation Ability of Transformers for Sequence-to-Sequence Functions with Infinite Dimensional Input	Despite the great success of Transformer networks in various applications such as natural language processing and computer vision, their theoretical aspects are not well understood. In this paper, we study the approximation and estimation ability of Transformers as sequence-to-sequence functions with infinite dimensional inputs. Although inputs and outputs are both infinite dimensional, we show that when the target function has anisotropic smoothness, Transformers can avoid the curse of dimensionality due to their feature extraction ability and parameter sharing property. In addition, we show that even if the smoothness changes depending on each input, Transformers can estimate the importance of features for each input and extract important features dynamically. Then, we proved that Transformers achieve similar convergence rate as in the case of the fixed smoothness. Our theoretical results support the practical success of Transformers for high dimensional data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/takakura23a	Shokichi Takakura, Taiji Suzuki
Learning Mixtures of Gaussians with Censored Data	We study the problem of learning mixtures of Gaussians with censored data. Statistical learning with censored data is a classical problem, with numerous practical applications, however, finite-sample guarantees for even simple latent variable models such as Gaussian mixtures are missing. Formally, we are given censored data from a mixture of univariate Gaussians $ \sum_{i=1}^k w_i \mathcal{N}(\mu_i,\sigma^2), $ i.e. the sample is observed only if it lies inside a set $S$. The goal is to learn the weights $w_i$ and the means $\mu_i$. We propose an algorithm that takes only $\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{O(k)}}$ samples to estimate the weights $w_i$ and the means $\mu_i$ within $\varepsilon$ error.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/tai23a	Wai Ming Tai, Bryon Aragam
MG-GNN: Multigrid Graph Neural Networks for Learning Multilevel Domain Decomposition Methods	Domain decomposition methods (DDMs) are popular solvers for discretized systems of partial differential equations (PDEs), with one-level and multilevel variants. These solvers rely on several algorithmic and mathematical parameters, prescribing overlap, subdomain boundary conditions, and other properties of the DDM. While some work has been done on optimizing these parameters, it has mostly focused on the one-level setting or special cases such as structured-grid discretizations with regular subdomain construction. In this paper, we propose multigrid graph neural networks (MG-GNN), a novel GNN architecture for learning optimized parameters in two-level DDMs. We train MG-GNN using a new unsupervised loss function, enabling effective training on small problems that yields robust performance on unstructured grids that are orders of magnitude larger than those in the training set. We show that MG-GNN outperforms popular hierarchical graph network architectures for this optimization and that our proposed loss function is critical to achieving this improved performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/taghibakhshi23a	Ali Taghibakhshi, Nicolas Nytko, Tareq Uz Zaman, Scott Maclachlan, Luke Olson, Matthew West
Adaptive Coordination in Social Embodied Rearrangement	"We present the task of ""Social Rearrangement"", consisting of cooperative everyday tasks like setting up the dinner table, tidying a house or unpacking groceries in a simulated multi-agent environment. In Social Rearrangement, two robots coordinate to complete a long-horizon task, using onboard sensing and egocentric observations, and no privileged information about the environment. We study zero-shot coordination (ZSC) in this task, where an agent collaborates with a new partner, emulating a scenario where a robot collaborates with a new human partner. Prior ZSC approaches struggle to generalize in our complex and visually rich setting, and on further analysis, we find that they fail to generate diverse coordination behaviors at training time. To counter this, we propose Behavior Diversity Play (BDP), a novel ZSC approach that encourages diversity through a discriminability objective. Our results demonstrate that BDP learns adaptive agents that can tackle visual coordination, and zero-shot generalize to new partners in unseen environments, achieving 35% higher success and 32% higher efficiency compared to baselines."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/szot23a	Andrew Szot, Unnat Jain, Dhruv Batra, Zsolt Kira, Ruta Desai, Akshara Rai
Optimal randomized multilevel Monte Carlo for repeatedly nested expectations	"The estimation of repeatedly nested expectations is a challenging task that arises in many real-world systems. However, existing methods generally suffer from high computational costs when the number of nestings becomes large. Fix any non-negative integer $D$ for the total number of nestings. Standard Monte Carlo methods typically cost at least $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-(2+D)})$ and sometimes $\mathcal {O}(\varepsilon^{-2(1+D)})$ to obtain an estimator up to $\varepsilon$-error. More advanced methods, such as multilevel Monte Carlo, currently only exist for $D = 1$. In this paper, we propose a novel Monte Carlo estimator called $\mathsf{READ}$, which stands for ""Recursive Estimator for Arbitrary Depth."" Our estimator has an optimal computational cost of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ for every fixed $D$ under suitable assumptions, and a nearly optimal computational cost of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2(1 + \delta)})$ for any $0 < \delta < \frac12$ under much more general assumptions. Our estimator is also unbiased, which makes it easy to parallelize. The key ingredients in our construction are an observation of the problem's recursive structure and the recursive use of the randomized multilevel Monte Carlo method."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/syed23a	Yasa Syed, Guanyang Wang
Von Mises Mixture Distributions for Molecular Conformation Generation	Molecules are frequently represented as graphs, but the underlying 3D molecular geometry (the locations of the atoms) ultimately determines most molecular properties. However, most molecules are not static and at room temperature adopt a wide variety of geometries or $\textit{conformations}$. The resulting distribution on geometries $p(x)$ is known as the Boltzmann distribution, and many molecular properties are expectations computed under this distribution. Generating accurate samples from the Boltzmann distribution is therefore essential for computing these expectations accurately. Traditional sampling-based methods are computationally expensive, and most recent machine learning-based methods have focused on identifying $\textit{modes}$ in this distribution rather than generating true $\textit{samples}$. Generating such samples requires capturing conformational variability, and it has been widely recognized that the majority of conformational variability in molecules arises from rotatable bonds. In this work, we present VonMisesNet, a new graph neural network that captures conformational variability via a variational approximation of rotatable bond torsion angles as a mixture of von Mises distributions. We demonstrate that VonMisesNet can generate conformations for arbitrary molecules in a way that is both physically accurate with respect to the Boltzmann distribution and orders of magnitude faster than existing sampling methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/swanson23a	Kirk Swanson, Jake Lawrence Williams, Eric M Jonas
Inverse Reinforcement Learning without Reinforcement Learning	Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is a powerful set of techniques for imitation learning that aims to learn a reward function that rationalizes expert demonstrations. Unfortunately, traditional IRL methods suffer from a computational weakness: they require repeatedly solving a hard reinforcement learning (RL) problem as a subroutine. This is counter-intuitive from the viewpoint of reductions: we have reduced the	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/swamy23a	Gokul Swamy, David Wu, Sanjiban Choudhury, Drew Bagnell, Steven Wu
Proximal Causal Learning of Conditional Average Treatment Effects	Efficiently and flexibly estimating treatment effect heterogeneity is an important task in a wide variety of settings ranging from medicine to marketing, and there are a considerable number of promising conditional average treatment effect estimators currently available. These, however, typically rely on the assumption that the measured covariates are enough to justify conditional exchangeability. We propose the P-learner, motivated by the R- and DR-learner, a tailored two-stage loss function for learning heterogeneous treatment effects in settings where exchangeability given observed covariates is an implausible assumption, and we wish to rely on proxy variables for causal inference. Our proposed estimator can be implemented by off-the-shelf loss-minimizing machine learning methods, which in the case of kernel regression satisfies an oracle bound on the estimated error as long as the nuisance components are estimated reasonably well.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sverdrup23a	Erik Sverdrup, Yifan Cui
Tight and fast generalization error bound of graph embedding in metric space	Recent studies have experimentally shown that we can achieve in non-Euclidean metric space effective and efficient graph embedding, which aims to obtain the vertices' representations reflecting the graph's structure in the metric space. Specifically, graph embedding in hyperbolic space has experimentally succeeded in embedding graphs with hierarchical-tree structure, e.g., data in natural languages, social networks, and knowledge bases. However, recent theoretical analyses have shown a much higher upper bound on non-Euclidean graph embedding's generalization error than Euclidean one's, where a high generalization error indicates that the incompleteness and noise in the data can significantly damage learning performance. It implies that the existing bound cannot guarantee the success of graph embedding in non-Euclidean metric space in a practical training data size, which can prevent non-Euclidean graph embedding's application in real problems. This paper provides a novel upper bound of graph embedding's generalization error by evaluating the local Rademacher complexity of the model as a function set of the distances of representation couples. Our bound clarifies that the performance of graph embedding in non-Euclidean metric space, including hyperbolic space, is better than the existing upper bounds suggest. Specifically, our new upper bound is polynomial in the metric space's geometric radius $R$ and can be $O(\frac{1}{S})$ at the fastest, where $S$ is the training data size. Our bound is significantly tighter and faster than the existing one, which can be exponential to $R$ and $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{S}})$ at the fastest. Specific calculations on example cases show that graph embedding in non-Euclidean metric space can outperform that in Euclidean space with much smaller training data than the existing bound has suggested.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/suzuki23a	Atsushi Suzuki, Atsushi Nitanda, Taiji Suzuki, Jing Wang, Feng Tian, Kenji Yamanishi
Beyond Exponentially Fast Mixing in Average-Reward Reinforcement Learning via Multi-Level Monte Carlo Actor-Critic	Many existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods employ stochastic gradient iteration on the back end, whose stability hinges upon a hypothesis that the data-generating process mixes exponentially fast with a rate parameter that appears in the step-size selection. Unfortunately, this assumption is violated for large state spaces or settings with sparse rewards, and the mixing time is unknown, making the step size inoperable. In this work, we propose an RL methodology attuned to the mixing time by employing a multi-level Monte Carlo estimator for the critic, the actor, and the average reward embedded within an actor-critic (AC) algorithm. This method, which we call	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/suttle23a	Wesley A Suttle, Amrit Bedi, Bhrij Patel, Brian M. Sadler, Alec Koppel, Dinesh Manocha
Tuning Computer Vision Models With Task Rewards	Misalignment between model predictions and intended usage can be detrimental for the deployment of computer vision models. The issue is exacerbated when the task involves complex structured outputs, as it becomes harder to design procedures which address this misalignment. In natural language processing, this is often addressed using reinforcement learning techniques that align models with a task reward. We adopt this approach and show its surprising effectiveness to improve generic models pretrained to imitate example outputs across multiple computer vision tasks, such as object detection, panoptic segmentation, colorization and image captioning. We believe this approach has the potential to be widely useful for better aligning models with a diverse range of computer vision tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/susano-pinto23a	André Susano Pinto, Alexander Kolesnikov, Yuge Shi, Lucas Beyer, Xiaohua Zhai

Inflow, Outflow, and Reciprocity in Machine Learning	Data is pooled across entities (individuals or enterprises) to create machine learning models, and sometimes, the entities that contribute the data also benefit from the models. Consider for instance a recommender system (e.g. Spotify, Instagram or YouTube), a health care app that predicts the risk for some disease, or a service built by pooling data across enterprises. In this work we propose a framework to study this value exchange, i.e., we model and measure contributions (outflows), benefits (inflows) and the balance between contributions and benefits (the degree of reciprocity). We show theoretically, and via experiments that under certain distributional assumptions, some classes of models are approximately reciprocal. These results only scratch the surface; we conclude with several open directions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sundararajan23a	Mukund Sundararajan, Walid Krichene
Model-Bellman Inconsistency for Model-based Offline Reinforcement Learning	For offline reinforcement learning (RL), model-based methods are expected to be data-efficient as they incorporate dynamics models to generate more data. However, due to inevitable model errors, straightforwardly learning a policy in the model typically fails in the offline setting. Previous studies have incorporated conservatism to prevent out-of-distribution exploration. For example, MOPO penalizes rewards through uncertainty measures from predicting the next states, which we have discovered are loose bounds of the ideal uncertainty, i.e., the Bellman error. In this work, we propose MOdel-Bellman Inconsistency penalized offLinE Policy Optimization (MOBILE), a novel uncertainty-driven offline RL algorithm. MOBILE conducts uncertainty quantification through the inconsistency of Bellman estimations under an ensemble of learned dynamics models, which can be a better approximator to the true Bellman error, and penalizes the Bellman estimation based on this uncertainty. Empirically we have verified that our proposed uncertainty quantification can be significantly closer to the true Bellman error than the compared methods. Consequently, MOBILE outperforms prior offline RL approaches on most tasks of D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sun23q	Yihao Sun, Jiaji Zhang, Chengxing Jia, Haoxin Lin, Junyin Ye, Yang Yu
Feature Expansion for Graph Neural Networks	Graph neural networks aim to learn representations for graph-structured data and show impressive performance in node classification. Recently, many methods have studied the representations of GNNs from the perspective of optimization goals and spectral graph theory. However, the feature space that dominates representation learning has not been systematically studied in graph neural networks. In this paper, we propose to fill this gap by analyzing the feature space of both spatial and spectral models. We decompose graph neural networks into determined feature spaces and trainable weights, providing the convenience of studying the feature space explicitly using matrix space analysis. In particular, we find theoretically that the feature space tends to be linearly correlated due to repeated aggregations. In this case, the feature space is bounded by the poor representation of shared weights or the limited dimensionality of node attributes in existing models, leading to poor performance. Motivated by these findings, we propose 1) feature subspaces flattening and 2) structural principal components to expand the feature space. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed more comprehensive feature space, with comparable inference time to the baseline, and demonstrate its efficient convergence capability.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sun23p	Jiaqi Sun, Lin Zhang, Guangyi Chen, Peng Xu, Kun Zhang, Yujiu Yang
A Neural PDE Solver with Temporal Stencil Modeling	Numerical simulation of non-linear partial differential equations plays a crucial role in modeling physical science and engineering phenomena, such as weather, climate, and aerodynamics. Recent Machine Learning (ML) models trained on low-resolution spatio-temporal signals have shown new promises in capturing important dynamics in high-resolution signals, under the condition that the models can effectively recover the missing details. However, this study shows that significant information is often lost in the low-resolution down-sampled features. To address such issues, we propose a new approach, namely Temporal Stencil Modeling (TSM), which combines the strengths of advanced time-series sequence modeling (with the HiPPO features) and state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers (with learnable stencil modeling). TSM aims to recover the lost information from the PDE trajectories and can be regarded as a temporal generalization of classic finite volume methods such as WENO. Our experimental results show that TSM achieves the new state-of-the-art simulation accuracy for 2-D incompressible Navier-Stokes turbulent flows: it significantly outperforms the previously reported best results by 19.9% in terms of the highly-correlated duration time, and reduces the inference latency into 80%. We also show a strong generalization ability of the proposed method to various out-of-distribution turbulent flow settings, as well as lower resolution or 1-D / 3-D settings.

SDDM: Score-Decomposed Diffusion Models on Manifolds for Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation	"Recent score-based diffusion models (SBDMs) show promising results in unpaired image-to-image translation (I2I). However, existing methods, either energy-based or statistically-based, provide no explicit form of the interfered intermediate generative distributions. This work presents a new score-decomposed diffusion model (SDDM) on manifolds to explicitly optimize the tangled distributions during image generation. SDDM derives manifolds to make the distributions of adjacent time steps separable and decompose the score function or energy guidance into an image ""denoising"" part and a content ""refinement"" part. To refine the image in the same noise level, we equalize the refinement parts of the score function and energy guidance, which permits multi-objective optimization on the manifold. We also leverage the block adaptive instance normalization module to construct manifolds with lower dimensions but still concentrated with the perturbed reference image. SDDM outperforms existing SBDM-based methods with much fewer diffusion steps on several I2I benchmarks."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sun23n	Shikun Sun, Longhui Wei, Junliang Xing, Jia Jia, Qi Tian
A Critical Revisit of Adversarial Robustness in 3D Point Cloud Recognition with Diffusion-Driven Purification	3D point clouds serve as a crucial data representation in numerous real-world applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging. While the advancements in deep learning have spurred the utilization of 3D point clouds, deep models are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Various defense solutions have been proposed to build robust models against adversarial attacks. In this work, we pinpoint a major limitation of the leading empirical defense, adversarial training, when applied to 3D point cloud models: gradient obfuscation, which significantly hampers robustness against potent attacks. To bridge the gap, we propose PointDP, a purification strategy that leverages diffusion models to defend against 3D adversarial attacks. Since PointDP does not rely on predefined adversarial examples for training, it can defend against a variety of threats. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of PointDP across six representative 3D point cloud architectures, employing sixteen strong and adaptive attacks to manifest its foundational robustness. Our evaluation shows that PointDP achieves significantly better (i.e., 12.6%-40.3%) adversarial robustness than state-of-the-art methods under strong attacks bounded by different $\ell_p$ norms.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sun23m	Jiachen Sun, Jiongxiao Wang, Weili Nie, Zhiding Yu, Zhuoqing Mao, Chaowei Xiao
Momentum Ensures Convergence of SIGNSGD under Weaker Assumptions	Sign Stochastic Gradient Descent (signSGD) is a communication-efficient stochastic algorithm that only uses the sign information of the stochastic gradient to update the model's weights. However, the existing convergence theory of signSGD either requires increasing batch sizes during training or assumes the gradient noise is symmetric and unimodal. Error feedback has been used to guarantee the convergence of signSGD under weaker assumptions at the cost of communication overhead. This paper revisits the convergence of signSGD and proves that momentum can remedy signSGD under weaker assumptions than previous techniques; in particular, our convergence theory does not require the assumption of bounded stochastic gradient or increased batch size. Our results resonate with echoes of previous empirical results where, unlike signSGD, signSGD with momentum maintains good performance even with small batch sizes. Another new result is that signSGD with momentum can achieve an improved convergence rate when the objective function is second-order smooth. We further extend our theory to signSGD with major vote and federated learning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sun23l	Tao Sun, Qingsong Wang, Dongsheng Li, Bao Wang
All in a Row: Compressed Convolution Networks for Graphs	Compared to Euclidean convolution, existing graph convolution methods generally fail to learn diverse convolution operators under limited parameter scales and depend on additional treatments of multi-scale feature extraction. The challenges of generalizing Euclidean convolution to graphs arise from the irregular structure of graphs. To bridge the gap between Euclidean space and graph space, we propose a differentiable method for regularization on graphs that applies permutations to the input graphs. The permutations constrain all nodes in a row regardless of their input order and therefore enable the flexible generalization of Euclidean convolution. Based on the regularization of graphs, we propose Compressed Convolution Network (CoCN) for hierarchical graph representation learning. CoCN follows the local feature learning and global parameter sharing mechanisms of Convolution Neural Networks. The whole model can be trained end-to-end and is able to learn both individual node features and the corresponding structure features. We validate CoCN on several node classification and graph classification benchmarks. CoCN achieves superior performance over competitive convolutional GNNs and graph pooling models. Codes are available at https://github.com/sunjss/CoCN.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sun23k	Junshu Sun, Shuhui Wang, Xinzhe Han, Zhe Xue, Qingming Huang
Learning Prescriptive ReLU Networks	We study the problem of learning optimal policy from a set of discrete treatment options using observational data. We propose a piecewise linear neural network model that can balance strong prescriptive performance and interpretability, which we refer to as the prescriptive ReLU network, or P-ReLU. We show analytically that this model (i) partitions the input space into disjoint polyhedra, where all instances that belong to the same partition receive the same treatment, and (ii) can be converted into an equivalent prescriptive tree with hyperplane splits for interpretability. We demonstrate the flexibility of the P-ReLU network as constraints can be easily incorporated with minor modifications to the architecture. Through experiments, we validate the superior prescriptive accuracy of P-ReLU against competing benchmarks. Lastly, we present examples of prescriptive trees extracted from trained P-ReLUs using a real-world dataset, for both the unconstrained and constrained scenarios.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sun23j	Wei Sun, Asterios Tsiourvas
When and How Does Known Class Help Discover Unknown Ones? Provable Understanding Through Spectral Analysis	Novel Class Discovery (NCD) aims at inferring novel classes in an unlabeled set by leveraging prior knowledge from a labeled set with known classes. Despite its importance, there is a lack of theoretical foundations for NCD. This paper bridges the gap by providing an analytical framework to formalize and investigate when and how known classes can help discover novel classes. Tailored to the NCD problem, we introduce a graph-theoretic representation that can be learned by a novel NCD Spectral Contrastive Loss (NSCL). Minimizing this objective is equivalent to factorizing the graph's adjacency matrix, which allows us to derive a provable error bound and provide the sufficient and necessary condition for NCD. Empirically, NSCL can match or outperform several strong baselines on common benchmark datasets, which is appealing for practical usage while enjoying theoretical guarantees.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sun23i	Yiyou Sun, Zhenmei Shi, Yingyu Liang, Yixuan Li
Dynamic Regularized Sharpness Aware Minimization in Federated Learning: Approaching Global Consistency and Smooth Landscape	In federated learning (FL), a cluster of local clients are chaired under the coordination of the global server and cooperatively train one model with privacy protection. Due to the multiple local updates and the isolated non-iid dataset, clients are prone to overfit into their own optima, which extremely deviates from the global objective and significantly undermines the performance. Most previous works only focus on enhancing the consistency between the local and global objectives to alleviate this prejudicial client drifts from the perspective of the optimization view, whose performance would be prominently deteriorated on the high heterogeneity. In this work, we propose a novel and general algorithm FedSMOO by jointly considering the optimization and generalization targets to efficiently improve the performance in FL. Concretely, FedSMOO adopts a dynamic regularizer to guarantee the local optima towards the global objective, which is meanwhile revised by the global Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) optimizer to search for the consistent flat minima. Our theoretical analysis indicates that FedSMOO achieves fast $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ convergence rate with low generalization bound. Extensive numerical studies are conducted on the real-world dataset to verify its peerless efficiency and excellent generality.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sun23h	Yan Sun, Li Shen, Shixiang Chen, Liang Ding, Dacheng Tao
MABe22: A Multi-Species Multi-Task Benchmark for Learned Representations of Behavior	We introduce MABe22, a large-scale, multi-agent video and trajectory benchmark to assess the quality of learned behavior representations. This dataset is collected from a variety of biology experiments, and includes triplets of interacting mice (4.7 million frames video+pose tracking data, 10 million frames pose only), symbiotic beetle-ant interactions (10 million frames video data), and groups of interacting flies (4.4 million frames of pose tracking data). Accompanying these data, we introduce a panel of real-life downstream analysis tasks to assess the quality of learned representations by evaluating how well they preserve information about the experimental conditions (e.g. strain, time of day, optogenetic stimulation) and animal behavior. We test multiple state-of-the-art self-supervised video and trajectory representation learning methods to demonstrate the use of our benchmark, revealing that methods developed using human action datasets do not fully translate to animal datasets. We hope that our benchmark and dataset encourage a broader exploration of behavior representation learning methods across species and settings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sun23g	Jennifer J.

Tensor Gaussian Process with Contraction for Multi-Channel Imaging Analysis	Multi-channel imaging data is a prevalent data format in scientific fields such as astronomy and biology. The structured information and the high dimensionality of these 3-D tensor data makes the analysis an intriguing but challenging topic for statisticians and practitioners. The low-rank scalar-on-tensor regression model, in particular, has received widespread attention and has been re-formulated as a tensor Gaussian Process (Tensor-GP) model with multi-linear kernel in Yu et al. (2018). In this paper, we extend the Tensor-GP model by introducing an integrative dimensionality reduction technique, called tensor contraction, with a Tensor-GP for a scalar-on-tensor regression task with multi-channel imaging data. This is motivated by the solar flare forecasting problem with high dimensional multi-channel imaging data. We first estimate a latent, reduced-size tensor for each data tensor and then apply a multi-linear Tensor-GP on the latent tensor data for prediction. We introduce an anisotropic total-variation regularization when conducting the tensor contraction to obtain a sparse and smooth latent tensor. We then propose an alternating proximal gradient descent algorithm for estimation. We validate our approach via extensive simulation studies and applying it to the solar flare forecasting problem.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sun23f	Hu Sun, Ward Manchester, Meng Jin, Yang Liu, Yang Chen
Maximum Optimality Margin: A Unified Approach for Contextual Linear Programming and Inverse Linear Programming	In this paper, we study the predict-then-optimize problem where the output of a machine learning prediction task is used as the input of some downstream optimization problem, say, the objective coefficient vector of a linear program. The problem is also known as predictive analytics or contextual linear programming. The existing approaches largely suffer from either (i) optimization intractability (a non-convex objective function)/statistical inefficiency (a suboptimal generalization bound) or (ii) requiring strong condition(s) such as no constraint or loss calibration. We develop a new approach to the problem called maximum optimality margin which designs the machine learning loss function by the optimality condition of the downstream optimization. The max-margin formulation enjoys both computational efficiency and good theoretical properties for the learning procedure. More importantly, our new approach only needs the observations of the optimal solution in the training data rather than the objective function, which makes it a new and natural approach to the inverse linear programming problem under both contextual and context-free settings; we also analyze the proposed method under both offline and online settings, and demonstrate its performance using numerical experiments.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sun23e	Chunlin Sun, Shang Liu, Xiaocheng Li
What Makes Entities Similar? A Similarity Flooding Perspective for Multi-sourced Knowledge Graph Embeddings	Joint representation learning over multi-sourced knowledge graphs (KGs) yields transferable and expressive embeddings that improve downstream tasks. Entity alignment (EA) is a critical step in this process. Despite recent considerable research progress in embedding-based EA, how it works remains to be explored. In this paper, we provide a similarity flooding perspective to explain existing translation-based and aggregation-based EA models. We prove that the embedding learning process of these models actually seeks a fixpoint of pairwise similarities between entities. We also provide experimental evidence to support our theoretical analysis. We propose two simple but effective methods inspired by the fixpoint computation in similarity flooding, and demonstrate their effectiveness on benchmark datasets. Our work bridges the gap between recent embedding-based models and the conventional similarity flooding algorithm. It would improve our understanding of and increase our faith in embedding-based EA.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sun23d	Zequn Sun, Jiacheng Huang, Xiaozhou Xu, Qijin Chen, Weijun Ren, Wei Hu
Revisiting Sampling for Combinatorial Optimization	Sampling approaches like Markov chain Monte Carlo were once popular for combinatorial optimization, but the inefficiency of classical methods and the need for problem-specific designs curtailed ongoing development. Recent work has favored data-driven approaches that mitigate the need for hand-craft heuristics, but these are often not usable as out-of-the-box solvers due to dependence on in-distribution training and limited scalability to large instances. In this paper, we revisit the idea of using sampling for combinatorial optimization, motivated by the significant recent advances of gradient-based discrete MCMC and new techniques for parallel neighborhood exploration on accelerators. Remarkably, we find that modern sampling strategies can leverage landscape information to provide general-purpose solvers that require no training and yet are competitive with state of the art combinatorial solvers. In particular, experiments on cover vertex selection, graph partition and routing demonstrate better speed-quality trade-offs over current learning based approaches, and sometimes even superior performance to commercial solvers and specialized algorithms.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sun23c	Haoran Sun, Katayoon Goshvadi, Azade Nova, Dale Schuurmans, Hanjun Dai
MetaModulation: Learning Variational Feature Hierarchies for Few-Shot Learning with Fewer Tasks	Meta-learning algorithms are able to learn a new task using previously learned knowledge, but they often require a large number of meta-training tasks which may not be readily available. To address this issue, we propose a method for few-shot learning with fewer tasks, which we call MetaModulation. The key idea is to use a neural network to increase the density of the meta-training tasks by modulating batch normalization parameters during meta-training. Additionally, we modify parameters at various neural network levels, rather than just a single layer, to increase task diversity. To account for the uncertainty caused by the reduced number of training tasks, we propose a variational MetaModulation where the modulation parameters are treated as latent variables. We also introduce learning variational feature hierarchies by the variational MetaModulation, which modulates features at all layers and can take into account task uncertainty and generate more diverse tasks. The ablation studies illustrate the advantages of utilizing a learnable task modulation at different levels and demonstrate the benefit of incorporating probabilistic variants in few-task meta-learning. Our MetaModulation and its variational variants consistently outperform state-of-the-art alternatives on four few-task meta-learning benchmarks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sun23b	Wenfang Sun, Yingjun Du, Xiantong Zhen, Fan Wang, Ling Wang, Cees G.

Vector-Valued Control Variates	Control variates are variance reduction tools for Monte Carlo estimators. They can provide significant variance reduction, but usually require a large number of samples, which can be prohibitive when sampling or evaluating the integrand is computationally expensive. Furthermore, there are many scenarios where we need to compute multiple related integrals simultaneously or sequentially, which can further exacerbate computational costs. In this paper, we propose vector-valued control variates, an extension of control variates which can be used to reduce the variance of multiple Monte Carlo estimators jointly. This allows for the transfer of information across integration tasks, and hence reduces the need for a large number of samples. We focus on control variates based on kernel interpolants and our novel construction is obtained through a generalised Stein identity and the development of novel matrix-valued Stein reproducing kernels. We demonstrate our methodology on a range of problems including multifidelity modelling, Bayesian inference for dynamical systems, and model evidence computation through thermodynamic integration.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sun23a	Zhuo Sun, Alessandro Barp, Francois-Xavier Briol
Distilling Internet-Scale Vision-Language Models into Embodied Agents	Instruction-following agents must ground language into their observation and action spaces. Learning to ground language is challenging, typically requiring domain-specific engineering or large quantities of human interaction data. To address this challenge, we propose using pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to supervise embodied agents. We combine ideas from model distillation and hindsight experience replay (HER), using a VLM to retroactively generate language describing the agent's behavior. Simple prompting allows us to control the supervision signal, teaching an agent to interact with novel objects based on their names (e.g., planes) or their features (e.g., colors) in a 3D rendered environment. Fewshot prompting lets us teach abstract category membership, including pre-existing categories (food vs toys) and ad-hoc ones (arbitrary preferences over objects). Our work outlines a new and effective way to use internet-scale VLMs, repurposing the generic language grounding acquired by such models to teach task-relevant groundings to embodied agents.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sumers23a	Theodore Sumers, Kenneth Marino, Arun Ahuja, Rob Fergus, Ishita Dasgupta
Adversarial Learning of Distributional Reinforcement Learning	Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant advancements in artificial intelligence. However, its real-world applications are limited due to differences between simulated environments and the actual world. Consequently, it is crucial to systematically analyze how each component of the RL system can affect the final model performance. In this study, we propose an adversarial learning framework for distributional reinforcement learning, which adopts the concept of influence measure from the statistics community. This framework enables us to detect performance loss caused by either the internal policy structure or the external state observation. The proposed influence measure is based on information geometry and has desirable properties of invariance. We demonstrate that the influence measure is useful for three diagnostic tasks: identifying fragile states in trajectories, determining the instability of the policy architecture, and pinpointing anomalously sensitive policy parameters.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sui23a	Yang Sui, Yukun Huang, Hongtu Zhu, Fan Zhou
Long-Tailed Recognition by Mutual Information Maximization between Latent Features and Ground-Truth Labels	Although contrastive learning methods have shown prevailing performance on a variety of representation learning tasks, they encounter difficulty when the training dataset is long-tailed. Many researchers have combined contrastive learning and a logit adjustment technique to address this problem, but the combinations are done ad-hoc and a theoretical background has not yet been provided. The goal of this paper is to provide the background and further improve the performance. First, we show that the fundamental reason contrastive learning methods struggle with long-tailed tasks is that they try to maximize the mutual information between latent features and input data. As ground-truth labels are not considered in the maximization, they are not able to address imbalances between classes. Rather, we interpret the long-tailed recognition task as a mutual information maximization between latent features and ground-truth labels. This approach integrates contrastive learning and logit adjustment seamlessly to derive a loss function that shows state-of-the-art performance on long-tailed recognition benchmarks. It also demonstrates its efficacy in image segmentation tasks, verifying its versatility beyond image classification. Code is available at https://github.com/bluecdm/Long-tailed-recognition.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/suh23a	Min-Kook Suh, Seung-Woo Seo
DUET: 2D Structured and Approximately Equivariant Representations	Multiview Self-Supervised Learning (MSSL) is based on learning invariances with respect to a set of input transformations. However, invariance partially or totally removes transformation-related information from the representations, which might harm performance for specific downstream tasks that require such information. We propose 2D strUctured and EquivarianT representations (coined DUET), which are 2d representations organized in a matrix structure, and equivariant with respect to transformations acting on the input data. DUET representations maintain information about an input transformation, while remaining semantically expressive. Compared to SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020) (unstructured and invariant) and ESSL (Dangovski et al., 2022) (unstructured and equivariant), the structured and equivariant nature of DUET representations enables controlled generation with lower reconstruction error, while controllability is not possible with SimCLR or ESSL. DUET also achieves higher accuracy for several discriminative tasks, and improves transfer learning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/suau23a	Xavier Suau, Federico Danieli, T.

Towards Robust Graph Incremental Learning on Evolving Graphs	Incremental learning is a machine learning approach that involves training a model on a sequence of tasks, rather than all tasks at once. This ability to learn incrementally from a stream of tasks is crucial for many real-world applications. However, incremental learning is a challenging problem on graph-structured data, as many graph-related problems involve prediction tasks for each individual node, known as Node-wise Graph Incremental Learning (NGIL). This introduces non-independent and non-identically distributed characteristics in the sample data generation process, making it difficult to maintain the performance of the model as new tasks are added. In this paper, we focus on the inductive NGIL problem, which accounts for the evolution of graph structure (structural shift) induced by emerging tasks. We provide a formal formulation and analysis of the problem, and propose a novel regularization-based technique called Structural-Shift-Risk-Mitigation (SSRM) to mitigate the impact of the structural shift on catastrophic forgetting of the inductive NGIL problem. We show that the structural shift can lead to a shift in the input distribution for the existing tasks, and further lead to an increased risk of catastrophic forgetting. Through comprehensive empirical studies with several benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed method, Structural-Shift-Risk-Mitigation (SSRM), is flexible and easy to adapt to improve the performance of state-of-the-art GNN incremental learning frameworks in the inductive setting.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/su23a	Junwei Su, Difan Zou, Zijun Zhang, Chuan Wu
Topologically Faithful Image Segmentation via Induced Matching of Persistence Barcodes	Segmentation models predominantly optimize pixel-overlap-based loss, an objective that is actually inadequate for many segmentation tasks. In recent years, their limitations fueled a growing interest in topology-aware methods, which aim to recover the topology of the segmented structures. However, so far, existing methods only consider global topological properties, ignoring the need to preserve topological features spatially, which is crucial for accurate segmentation. We introduce the concept of induced matchings from persistent homology to achieve a spatially correct matching between persistence barcodes in a segmentation setting. Based on this concept, we define the Betti matching error as an interpretable, topologically and feature-wise accurate metric for image segmentations, which resolves the limitations of the Betti number error. Our Betti matching error is differentiable and efficient to use as a loss function. We demonstrate that it improves the topological performance of segmentation networks significantly across six diverse datasets while preserving the performance with respect to traditional scores. Our code is publicly available (https://github.com/nstucki/Betti-matching/).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/stucki23a	Nico Stucki, Johannes C.

Kernel QuantTree	We present Kernel QuantTree (KQT), a non-parametric change detection algorithm that monitors multivariate data through a histogram.

We prove two key theoretical advantages of KQT:	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/stucchi23a	Diego Stucchi, Paolo Rizzo, Nicolò Folloni, Giacomo Boracchi
Lookahead When It Matters: Adaptive Non-causal Transformers for Streaming Neural Transducers	Streaming speech recognition architectures are employed for low-latency, real-time applications. Such architectures are often characterized by their causality. Causal architectures emit tokens at each frame, relying only on current and past signal, while non-causal models are exposed to a window of future frames at each step to increase predictive accuracy. This dichotomy amounts to a trade-off for real-time Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system design: profit from the low-latency benefit of strictly-causal architectures while accepting predictive performance limitations, or realize the modeling benefits of future-context models accompanied by their higher latency penalty. In this work, we relax the constraints of this choice and present the Adaptive Non-Causal Attention Transducer (ANCAT). Our architecture is non-causal in the traditional sense, but executes in a low-latency, streaming manner by dynamically choosing when to rely on future context and to what degree within the audio stream. The resulting mechanism, when coupled with our novel regularization algorithms, delivers comparable accuracy to non-causal configurations while improving significantly upon latency, closing the gap with their causal counterparts. We showcase our design experimentally by reporting comparative ASR task results with measures of accuracy and latency on both publicly accessible and production-scale, voice-assistant datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/strimel23a	Grant Strimel, Yi Xie, Brian John King, Martin Radfar, Ariya Rastrow, Athanasios Mouchtaris
Improving Expert Predictions with Conformal Prediction	Automated decision support systems promise to help human experts solve multiclass classification tasks more efficiently and accurately. However, existing systems typically require experts to understand when to cede agency to the system or when to exercise their own agency. Otherwise, the experts may be better off solving the classification tasks on their own. In this work, we develop an automated decision support system that, by design, does not require experts to understand when to trust the system to improve performance. Rather than providing (single) label predictions and letting experts decide when to trust these predictions, our system provides sets of label predictions constructed using conformal prediction—prediction sets—and forcefully asks experts to predict labels from these sets. By using conformal prediction, our system can precisely trade-off the probability that the true label is not in the prediction set, which determines how frequently our system will mislead the experts, and the size of the prediction set, which determines the difficulty of the classification task the experts need to solve using our system. In addition, we develop an efficient and near-optimal search method to find the conformal predictor under which the experts benefit the most from using our system. Simulation experiments using synthetic and real expert predictions demonstrate that our system may help experts make more accurate predictions and is robust to the accuracy of the classifier the conformal predictor relies on.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/straitouri23a	Eleni Straitouri, Lequn Wang, Nastaran Okati, Manuel Gomez Rodriguez
MODeL: Memory Optimizations for Deep Learning	The size of deep neural networks has grown exponentially in recent years. Unfortunately, hardware devices have not kept pace with the rapidly increasing memory requirements. To cope with this, researchers have proposed various techniques including spilling, rematerialization, reduced precision training, model pruning, and so on. However, these approaches suffer from various limitations, such as increasing training time, affecting model accuracy, or requiring extensive manual modifications to the neural networks. We present MODeL, an algorithm that optimizes the lifetime and memory location of the tensors used to train neural networks. Our method automatically reduces the memory usage of existing neural networks without any of the drawbacks of other techniques. We formulate the problem as a joint integer linear program (ILP). We present several techniques to simplify the encoding of the problem, and enable our approach to scale to the size of state-of-the-art neural networks using an off-the-shelf ILP solver. We experimentally demonstrate that MODeL only takes seconds to allow the training of neural networks using 30% less memory on average.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/steiner23a	Benoit Steiner, Mostafa Elhoushi, Jacob Kahn, James Hegarty
Partial Optimality in Cubic Correlation Clustering	The higher-order correlation clustering problem is an expressive model, and recently, local search heuristics have been proposed for several applications. Certifying optimality, however, is NP-hard and practically hampered already by the complexity of the problem statement. Here, we focus on establishing partial optimality conditions for the special case of complete graphs and cubic objective functions. In addition, we define and implement algorithms for testing these conditions and examine their effect numerically, on two datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/stein23a	David Stein, Silvia Di Gregorio, Bjoern Andres
FaDIn: Fast Discretized Inference for Hawkes Processes with General Parametric Kernels	Temporal point processes (TPP) are a natural tool for modeling event-based data. Among all TPP models, Hawkes processes have proven to be the most widely used, mainly due to their adequate modeling for various applications, particularly when considering exponential or non-parametric kernels. Although non-parametric kernels are an option, such models require large datasets. While exponential kernels are more data efficient and relevant for specific applications where events immediately trigger more events, they are ill-suited for applications where latencies need to be estimated, such as in neuroscience. This work aims to offer an efficient solution to TPP inference using general parametric kernels with finite support. The developed solution consists of a fast $\ell_2$ gradient-based solver leveraging a discretized version of the events. After theoretically supporting the use of discretization, the statistical and computational efficiency of the novel approach is demonstrated through various numerical experiments. Finally, the method's effectiveness is evaluated by modeling the occurrence of stimuli-induced patterns from brain signals recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Given the use of general parametric kernels, results show that the proposed approach leads to an improved estimation of pattern latency than the state-of-the-art.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/staerman23a	Guillaume Staerman, Cédric Allain, Alexandre Gramfort, Thomas Moreau
Generating Language Corrections for Teaching Physical Control Tasks	AI assistance continues to help advance applications in education, from language learning to intelligent tutoring systems, yet current methods for providing students feedback are still quite limited. Most automatic feedback systems either provide binary correctness feedback, which may not help a student understand how to improve, or require hand-coding feedback templates, which may not generalize to new domains. This can be particularly challenging for physical control tasks, where the rich diversity in student behavior and specialized domains make it challenging to leverage general-purpose assistive tools for providing feedback. We design and build CORGI, a model trained to generate language corrections for physical control tasks, such as learning to ride a bike. CORGI takes in as input a pair of student and expert trajectories, and then generates natural language corrections to help the student improve. We collect and train CORGI over data from three diverse physical control tasks (drawing, steering, and joint movement). Through both automatic and human evaluations, we show that CORGI can (i) generate valid feedback for novel student trajectories, (ii) outperform baselines on domains with novel control dynamics, and (iii) improve student learning in an interactive drawing task.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/srivastava23a	Megha Srivastava, Noah Goodman, Dorsa Sadigh
Linear Causal Disentanglement via Interventions	Causal disentanglement seeks a representation of data involving latent variables that are related via a causal model. A representation is identifiable if both the latent model and the transformation from latent to observed variables are unique. In this paper, we study observed variables that are a linear transformation of a linear latent causal model. Data from interventions are necessary for identifiability: if one latent variable is missing an intervention, we show that there exist distinct models that cannot be distinguished. Conversely, we show that a single intervention on each latent variable is sufficient for identifiability. Our proof uses a generalization of the RQ decomposition of a matrix that replaces the usual orthogonal and upper triangular conditions with analogues depending on a partial order on the rows of the matrix, with partial order determined by a latent causal model. We corroborate our theoretical results with a method for causal disentanglement. We show that the method accurately recovers a latent causal model on synthetic and semi-synthetic data and we illustrate a use case on a dataset of single-cell RNA sequencing measurements.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/squires23a	Chandler Squires, Anna Seigal, Salil S Bhate, Caroline Uhler
Are labels informative in semi-supervised learning? Estimating and leveraging the missing-data mechanism.	"Semi-supervised learning is a powerful technique for leveraging unlabeled data to improve machine learning models, but it can be affected by the presence of ""informative"" labels, which occur when some classes are more likely to be labeled than others. In the missing data literature, such labels are called missing not at random. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address this issue by estimating the missing-data mechanism and using inverse propensity weighting to debias any SSL algorithm, including those using data augmentation. We also propose a likelihood ratio test to assess whether or not labels are indeed informative. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods on different datasets, in particular on two medical datasets for which we design pseudo-realistic missing data scenarios."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sportisse23a	Aude Sportisse, Hugo Schmutz, Olivier Humbert, Charles Bouveyron, Pierre-Alexandre Mattei
Differentiable Tree Operations Promote Compositional Generalization	In the context of structure-to-structure transformation tasks, learning sequences of discrete symbolic operations poses significant challenges due to their non-differentiability. To facilitate the learning of these symbolic sequences, we introduce a differentiable tree interpreter that compiles high-level symbolic tree operations into subsymbolic matrix operations on tensors. We present a novel Differentiable Tree Machine (DTM) architecture that integrates our interpreter with an external memory and an agent that learns to sequentially select tree operations to execute the target transformation in an end-to-end manner. With respect to out-of-distribution compositional generalization on synthetic semantic parsing and language generation tasks, DTM achieves 100% while existing baselines such as Transformer, Tree Transformer, LSTM, and Tree2Tree LSTM achieve less than 30%. DTM remains highly interpretable in addition to its perfect performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/soulos23a	Paul Soulos, Edward J Hu, Kate Mccurdy, Yunmo Chen, Roland Fernandez, Paul Smolensky, Jianfeng Gao
Loss-Guided Diffusion Models for Plug-and-Play Controllable Generation	We consider guiding denoising diffusion models with general differentiable loss functions in a plug-and-play fashion, enabling controllable generation without additional training. This paradigm, termed Loss-Guided Diffusion (LGD), can easily be integrated into all diffusion models and leverage various efficient samplers. Despite the benefits, the resulting guidance term is, unfortunately, an intractable integral and needs to be approximated. Existing methods compute the guidance term based on a point estimate. However, we show that such approaches have significant errors over the scale of the approximations. To address this issue, we propose a Monte Carlo method that uses multiple samples from a suitable distribution to reduce bias. Our method is effective in various synthetic and real-world settings, including image super-resolution, text or label-conditional image generation, and controllable motion synthesis. Notably, we show how our method can be applied to control a pretrained motion diffusion model to follow certain paths and avoid obstacles that are proven challenging to prior methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/song23k	Jiaming Song, Qinsheng Zhang, Hongxu Yin, Morteza Mardani, Ming-Yu Liu, Jan Kautz, Yongxin Chen, Arash Vahdat
A Nearly-Optimal Bound for Fast Regression with $\ell_∞$ Guarantee	"Given a matrix $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ and a vector $b\in \mathbb{R}^n$, we consider the regression problem with $\ell_\infty$ guarantees: finding a vector $x'\in \mathbb{R}^d$ such that $||x'-x^* ||_\infty \leq \frac{\epsilon}{\sqrt{d}}\cdot ||Ax^*-b||_2\cdot ||A^\dagger||$ with $x^*$ being the optimal solution to the regression $||Ax-b||_2$. One popular approach for solving $\ell_2$ regression problem is via sketching: picking a structured random matrix $S\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ with $m\ll n$ and $SA$ can be quickly computed, solve the ""sketched"" regression problem $x'=\mathrm{argmin} ||SAx-Sb||_2$.

Sketching Meets Differential Privacy: Fast Algorithm for Dynamic Kronecker Projection Maintenance	Projection maintenance is one of the core data structure tasks. Efficient data structures for projection maintenance have led to recent breakthroughs in many convex programming algorithms. In this work, we further extend this framework to the Kronecker product structure. Given a constraint matrix ${\sf A}$ and a positive semi-definite matrix $W\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ with a sparse eigenbasis, we consider the task of maintaining the projection in the form of ${\sf B}^\top({\sf B}{\sf B}^\top)^{-1}{\sf B}$, where ${\sf B}={\sf A}(W\otimes I)$ or ${\sf B}={\sf A}(W^{1/2}\otimes W^{1/2})$. At each iteration, the weight matrix $W$ receives a low rank change and we receive a new vector $h$. The goal is to maintain the projection matrix and answer the query ${\sf B}^\top({\sf B}{\sf B}^\top)^{-1}{\sf B}h$ with good approximation guarantees. We design a fast dynamic data structure for this task and it is robust against an adaptive adversary. Following the beautiful and pioneering work of [Beimel, Kaplan, Mansour, Nissim, Saranurak and Stemmer, STOC'22], we use tools from differential privacy to reduce the randomness required by the data structure and further improve the running time.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/song23i	Zhao Song, Xin Yang, Yuanyuan Yang, Lichen Zhang
Sketching for First Order Method: Efficient Algorithm for Low-Bandwidth Channel and Vulnerability	"Sketching is one of the most fundamental tools in large-scale machine learning. It enables runtime and memory saving via randomly compressing the original large problem into lower dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel sketching scheme for the first order method in large-scale distributed learning setting, such that the communication costs between distributed agents are saved while the convergence of the algorithms is still guaranteed. Given gradient information in a high dimension $d$, the agent passes the compressed information processed by a sketching matrix $R\in \mathbb{R}^{s\times d}$ with $s\ll d$, and the receiver de-compressed via the de-sketching matrix $R^\top$ to ""recover"" the information in original dimension. Using such a framework, we develop algorithms for federated learning with lower communication costs. However, such random sketching does not protect the privacy of local data directly. We show that the gradient leakage problem still exists after applying the sketching technique by presenting a specific gradient attack method. As a remedy, we prove rigorously that the algorithm will be differentially private by adding additional random noises in gradient information, which results in a both communication-efficient and differentially private first order approach for federated learning tasks. Our sketching scheme can be further generalized to other learning settings and might be of independent interest itself."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/song23h	Zhao Song, Yitan Wang, Zheng Yu, Lichen Zhang
Importance Weighted Expectation-Maximization for Protein Sequence Design	Designing protein sequences with desired biological function is crucial in biology and chemistry. Recent machine learning methods use a surrogate sequence-function model to replace the expensive wet-lab validation. How can we efficiently generate diverse and novel protein sequences with high fitness? In this paper, we propose IsEM-Pro, an approach to generate protein sequences towards a given fitness criterion. At its core, IsEM-Pro is a latent generative model, augmented by combinatorial structure features from a separately learned Markov random fields (MRFs). We develop an Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization method (MCEM) to learn the model. During inference, sampling from its latent space enhances diversity while its MRFs features guide the exploration in high fitness regions. Experiments on eight protein sequence design tasks show that our IsEM-Pro outperforms the previous best methods by at least 55% on average fitness score and generates more diverse and novel protein sequences.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/song23g	Zhenqiao Song, Lei Li
RGE: A Repulsive Graph Rectification for Node Classification via Influence	In real-world graphs, noisy connections are inevitable, which makes it difficult to obtain unbiased node representations. Among various attempts to resolve this problem, a method of estimating the counterfactual effects of these connectivities has recently attracted attention, which mainly uses influence functions for single graph elements (i.e., node and edge). However, in this paper, we argue that there is a strongly interacting group effect between the influences of graph elements due to their connectivity. In the same vein, we observe that edge groups connecting to the same train node exhibit significant differences in their influences, hence no matter how negative each is, removing them at once may have a rather negative effect as a group. Based on this motivation, we propose a new edge-removing strategy, Repulsive edge Group Elimination (RGE), that preferentially removes edges with no interference in groups. Empirically, we demonstrate that RGE consistently outperforms existing methods on the various benchmark datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/song23f	Jaeyun Song, Sungyub Kim, Eunho Yang
FedAvg Converges to Zero Training Loss Linearly for Overparameterized Multi-Layer Neural Networks	Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows multiple clients to learn a joint model by utilizing privately held data at each client. Significant research efforts have been devoted to develop advanced algorithms that deal with the situation where the data at individual clients have heterogeneous distributions. In this work, we show that data heterogeneity can be dealt from a different perspective. That is, by utilizing a certain overparameterized multi-layer neural network at each client, even the vanilla FedAvg (a.k.a. the Local SGD) algorithm can accurately optimize the training problem: When each client has a neural network with one wide layer of size $N$ (where $N$ is the number of total training samples), followed by layers of smaller widths, FedAvg converges linearly to a solution that achieves (almost) zero training loss, without requiring any assumptions on the clients' data distributions. To our knowledge, this is the first work that demonstrates such resilience to data heterogeneity for FedAvg when trained on multi-layer neural networks. Our experiments also confirm that, neural networks of large size can achieve better and more stable performance for FL problems.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/song23e	Bingqing Song, Prashant Khanduri, Xinwei Zhang, Jinfeng Yi, Mingyi Hong
Latent Traversals in Generative Models as Potential Flows	Despite the significant recent progress in deep generative models, the underlying structure of their latent spaces is still poorly understood, thereby making the task of performing semantically meaningful latent traversals an open research challenge. Most prior work has aimed to solve this challenge by modeling latent structures linearly, and finding corresponding linear directions which result in 'disentangled' generations. In this work, we instead propose to model latent structures with a learned dynamic potential landscape, thereby performing latent traversals as the flow of samples down the landscape's gradient. Inspired by physics, optimal transport, and neuroscience, these potential landscapes are learned as physically realistic partial differential equations, thereby allowing them to flexibly vary over both space and time. To achieve disentanglement, multiple potentials are learned simultaneously, and are constrained by a classifier to be distinct and semantically self-consistent. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our method achieves both more qualitatively and quantitatively disentangled trajectories than state-of-the-art baselines. Further, we demonstrate that our method can be integrated as a regularization term during training, thereby acting as an inductive bias towards the learning of structured representations, ultimately improving model likelihood on similarly structured data.

Deep Perturbation Learning: Enhancing the Network Performance via Image Perturbations	Image perturbation technique is widely used to generate adversarial examples to attack networks, greatly decreasing the performance of networks. Unlike the existing works, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework Deep Perturbation Learning (DPL), the new insights into understanding image perturbations, to enhance the performance of networks rather than decrease the performance. Specifically, we learn image perturbations to amend the data distribution of training set to improve the performance of networks. This optimization w.r.t data distribution is non-trivial. To approach this, we tactfully construct a differentiable optimization target w.r.t. image perturbations via minimizing the empirical risk. Then we propose an alternating optimization of the network weights and perturbations. DPL can easily be adapted to a wide spectrum of downstream tasks and backbone networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPL on 6 datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR100, ImageNet, MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, and SBD) over 3 popular vision tasks (image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation) with different backbone architectures (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet, and ViT).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/song23c	Zifan Song, Xiao Gong, Guosheng Hu, Cairong Zhao
LipsNet: A Smooth and Robust Neural Network with Adaptive Lipschitz Constant for High Accuracy Optimal Control	Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach for solving optimal control problems. However, RL-trained policies often suffer from the action fluctuation problem, where the consecutive actions significantly differ despite only slight state variations. This problem results in mechanical components' wear and tear and poses safety hazards. The action fluctuation is caused by the high Lipschitz constant of actor networks. To address this problem, we propose a neural network named LipsNet. We propose the Multi-dimensional Gradient Normalization (MGN) method, to constrain the Lipschitz constant of networks with multi-dimensional input and output. Benefiting from MGN, LipsNet achieves Lipschitz continuity, allowing smooth actions while preserving control performance by adjusting Lipschitz constant. LipsNet addresses the action fluctuation problem at network level rather than algorithm level, which can serve as actor networks in most RL algorithms, making it more flexible and user-friendly than previous works. Experiments demonstrate that LipsNet has good landscape smoothness and noise robustness, resulting in significantly smoother action compared to the Multilayer Perceptron.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/song23b	Xujie Song, Jingliang Duan, Wenxuan Wang, Shengbo Eben Li, Chen Chen, Bo Cheng, Bo Zhang, Junqing Wei, Xiaoming Simon Wang
Consistency Models	Diffusion models have significantly advanced the fields of image, audio, and video generation, but they depend on an iterative sampling process that causes slow generation. To overcome this limitation, we propose consistency models, a new family of models that generate high quality samples by directly mapping noise to data. They support fast one-step generation by design, while still allowing multistep sampling to trade compute for sample quality. They also support zero-shot data editing, such as image inpainting, colorization, and super-resolution, without requiring explicit training on these tasks. Consistency models can be trained either by distilling pre-trained diffusion models, or as standalone generative models altogether. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that they outperform existing distillation techniques for diffusion models in one- and few-step sampling, achieving the new state-of-the-art FID of 3.55 on CIFAR-10 and 6.20 on ImageNet 64x64 for one-step generation. When trained in isolation, consistency models become a new family of generative models that can outperform existing one-step, non-adversarial generative models on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10, ImageNet 64x64 and LSUN 256x256.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/song23a	Yang Song, Prafulla Dhariwal, Mark Chen, Ilya Sutskever
Meta-SAGE: Scale Meta-Learning Scheduled Adaptation with Guided Exploration for Mitigating Scale Shift on Combinatorial Optimization	This paper proposes Meta-SAGE, a novel approach for improving the scalability of deep reinforcement learning models for combinatorial optimization (CO) tasks. Our method adapts pre-trained models to larger-scale problems in test time by suggesting two components: a scale meta-learner (SML) and scheduled adaptation with guided exploration (SAGE). First, SML transforms the context embedding for subsequent adaptation of SAGE based on scale information. Then, SAGE adjusts the model parameters dedicated to the context embedding for a specific instance. SAGE introduces locality bias, which encourages selecting nearby locations to determine the next location. The locality bias gradually decays as the model is adapted to the target instance. Results show that Meta-SAGE outperforms previous adaptation methods and significantly improves scalability in representative CO tasks.

Abstracting Imperfect Information Away from Two-Player Zero-Sum Games	In their seminal work, Nayyar et al. (2013) showed that imperfect information can be abstracted away from common-payoff games by having players publicly announce their policies as they play. This insight underpins sound solvers and decision-time planning algorithms for common-payoff games. Unfortunately, a naive application of the same insight to two-player zero-sum games fails because Nash equilibria of the game with public policy announcements may not correspond to Nash equilibria of the original game. As a consequence, existing sound decision-time planning algorithms require complicated additional mechanisms that have unappealing properties. The main contribution of this work is showing that certain regularized equilibria do not possess the aforementioned non-correspondence problem—thus, computing them can be treated as perfect-information problems. Because these regularized equilibria can be made arbitrarily close to Nash equilibria, our result opens the door to a new perspective to solving two-player zero-sum games and yields a simplified framework for decision-time planning in two-player zero-sum games, void of the unappealing properties that plague existing decision-time planning approaches.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sokota23a	Samuel Sokota, Ryan D’Orazio, Chun Kai Ling, David J Wu, J Zico Kolter, Noam Brown
The Dormant Neuron Phenomenon in Deep Reinforcement Learning	In this work we identify the dormant neuron phenomenon in deep reinforcement learning, where an agent's network suffers from an increasing number of inactive neurons, thereby affecting network expressivity. We demonstrate the presence of this phenomenon across a variety of algorithms and environments, and highlight its effect on learning. To address this issue, we propose a simple and effective method (ReDo) that Recycles Dormant neurons throughout training. Our experiments demonstrate that ReDo maintains the expressive power of networks by reducing the number of dormant neurons and results in improved performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sokar23a	Ghada Sokar, Rishabh Agarwal, Pablo Samuel Castro, Utku Evci
Fair Densities via Boosting the Sufficient Statistics of Exponential Families	We introduce a boosting algorithm to pre-process data for fairness. Starting from an initial fair but inaccurate distribution, our approach shifts towards better data fitting while still ensuring a minimal fairness guarantee. To do so, it learns the sufficient statistics of an exponential family with boosting-compliant convergence. Importantly, we are able to theoretically prove that the learned distribution will have a representation rate and statistical rate data fairness guarantee. Unlike recent optimization based pre-processing methods, our approach can be easily adapted for continuous domain features. Furthermore, when the weak learners are specified to be decision trees, the sufficient statistics of the learned distribution can be examined to provide clues on sources of (un)fairness. Empirical results are present to display the quality of result on real-world data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/soen23a	Alexander Soen, Hisham Husain, Richard Nock
On the Effectiveness of Offline RL for Dialogue Response Generation	A common training technique for language models is teacher forcing (TF). TF attempts to match human language exactly, even though identical meanings can be expressed in different ways. This motivates use of sequence-level objectives for dialogue response generation. In this paper, we study the efficacy of various offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods to maximize such objectives. We present a comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets, models, and metrics. Offline RL shows a clear performance improvement over teacher forcing while not inducing training instability or sacrificing practical training budgets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sodhi23a	Paloma Sodhi, Felix Wu, Ethan R.

A Game-Theoretic Framework for Managing Risk in Multi-Agent Systems	In order for agents in multi-agent systems (MAS) to be safe, they need to take into account the risks posed by the actions of other agents. However, the dominant paradigm in game theory (GT) assumes that agents are not affected by risk from other agents and only strive to maximise their expected utility. For example, in hybrid human-AI driving systems, it is necessary to limit large deviations in reward resulting from car crashes. Although there are equilibrium concepts in game theory that take into account risk aversion, they either assume that agents are risk-neutral with respect to the uncertainty caused by the actions of other agents, or they are not guaranteed to exist. We introduce a new GT-based Risk-Averse Equilibrium (RAE) that always produces a solution that minimises the potential variance in reward accounting for the strategy of other agents. Theoretically and empirically, we show RAE shares many properties with a Nash Equilibrium (NE), establishing convergence properties and generalising to risk-dominant NE in certain cases. To tackle large-scale problems, we extend RAE to the PSRO multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. We empirically demonstrate the minimum reward variance benefits of RAE in matrix games with high-risk outcomes. Results on MARL experiments show RAE generalises to risk-dominant NE in a trust dilemma game and that it reduces instances of crashing by 7x in an autonomous driving setting versus the best performing baseline.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/slumbers23a	Oliver Slumbers, David Henry Mguni, Stefano B Blumberg, Stephen Marcus Mcaleer, Yaodong Yang, Jun Wang
Invariance in Policy Optimisation and Partial Identifiability in Reward Learning	It is often very challenging to manually design reward functions for complex, real-world tasks. To solve this, one can instead use reward learning to infer a reward function from data. However, there are often multiple reward functions that fit the data equally well, even in the infinite-data limit. This means that the reward function is only partially identifiable. In this work, we formally characterise the partial identifiability of the reward function given several popular reward learning data sources, including expert demonstrations and trajectory comparisons. We also analyse the impact of this partial identifiability for several downstream tasks, such as policy optimisation. We unify our results in a framework for comparing data sources and downstream tasks by their invariances, with implications for the design and selection of data sources for reward learning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/skalse23a	Joar Max Viktor Skalse, Matthew Farrugia-Roberts, Stuart Russell, Alessandro Abate, Adam Gleave
Preprocessors Matter! Realistic Decision-Based Attacks on Machine Learning Systems	Decision-based attacks construct adversarial examples against a machine learning (ML) model by making only hard-label queries. These attacks have mainly been applied directly to standalone neural networks. However, in practice, ML models are just one component of a larger learning system. We find that by adding a single preprocessor in front of a classifier, state-of-the-art query-based attacks are up to seven× less effective at attacking a prediction pipeline than at attacking the model alone. We explain this discrepancy by the fact that most preprocessors introduce some notion of invariance to the input space. Hence, attacks that are unaware of this invariance inevitably waste a large number of queries to re-discover or overcome it. We, therefore, develop techniques to (i) reverse-engineer the preprocessor and then (ii) use this extracted information to attack the end-to-end system. Our preprocessors extraction method requires only a few hundred queries, and our preprocessor-aware attacks recover the same efficacy as when attacking the model alone. The code can be found at https://github.com/google-research/preprocessor-aware-black-box-attack.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sitawarin23a	Chawin Sitawarin, Florian Tramèr, Nicholas Carlini
Differentiable Simulations for Enhanced Sampling of Rare Events	Simulating rare events, such as the transformation of a reactant into a product in a chemical reaction typically requires enhanced sampling techniques that rely on heuristically chosen collective variables (CVs). We propose using differentiable simulations (DiffSim) for the discovery and enhanced sampling of chemical transformations without a need to resort to preselected CVs, using only a distance metric. Reaction path discovery and estimation of the biasing potential that enhances the sampling are merged into a single end-to-end problem that is solved by path-integral optimization. This is achieved by introducing multiple improvements over standard DiffSim such as partial backpropagation and graph mini-batching making DiffSim training stable and efficient. The potential of DiffSim is demonstrated in the successful discovery of transition paths for the Muller-Brown model potential as well as a benchmark chemical system - alanine dipeptide.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sipka23a	Martin Sipka, Johannes C.

When do Minimax-fair Learning and Empirical Risk Minimization Coincide?	Minimax-fair machine learning minimizes the error for the worst-off group. However, empirical evidence suggests that when sophisticated models are trained with standard empirical risk minimization (ERM), they often have the same performance on the worst-off group as a minimax-trained model. Our work makes this counter-intuitive observation concrete. We prove that if the hypothesis class is sufficiently expressive and the group information is recoverable from the features, ERM and minimax-fairness learning formulations indeed have the same performance on the worst-off group. We provide additional empirical evidence of how this observation holds on a wide range of datasets and hypothesis classes. Since ERM is fundamentally easier than minimax optimization, our findings have implications on the practice of fair machine learning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/singh23b	Harvineet Singh, Matthäus Kleindessner, Volkan Cevher, Rumi Chunara, Chris Russell
The Hessian perspective into the Nature of Convolutional Neural Networks	While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have long been investigated and applied, as well as theorized, we aim to provide a slightly different perspective into their nature — through the perspective of their Hessian maps. The reason is that the loss Hessian captures the pairwise interaction of parameters and therefore forms a natural ground to probe how the architectural aspects of CNNs get manifested in their structure and properties. We develop a framework relying on Toeplitz representation of CNNs, and then utilize it to reveal the Hessian structure and, in particular, its rank. We prove tight upper bounds (with linear activations), which closely follow the empirical trend of the Hessian rank and in practice also hold for more general settings. Overall, our work generalizes and further establishes the key insight that the Hessian rank grows as the square root of the number of parameters, even in CNNs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/singh23a	Sidak Pal Singh, Thomas Hofmann, Bernhard Schölkopf
Text-To-4D Dynamic Scene Generation	We present MAV3D (Make-A-Video3D), a method for generating three-dimensional dynamic scenes from text descriptions. Our approach uses a 4D dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which is optimized for scene appearance, density, and motion consistency by querying a Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion-based model. The dynamic video output generated from the provided text can be viewed from any camera location and angle, and can be composited into any 3D environment. MAV3D does not require any 3D or 4D data and the T2V model is trained only on Text-Image pairs and unlabeled videos. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments and show an improvement over previously established internal baselines. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to generate 3D dynamic scenes given a text description.

Hindsight Learning for MDPs with Exogenous Inputs	Many resource management problems require sequential decision-making under uncertainty, where the only uncertainty affecting the decision outcomes are exogenous variables outside the control of the decision-maker. We model these problems as Exo-MDPs (Markov Decision Processes with Exogenous Inputs) and design a class of data-efficient algorithms for them termed Hindsight Learning (HL). Our HL algorithms achieve data efficiency by leveraging a key insight: having samples of the exogenous variables, past decisions can be revisited in hindsight to infer counterfactual consequences that can accelerate policy improvements. We compare HL against classic baselines in the multi-secretary and airline revenue management problems. We also scale our algorithms to a business-critical cloud resource management problem – allocating Virtual Machines (VMs) to physical machines, and simulate their performance with real datasets from a large public cloud provider. We find that HL algorithms outperform domain-specific heuristics, as well as state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sinclair23a	Sean R.

On the Stepwise Nature of Self-Supervised Learning	We present a simple picture of the training process of self-supervised learning methods with dual deep networks. In our picture, these methods learn their high-dimensional embeddings one dimension at a time in a sequence of discrete, well-separated steps. We arrive at this picture via the study of a linear toy model of Barlow Twins, applicable to the case in which the trained network is infinitely wide. We solve the training dynamics of our toy model from small initialization, finding that the model learns the top eigenmodes of a certain contrastive kernel in a discrete, stepwise fashion, and find a closed-form expression for the final learned representations. Remarkably, we see the same stepwise learning phenomenon when training deep ResNets using the Barlow Twins, SimCLR, and VICReg losses. This stepwise picture partially demystifies the process of self-supervised training.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/simon23a	James B Simon, Maksis Knutins, Liu Ziyin, Daniel Geisz, Abraham J Fetterman, Joshua Albrecht
Statistical Learning under Heterogenous Distribution Shift	"This paper studies the prediction of a target $\mathbf{z}$ from a pair of random variables $(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where the ground-truth predictor is additive $\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{z} \mid \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}] = f_\star(\mathbf{x}) +g_{\star}(\mathbf{y})$. We study the performance of empirical risk minimization (ERM) over functions $f+g$, $f \in \mathcal{F}$ and $g \in \mathcal{G}$, fit on a given training distribution, but evaluated on a test distribution which exhibits covariate shift. We show that, when the class $\mathcal{F}$ is ""simpler"" than $\mathcal{G}$ (measured, e.g., in terms of its metric entropy), our predictor is more resilient to"	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/simchowitz23a	Max Simchowitz, Anurag Ajay, Pulkit Agrawal, Akshay Krishnamurthy
Pricing Experimental Design: Causal Effect, Expected Revenue and Tail Risk	When launching a new product, historical sales data is often not available, leaving price as a crucial experimental instrument for sellers to gauge market response. When designing pricing experiments, there are three fundamental objectives: estimating the causal effect of price (i.e., price elasticity), maximizing the expected revenue through the experiment, and controlling the tail risk suffering from a very huge loss. In this paper, we reveal the relationship among such three objectives. Under a linear structural model, we investigate the trade-offs between causal inference and expected revenue maximization, as well as between expected revenue maximization and tail risk control. Furthermore, we propose an optimal pricing experimental design, which can flexibly adapt to different desired levels of trade-offs. Through the optimal design, we also explore the relationship between causal inference and tail risk control.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/simchi-levi23a	David Simchi-Levi, Chonghuan Wang
Quantitative Universal Approximation Bounds for Deep Belief Networks	We show that deep belief networks with binary hidden units can approximate any multivariate probability density under very mild integrability requirements on the parental density of the visible nodes. The approximation is measured in the $L^q$-norm for $q\in[1,\infty]$ ($q=\infty$ corresponding to the supremum norm) and in Kullback-Leibler divergence. Furthermore, we establish sharp quantitative bounds on the approximation error in terms of the number of hidden units.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sieber23a	Julian Sieber, Johann Gehringer
Unearthing InSights into Mars: Unsupervised Source Separation with Limited Data	Source separation involves the ill-posed problem of retrieving a set of source signals that have been observed through a mixing operator. Solving this problem requires prior knowledge, which is commonly incorporated by imposing regularity conditions on the source signals, or implicitly learned through supervised or unsupervised methods from existing data. While data-driven methods have shown great promise in source separation, they often require large amounts of data, which rarely exists in planetary space missions. To address this challenge, we propose an unsupervised source separation scheme for domains with limited data access that involves solving an optimization problem in the wavelet scattering covariance representation space—an interpretable, low-dimensional representation of stationary processes. We present a real-data example in which we remove transient, thermally-induced microtilts—known as glitches—from data recorded by a seismometer during NASA's InSight mission on Mars. Thanks to the wavelet scattering covariances' ability to capture non-Gaussian properties of stochastic processes, we are able to separate glitches using only a few glitch-free data snippets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/siahkoohi23a	Ali Siahkoohi, Rudy Morel, Maarten V.

Semi-Autoregressive Energy Flows: Exploring Likelihood-Free Training of Normalizing Flows	Training normalizing flow generative models can be challenging due to the need to calculate computationally expensive determinants of Jacobians. This paper studies the likelihood-free training of flows and proposes the energy objective, an alternative sample-based loss based on proper scoring rules. The energy objective is determinant-free and supports flexible model architectures that are not easily compatible with maximum likelihood training, including semi-autoregressive energy flows, a novel model family that interpolates between fully autoregressive and non-autoregressive models. Energy flows feature competitive sample quality, posterior inference, and generation speed relative to likelihood-based flows; this performance is decorrelated from the quality of log-likelihood estimates, which are generally very poor. Our findings question the use of maximum likelihood as an objective or a metric, and contribute to a scientific study of its role in generative modeling.

CLIPood: Generalizing CLIP to Out-of-Distributions	Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, where the model needs to handle distribution shifts from training, is a major challenge of machine learning. Contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) models have shown impressive zero-shot ability, but the further adaptation of CLIP on downstream tasks undesirably degrades OOD performances. This paper aims at generalizing CLIP to out-of-distribution test data on downstream tasks. We propose CLIPood, a fine-tuning method that can adapt CLIP models to OOD situations where both domain shifts and open classes may occur on the unseen test data. To exploit the semantic relations between classes from the text modality, CLIPood introduces a new training objective, margin metric softmax (MMS), with class adaptive margins for fine-tuning. To incorporate both pre-trained zero-shot model and fine-tuned task-adaptive model, CLIPood leverages a new optimization strategy, Beta moving average (BMA), to maintain a temporal ensemble weighted by Beta distribution. Experiments on diverse datasets with different OOD scenarios show that CLIPood consistently outperforms existing generalization techniques.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shu23a	Yang Shu, Xingzhuo Guo, Jialong Wu, Ximei Wang, Jianmin Wang, Mingsheng Long
Repository-Level Prompt Generation for Large Language Models of Code	With the success of large language models (LLMs) of code and their use as code assistants (e.g. Codex used in GitHub Copilot), techniques for introducing domain-specific knowledge in the prompt design process become important. In this work, we propose a framework called Repo-Level Prompt Generator that learns to generate example-specific prompts using prompt proposals. The prompt proposals take context from the entire repository, thereby incorporating both the structure of the repository and the context from other relevant files (e.g. imports, parent class files). Our technique doesn't require any access to the weights of the LLM, making it applicable in cases where we only have black-box access to the LLM. We conduct experiments on the task of single-line code auto-completion using code repositories taken from Google Code archives. We demonstrate that an oracle constructed from our prompt proposals gives a relative improvement of 36% over Codex, showing the quality of these proposals. Further, we show that when we train a model to predict a prompt proposal, we can achieve significant performance gains over Codex and other baselines. We release our code, data, and trained checkpoints at: https://github.com/shrivastavadisha/repo_level_prompt_generation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shrivastava23a	Disha Shrivastava, Hugo Larochelle, Daniel Tarlow
Causal Bounds in Quasi-Markovian Graphs	We consider the problem of computing bounds for causal queries on quasi-Markovian graphs with unobserved confounders and discrete valued observed variables, where identifiability does not hold. Existing non-parametric approaches for computing such bounds use multilinear programming (MP) formulations that are often intractable for existing solvers when the degree of the polynomial objective is greater than two. Hence, one often has to resort to either fast approximate heuristics which are not guaranteed to contain the true query value, or more accurate but computationally intensive procedures. We show how to construct an equivalent MP with a polynomial objective of lower degree. In particular, the degree of the objective in the new MP is equal to only the number of C-components that are intervened upon, instead of the total number of C-components. As a result, we can compute exact bounds for significantly larger causal inference problems as compared to what is possible using existing techniques. We also propose a very efficient Frank-Wolfe heuristic that produces very high quality bounds, and scales to large multilinear problems of higher degree.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shridharan23a	Madhumitha Shridharan, Garud Iyengar
Probabilistic Attention-to-Influence Neural Models for Event Sequences	Discovering knowledge about which types of events influence others, using datasets of event sequences without time stamps, has several practical applications. While neural sequence models are able to capture complex and potentially long-range historical dependencies, they often lack the interpretability of simpler models for event sequence dynamics. We provide a novel neural framework in such a setting - a probabilistic attention-to-influence neural model - which not only captures complex instance-wise interactions between events but also learns influencers for each event type of interest. Given event sequence data and a prior distribution on type-wise influence, we efficiently learn an approximate posterior for type-wise influence by an attention-to-influence transformation using variational inference. Our method subsequently models the conditional likelihood of sequences by sampling the above posterior to focus attention on influencing event types. We motivate our general framework and show improved performance in experiments compared to existing baselines on synthetic data as well as real-world benchmarks, for tasks involving prediction and influencing set identification.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shou23a	Xiao Shou, Debarun Bhattacharjya, Tian Gao, Dharmashankar Subramanian, Oktie Hassanzadeh, Kristin Bennett
Synthetic data for model selection	Recent breakthroughs in synthetic data generation approaches made it possible to produce highly photorealistic images which are hardly distinguishable from real ones. Furthermore, synthetic generation pipelines have the potential to generate an unlimited number of images. The combination of high photorealism and scale turn synthetic data into a promising candidate for improving various machine learning (ML) pipelines. Thus far, a large body of research in this field has focused on using synthetic images for training, by augmenting and enlarging training data. In contrast to using synthetic data for training, in this work we explore whether synthetic data can be beneficial for model selection. Considering the task of image classification, we demonstrate that when data is scarce, synthetic data can be used to replace the held out validation set, thus allowing to train on a larger dataset. We also introduce a novel method to calibrate the synthetic error estimation to fit that of the real domain. We show that such calibration significantly improves the usefulness of synthetic data for model selection.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shoshan23a	Alon Shoshan, Nadav Bhonker, Igor Kviatkovsky, Matan Fintz, Gerard Medioni
Exphormer: Sparse Transformers for Graphs	Graph transformers have emerged as a promising architecture for a variety of graph learning and representation tasks. Despite their successes, though, it remains challenging to scale graph transformers to large graphs while maintaining accuracy competitive with message-passing networks. In this paper, we introduce Exphormer, a framework for building powerful and scalable graph transformers. Exphormer consists of a sparse attention mechanism based on two mechanisms: virtual global nodes and expander graphs, whose mathematical characteristics, such as spectral expansion, pseduorandomness, and sparsity, yield graph transformers with complexity only linear in the size of the graph, while allowing us to prove desirable theoretical properties of the resulting transformer models. We show that incorporating Exphormer into the recently-proposed GraphGPS framework produces models with competitive empirical results on a wide variety of graph datasets, including state-of-the-art results on three datasets. We also show that Exphormer can scale to datasets on larger graphs than shown in previous graph transformer architectures.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shirzad23a	Hamed Shirzad, Ameya Velingker, Balaji Venkatachalam, Danica J.

Generative Causal Representation Learning for Out-of-Distribution Motion Forecasting	Conventional supervised learning methods typically assume i.i.d samples and are found to be sensitive to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We propose Generative Causal Representation Learning (GCRL) which leverages causality to facilitate knowledge transfer under distribution shifts. While we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method in human trajectory prediction models, GCRL can be applied to other domains as well. First, we propose a novel causal model that explains the generative factors in motion forecasting datasets using features that are common across all environments and with features that are specific to each environment. Selection variables are used to determine which parts of the model can be directly transferred to a new environment without fine-tuning. Second, we propose an end-to-end variational learning paradigm to learn the causal mechanisms that generate observations from features. GCRL is supported by strong theoretical results that imply identifiability of the causal model under certain assumptions. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world motion forecasting datasets show the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed method for knowledge transfer under zero-shot and low-shot settings by substantially outperforming the prior motion forecasting models on out-of-distribution prediction.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shirahmad-gale-bagi23a	Shayan Shirahmad Gale Bagi, Zahra Gharaee, Oliver Schulte, Mark Crowley

One-shot Imitation in a Non-Stationary Environment via Multi-Modal Skill	One-shot imitation is to learn a new task from a single demonstration, yet it is a challenging problem to adopt it for complex tasks with the high domain diversity inherent in a non-stationary environment. To tackle the problem, we explore the compositionality of complex tasks, and present a novel skill-based imitation learning framework enabling one-shot imitation and zero-shot adaptation; from a single demonstration for a complex unseen task, a semantic skill sequence is inferred and then each skill in the sequence is converted into an action sequence optimized for environmental hidden dynamics that can vary over time. Specifically, we leverage a vision-language model to learn a semantic skill set from offline video datasets, where each skill is represented on the vision-language embedding space, and adapt meta-learning with dynamics inference to enable zero-shot skill adaptation. We evaluate our framework with various one-shot imitation scenarios for extended multi-stage Meta-world tasks, showing its superiority in learning complex tasks, generalizing to dynamics changes, and extending to different demonstration conditions and modalities, compared to other baselines.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shin23d	Sangwoo Shin, Daehee Lee, Minjong Yoo, Woo Kyung Kim, Honguk Woo
Improved Learning-Augmented Algorithms for the Multi-Option Ski Rental Problem via Best-Possible Competitive Analysis	In this paper, we present improved learning-augmented algorithms for the multi-option ski rental problem. Learning-augmented algorithms take ML predictions as an added part of the input and incorporates these predictions in solving the given problem. Due to their unique strength that combines the power of ML predictions with rigorous performance guarantees, they have been extensively studied in the context of online optimization problems. Even though ski rental problems are one of the canonical problems in the field of online optimization, only deterministic algorithms were previously known for multi-option ski rental, with or without learning augmentation. We present the first randomized learning-augmented algorithm for this problem, surpassing previous performance guarantees given by deterministic algorithms. Our learning-augmented algorithm is based on a new, provably best-possible randomized competitive algorithm for the problem. Our results are further complemented by lower bounds for deterministic and randomized algorithms, and computational experiments evaluating our algorithms' performance improvements.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shin23c	Yongho Shin, Changyeol Lee, Gukryeol Lee, Hyung-Chan An
MetricGAN-OKD: Multi-Metric Optimization of MetricGAN via Online Knowledge Distillation for Speech Enhancement	In speech enhancement, MetricGAN-based approaches reduce the discrepancy between the $L_p$ loss and evaluation metrics by utilizing a non-differentiable evaluation metric as the objective function. However, optimizing multiple metrics simultaneously remains challenging owing to the problem of confusing gradient directions. In this paper, we propose an effective multi-metric optimization method in MetricGAN via online knowledge distillation—MetricGAN-OKD. MetricGAN-OKD, which consists of multiple generators and target metrics, related by a one-to-one correspondence, enables generators to learn with respect to a single metric reliably while improving performance with respect to other metrics by mimicking other generators. Experimental results on speech enhancement and listening enhancement tasks reveal that the proposed method significantly improves performance in terms of multiple metrics compared to existing multi-metric optimization methods. Further, the good performance of MetricGAN-OKD is explained in terms of network generalizability and correlation between metrics.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shin23b	Wooseok Shin, Byung Hoon Lee, Jin Sob Kim, Hyun Joon Park, Sung Won Han
A Closer Look at the Intervention Procedure of Concept Bottleneck Models	Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are a class of interpretable neural network models that predict the target response of a given input based on its high-level concepts. Unlike the standard end-to-end models, CBMs enable domain experts to intervene on the predicted concepts and rectify any mistakes at test time, so that more accurate task predictions can be made at the end. While such intervenability provides a powerful avenue of control, many aspects of the intervention procedure remain rather unexplored. In this work, we develop various ways of selecting intervening concepts to improve the intervention effectiveness and conduct an array of in-depth analyses as to how they evolve under different circumstances. Specifically, we find that an informed intervention strategy can reduce the task error more than ten times compared to the current baseline under the same amount of intervention counts in realistic settings, and yet, this can vary quite significantly when taking into account different intervention granularity. We verify our findings through comprehensive evaluations, not only on the standard real datasets, but also on synthetic datasets that we generate based on a set of different causal graphs. We further discover some major pitfalls of the current practices which, without a proper addressing, raise concerns on reliability and fairness of the intervention procedure.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shin23a	Sungbin Shin, Yohan Jo, Sungsoo Ahn, Namhoon Lee
SNeRL: Semantic-aware Neural Radiance Fields for Reinforcement Learning	As previous representations for reinforcement learning cannot effectively incorporate a human-intuitive understanding of the 3D environment, they usually suffer from sub-optimal performances. In this paper, we present Semantic-aware Neural Radiance Fields for Reinforcement Learning (SNeRL), which jointly optimizes semantic-aware neural radiance fields (NeRF) with a convolutional encoder to learn 3D-aware neural implicit representation from multi-view images. We introduce 3D semantic and distilled feature fields in parallel to the RGB radiance fields in NeRF to learn semantic and object-centric representation for reinforcement learning. SNeRL outperforms not only previous pixel-based representations but also recent 3D-aware representations both in model-free and model-based reinforcement learning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shim23a	Dongseok Shim, Seungjae Lee, H.

Gradient Descent in Neural Networks as Sequential Learning in Reproducing Kernel Banach Space	The study of Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) has provided much needed insight into convergence and generalization properties of neural networks in the over-parametrized (wide) limit by approximating the network using a first-order Taylor expansion with respect to its weights in the neighborhood of their initialization values. This allows neural network training to be analyzed from the perspective of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), which is informative in the over-parametrized regime, but a poor approximation for narrower networks as the weights change more during training. Our goal is to extend beyond the limits of NTK toward a more general theory. We construct an exact power-series representation of the neural network in a finite neighborhood of the initial weights as an inner product of two feature maps, respectively from data and weight-step space, to feature space, allowing neural network training to be analyzed from the perspective of reproducing kernel Banach space (RKBS). We prove that, regardless of width, the training sequence produced by gradient descent can be exactly replicated by regularized sequential learning in RKBS. Using this, we present novel bound on uniform convergence where the iterations count and learning rate play a central role, giving new theoretical insight into neural network training.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shilton23a	Alistair Shilton, Sunil Gupta, Santu Rana, Svetha Venkatesh

In this work, we aim to understand and generalize CL from a point set matching perspective, instead of the comparison between two points. Specifically, we formulate CL as a form of inverse optimal transport (IOT), which involves a bilevel optimization procedure for learning where the outter minimization aims to learn the representations and the inner is to learn the coupling (i.e. the probability of matching matrix) between the point sets. Specifically, by adjusting the relaxation degree of constraints in the inner minimization, we obtain three contrastive losses and show that the dominant contrastive loss in literature InfoNCE falls into one of these losses. This reveals a new and more general algorithmic framework for CL. Additionally, the soft matching scheme in IOT induces a uniformity penalty to enhance representation learning which is akin to the CL's uniformity. Results on vision benchmarks show the effectiveness of our derived loss family and the new uniformity term.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shi23j	Liangliang Shi, Gu Zhang, Haoyu Zhen, Jintao Fan, Junchi Yan

Provably Efficient Offline Reinforcement Learning with Perturbed Data Sources	Existing theoretical studies on offline reinforcement learning (RL) mostly consider a dataset sampled directly from the target task. In practice, however, data often come from several heterogeneous but related sources. Motivated by this gap, this work aims at rigorously understanding offline RL with multiple datasets that are collected from randomly perturbed versions of the target task instead of from itself. An information-theoretic lower bound is derived, which reveals a necessary requirement on the number of involved sources in addition to that on the number of data samples. Then, a novel HetPEVI algorithm is proposed, which simultaneously considers the sample uncertainties from a finite number of data samples per data source and the source uncertainties due to a finite number of available data sources. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that HetPEVI can solve the target task as long as the data sources collectively provide a good data coverage. Moreover, HetPEVI is demonstrated to be optimal up to a polynomial factor of the horizon length. Finally, the study is extended to offline Markov games and offline robust RL, which demonstrates the generality of the proposed designs and theoretical analyses.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shi23h	Chengshuai Shi, Wei Xiong, Cong Shen, Jing Yang
Statistical Inference on Multi-armed Bandits with Delayed Feedback	Multi armed bandit (MAB) algorithms have been increasingly used to complement or integrate with A/B tests and randomized clinical trials in e-commerce, healthcare, and policymaking. Recent developments incorporate possible delayed feedback. While existing MAB literature often focuses on maximizing the expected cumulative reward outcomes (or, equivalently, regret minimization), few efforts have been devoted to establish valid statistical inference approaches to quantify the uncertainty of learned policies. We attempt to fill this gap by providing a unified statistical inference framework for policy evaluation where a target policy is allowed to differ from the data collecting policy, and our framework allows delay to be associated with the treatment arms. We present an adaptively weighted estimator that on one hand incorporates the arm-dependent delaying mechanism to achieve consistency, and on the other hand mitigates the variance inflation across stages due to vanishing sampling probability. In particular, our estimator does not critically depend on the ability to estimate the unknown delay mechanism. Under appropriate conditions, we prove that our estimator converges to a normal distribution as the number of time points goes to infinity, which provides guarantees for large-sample statistical inference. We illustrate the finite-sample performance of our approach through Monte Carlo experiments.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shi23g	Lei Shi, Jingshen Wang, Tianhao Wu
Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory	Efficiently capturing the long-range patterns in sequential data sources salient to a given task—such as classification and generative modeling—poses a fundamental challenge. Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $O(N \log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shi23f	Jiaxin Shi, Ke Alexander Wang, Emily Fox
UPop: Unified and Progressive Pruning for Compressing Vision-Language Transformers	Real-world data contains a vast amount of multimodal information, among which vision and language are the two most representative modalities. Moreover, increasingly heavier models, e.g., Transformers, have attracted the attention of researchers to model compression. However, how to compress multimodal models, especially vison-language Transformers, is still under-explored. This paper proposes the Unified and Progressive Pruning (UPop) as a universal vison-language Transformer compression framework, which incorporates 1) unifiedly searching multimodal subnets in a continuous optimization space from the original model, which enables automatic assignment of pruning ratios among compressible modalities and structures; 2) progressively searching and retraining the subnet, which maintains convergence between the search and retrain to attain higher compression ratios. Experiments on various tasks, datasets, and model architectures demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed UPop framework. The code is available at https://github.com/sdc17/UPop.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shi23e	Dachuan Shi, Chaofan Tao, Ying Jin, Zhendong Yang, Chun Yuan, Jiaqi Wang
Improving the Model Consistency of Decentralized Federated Learning	To mitigate the privacy leakages and communication burdens of Federated Learning (FL), decentralized FL (DFL) discards the central server and each client only communicates with its neighbors in a decentralized communication network. However, existing DFL suffers from high inconsistency among local clients, which results in severe distribution shift and inferior performance compared with centralized FL (CFL), especially on heterogeneous data or sparse communication topologies. To alleviate this issue, we propose two DFL algorithms named DFedSAM and DFedSAM-MGS to improve the performance of DFL. Specifically, DFedSAM leverages gradient perturbation to generate local flat models via Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM), which searches for models with uniformly low loss values. DFedSAM-MGS further boosts DFedSAM by adopting Multiple Gossip Steps (MGS) for better model consistency, which accelerates the aggregation of local flat models and better balances communication complexity and generalization. Theoretically, we present improved convergence rates $\small \mathcal{O}\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{KT}}+\frac{1}{T}+\frac{1}{K^{1/2}T^{3/2}(1-\lambda)^2}\big)$ and $\small \mathcal{O}\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{KT}}+\frac{1}{T}+\frac{\lambda^Q+1}{K^{1/2}T^{3/2}(1-\lambda^Q)^2}\big)$ in non-convex setting for DFedSAM and DFedSAM-MGS, respectively, where $1-\lambda$ is the spectral gap of gossip matrix and $Q$ is the number of MGS. Empirically, our methods can achieve competitive performance compared with CFL methods and outperform existing DFL methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shi23d	Yifan Shi, Li Shen, Kang Wei, Yan Sun, Bo Yuan, Xueqian Wang, Dacheng Tao
A Near-Optimal Algorithm for Safe Reinforcement Learning Under Instantaneous Hard Constraints	"In many applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL), it is critically important that the algorithm performs safely, such that instantaneous hard constraints are satisfied at each step, and unsafe states and actions are avoided. However, existing algorithms for ""safe"" RL are often designed under constraints that either require expected cumulative costs to be bounded or assume all states are safe. Thus, such algorithms could violate instantaneous hard constraints and traverse unsafe states (and actions) in practice. Hence, in this paper, we develop the first near-optimal safe RL algorithm for episodic Markov Decision Processes with unsafe states and actions under instantaneous hard constraints and the linear mixture model. It achieves a regret $\tilde{O}(\frac{d H^3 \sqrt{d K}}{\Delta_c})$ that nearly matches the state-of-the-art regret in the setting with only unsafe actions and that in the unconstrained setting, and is safe at each step, where $d$ is the feature-mapping dimension, $K$ is the number of episodes, $H$ is the episode length, and $\Delta_c$ is a safety-related parameter. We also provide a lower bound $\tilde{\Omega}(\max\{d H \sqrt{K}, \frac{H}{\Delta_c^2}\})$, which indicates that the dependency on $\Delta_c$ is necessary. Further, both our algorithm design and regret analysis involve several novel ideas, which may be of independent interest."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shi23c	Ming Shi, Yingbin Liang, Ness Shroff
Everyone’s Preference Changes Differently: A Weighted Multi-Interest Model For Retrieval	User embeddings (vectorized representations of a user) are essential in recommendation systems. Numerous approaches have been proposed to construct a representation for the user in order to find similar items for retrieval tasks, and they have been proven effective in industrial recommendation systems. Recently people have discovered the power of using multiple embeddings to represent a user, with the hope that each embedding represents the user's interest in a certain topic. With multi-interest representation, it's important to model the user's preference over the different topics and how the preference changes with time. However, existing approaches either fail to estimate the user's affinity to each interest or unreasonably assume every interest of every user fades at an equal rate with time, thus hurting the performance of candidate retrieval. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Interest Preference (MIP) model, an approach that not only produces multi-interest for users by using the user's sequential engagement more effectively but also automatically learns a set of weights to represent the preference over each embedding so that the candidates can be retrieved from each interest proportionally. Extensive experiments have been done on various industrial-scale datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shi23b	Hui Shi, Yupeng Gu, Yitong Zhou, Bo Zhao, Sicun Gao, Jishen Zhao

Fundamental Limits of Two-layer Autoencoders, and Achieving Them with Gradient Methods	Autoencoders are a popular model in many branches of machine learning and lossy data compression. However, their fundamental limits, the performance of gradient methods and the features learnt during optimization remain poorly understood, even in the two-layer setting. In fact, earlier work has considered either linear autoencoders or specific training regimes (leading to vanishing or diverging compression rates). Our paper addresses this gap by focusing on non-linear two-layer autoencoders trained in the challenging proportional regime in which the input dimension scales linearly with the size of the representation. Our results characterize the minimizers of the population risk, and show that such minimizers are achieved by gradient methods; their structure is also unveiled, thus leading to a concise description of the features obtained via training. For the special case of a sign activation function, our analysis establishes the fundamental limits for the lossy compression of Gaussian sources via (shallow) autoencoders. Finally, while the results are proved for Gaussian data, numerical simulations on standard datasets display the universality of the theoretical predictions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shevchenko23a	Aleksandr Shevchenko, Kevin Kögler, Hamed Hassani, Marco Mondelli
Improved Regret for Efficient Online Reinforcement Learning with Linear Function Approximation	We study reinforcement learning with linear function approximation and adversarially changing cost functions, a setup that has mostly been considered under simplifying assumptions such as full information feedback or exploratory conditions. We present a computationally efficient policy optimization algorithm for the challenging general setting of unknown dynamics and bandit feedback, featuring a combination of mirror-descent and least squares policy evaluation in an auxiliary MDP used to compute exploration bonuses. Our algorithm obtains an $\widetilde O(K^{6/7})$ regret bound, improving significantly over previous state-of-the-art of $\widetilde O (K^{14/15})$ in this setting. In addition, we present a version of the same algorithm under the assumption a simulator of the environment is available to the learner (but otherwise no exploratory assumptions are made), and prove it obtains state-of-the-art regret of $\widetilde O (K^{2/3})$.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sherman23a	Uri Sherman, Tomer Koren, Yishay Mansour
FlexGen: High-Throughput Generative Inference of Large Language Models with a Single GPU	The high computational and memory requirements of large language model (LLM) inference make it feasible only with multiple high-end accelerators. Motivated by the emerging demand for latency-insensitive tasks with batched processing, this paper initiates the study of high-throughput LLM inference using limited resources, such as a single commodity GPU. We present FlexGen, a high-throughput generation engine for running LLMs with limited GPU memory. FlexGen can be flexibly configured under various hardware resource constraints by aggregating memory and computation from the GPU, CPU, and disk. By solving a linear programming problem, it searches for efficient patterns to store and access tensors. FlexGen further compresses the weights and the attention cache to 4 bits with negligible accuracy loss. These techniques enable FlexGen to have a larger space of batch size choices and thus significantly increase maximum throughput. As a result, when running OPT-175B on a single 16GB GPU, FlexGen achieves significantly higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art offloading systems, reaching a generation throughput of 1 token/s for the first time with an effective batch size of 144. On the HELM benchmark, FlexGen can benchmark a 30B model with a 16GB GPU on 7 representative sub-scenarios in 21 hours.

TGRL: An Algorithm for Teacher Guided Reinforcement Learning	We consider solving sequential decision-making problems in the scenario where the agent has access to two supervision sources: $\textit{reward signal}$ and a $\textit{teacher}$ that can be queried to obtain a $\textit{good}$ action for any state encountered by the agent. Learning solely from rewards, or reinforcement learning, is data inefficient and may not learn high-reward policies in challenging scenarios involving sparse rewards or partial observability. On the other hand, learning from a teacher may sometimes be infeasible. For instance, the actions provided by a teacher with privileged information may be unlearnable by an agent with limited information (i.e., partial observability). In other scenarios, the teacher might be sub-optimal, and imitating their actions can limit the agent's performance. To overcome these challenges, prior work proposed to jointly optimize imitation and reinforcement learning objectives but relied on heuristics and problem-specific hyper-parameter tuning to balance the two objectives. We introduce Teacher Guided Reinforcement Learning (TGRL), a principled approach to dynamically balance following the teacher's guidance and leveraging RL. TGRL outperforms strong baselines across diverse domains without hyperparameter tuning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shenfeld23a	Idan Shenfeld, Zhang-Wei Hong, Aviv Tamar, Pulkit Agrawal
Auxiliary Modality Learning with Generalized Curriculum Distillation	"Driven by the need from real-world applications, Auxiliary Modality Learning (AML) offers the possibility to utilize more information from auxiliary data in training, while only requiring data from one or fewer modalities in test, to save the overall computational cost and reduce the amount of input data for inferencing. In this work, we formally define ""Auxiliary Modality Learning"" (AML), systematically classify types of auxiliary modality (in visual computing) and architectures for AML, and analyze their performance. We also analyze the conditions under which AML works well from the optimization and data distribution perspectives. To guide various choices to achieve optimal performance using AML, we propose a novel method to assist in choosing the best auxiliary modality and estimating an upper bound performance before executing AML. In addition, we propose a new AML method using generalized curriculum distillation to enable more effective curriculum learning. Our method achieves the best performance compared to other SOTA methods."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shen23f	Yu Shen, Xijun Wang, Peng Gao, Ming Lin
Cross-Modal Fine-Tuning: Align then Refine	Fine-tuning large-scale pretrained models has led to tremendous progress in well-studied modalities such as vision and NLP. However, similar gains have not been observed in many other modalities due to a lack of relevant pretrained models. In this work, we propose ORCA, a general cross-modal fine-tuning framework that extends the applicability of a single large-scale pretrained model to diverse modalities. ORCA adapts to a target task via an align-then-refine workflow: given the target input, ORCA first learns an embedding network that aligns the embedded feature distribution with the pretraining modality. The pretrained model is then fine-tuned on the embedded data to exploit the knowledge shared across modalities. Through extensive experiments, we show that ORCA obtains state-of-the-art results on 3 benchmarks containing over 60 datasets from 12 modalities, outperforming a wide range of hand-designed, AutoML, general-purpose, and task-specific cross-modal methods. We highlight the importance of data alignment via a series of ablation studies and exemplify ORCA's utility in data-limited regimes.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shen23e	Junhong Shen, Liam Li, Lucio M.

Non-autoregressive Conditional Diffusion Models for Time Series Prediction	Recently, denoising diffusion models have led to significant breakthroughs in the generation of images, audio and text. However, it is still an open question on how to adapt their strong modeling ability to model time series. In this paper, we propose TimeDiff, a non-autoregressive diffusion model that achieves high-quality time series prediction with the introduction of two novel conditioning mechanisms: future mixup and autoregressive initialization. Similar to teacher forcing, future mixup allows parts of the ground-truth future predictions for conditioning, while autoregressive initialization helps better initialize the model with basic time series patterns such as short-term trends. Extensive experiments are performed on nine real-world datasets. Results show that TimeDiff consistently outperforms existing time series diffusion models, and also achieves the best overall performance across a variety of the existing strong baselines (including transformers and FiLM).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shen23d	Lifeng Shen, James Kwok
On Penalty-based Bilevel Gradient Descent Method	Bilevel optimization enjoys a wide range of applications in hyper-parameter optimization, meta-learning and reinforcement learning. However, bilevel problems are difficult to solve and recent progress on scalable bilevel algorithms mainly focuses on bilevel optimization problems where the lower-level objective is either strongly convex or unconstrained. In this work, we tackle the bilevel problem through the lens of the penalty method. We show that under certain conditions, the penalty reformulation recovers the solutions of the original bilevel problem. Further, we propose the penalty-based bilevel gradient descent algorithm and establish its finite-time convergence for the constrained bilevel problem without lower-level strong convexity. The experimental results showcase the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shen23c	Han Shen, Tianyi Chen
On Balancing Bias and Variance in Unsupervised Multi-Source-Free Domain Adaptation	Due to privacy, storage, and other constraints, there is a growing need for unsupervised domain adaptation techniques in machine learning that do not require access to the data used to train a collection of source models. Existing methods for multi-source-free domain adaptation (MSFDA) typically train a target model using pseudo-labeled data produced by the source models, which focus on improving the pseudo-labeling techniques or proposing new training objectives. Instead, we aim to analyze the fundamental limits of MSFDA. In particular, we develop an information-theoretic bound on the generalization error of the resulting target model, which illustrates an inherent bias-variance trade-off. We then provide insights on how to balance this trade-off from three perspectives, including domain aggregation, selective pseudo-labeling, and joint feature alignment, which leads to the design of novel algorithms. Experiments on multiple datasets validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the state-of-art performance of the proposed algorithm, especially on some of the most challenging datasets, including Office-Home and DomainNet.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shen23b	Maohao Shen, Yuheng Bu, Gregory W.

Towards Understanding and Improving GFlowNet Training	Generative flow networks (GFlowNets) are a family of algorithms that learn a generative policy to sample discrete objects $x$ with non-negative reward $R(x)$. Learning objectives guarantee the GFlowNet samples $x$ from the target distribution $p^*(x) \propto R(x)$ when loss is globally minimized over all states or trajectories, but it is unclear how well they perform with practical limits on training resources. We introduce an efficient evaluation strategy to compare the learned sampling distribution to the target reward distribution. As flows can be underdetermined given training data, we clarify the importance of learned flows to generalization and matching $p^*(x)$ in practice. We investigate how to learn better flows, and propose (i) prioritized replay training of high-reward $x$, (ii) relative edge flow policy parametrization, and (iii) a novel guided trajectory balance objective, and show how it can solve a substructure credit assignment problem. We substantially improve sample efficiency on biochemical design tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shen23a	Max W Shen, Emmanuel Bengio, Ehsan Hajiramezanali, Andreas Loukas, Kyunghyun Cho, Tommaso Biancalani
Cold Analysis of Rao-Blackwellized Straight-Through Gumbel-Softmax Gradient Estimator	Many problems in machine learning require an estimate of the gradient of an expectation in discrete random variables with respect to the sampling distribution. This work is motivated by the development of the Gumbel-Softmax family of estimators, which use a temperature-controlled relaxation of discrete variables. The state-of-the art in this family, the Gumbel-Rao estimator uses an extra internal sampling to reduce the variance, which may be costly. We analyze this estimator and show that it possesses a zero temperature limit with a surprisingly simple closed form. The limit estimator, called ZGR, has favorable bias and variance properties, it is easy to implement and computationally inexpensive. It decomposes as the average of the straight through (ST) estimator and DARN estimator — two basic but not very well performing on their own estimators. We demonstrate that the simple ST–ZGR family of estimators practically dominates in the bias-variance tradeoffs the whole GR family while also outperforming SOTA unbiased estimators.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shekhovtsov23a	Alexander Shekhovtsov
Sequential Changepoint Detection via Backward Confidence Sequences	"We present a simple reduction from sequential estimation to sequential changepoint detection (SCD). In short, suppose we are interested in detecting changepoints in some parameter or functional $\theta$ of the underlying distribution. We demonstrate that if we can construct a confidence sequence (CS) for $\theta$, then we can also successfully perform SCD for $\theta$. This is accomplished by checking if two CSs — one forwards and the other backwards — ever fail to intersect. Since the literature on CSs has been rapidly evolving recently, the reduction provided in this paper immediately solves several old and new change detection problems. Further, our ""backward CS"", constructed by reversing time, is new and potentially of independent interest. We provide strong nonasymptotic guarantees on the frequency of false alarms and detection delay, and demonstrate numerical effectiveness on several problems."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shekhar23a	Shubhanshu Shekhar, Aaditya Ramdas

In this paper we investigate the space of Gaussian probability paths, which includes diffusion paths as an instance, and look for an optimal member in some useful sense. In particular, minimizing the Kinetic Energy (KE) of a path is known to make particles' trajectories simple, hence easier to sample, and empirically improve performance in terms of likelihood of unseen data and sample generation quality. We investigate Kinetic Optimal (KO) Gaussian paths and offer the following observations: (i) We show the KE takes a simplified form on the space of Gaussian paths, where the data is incorporated only through a single, one dimensional scalar function, called the	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shaul23a	Neta Shaul, Ricky T.

Coin Sampling: Gradient-Based Bayesian Inference without Learning Rates	In recent years, particle-based variational inference (ParVI) methods such as Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) have grown in popularity as scalable methods for Bayesian inference. Unfortunately, the properties of such methods invariably depend on hyperparameters such as the learning rate, which must be carefully tuned by the practitioner in order to ensure convergence to the target measure at a suitable rate. In this paper, we introduce a suite of new particle-based methods for scalable Bayesian inference based on coin betting, which are entirely learning-rate free. We illustrate the performance of our approach on a range of numerical examples, including several high-dimensional models and datasets, demonstrating comparable performance to other ParVI algorithms with no need to tune a learning rate.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sharrock23a	Louis Sharrock, Christopher Nemeth
Toward Efficient Gradient-Based Value Estimation	Gradient-based methods for value estimation in reinforcement learning have favorable stability properties, but they are typically much slower than Temporal Difference (TD) learning methods. We study the root causes of this slowness and show that Mean Square Bellman Error (MSBE) is an ill-conditioned loss function in the sense that its Hessian has large condition-number. To resolve the adverse effect of poor conditioning of MSBE on gradient based methods, we propose a low complexity batch-free proximal method that approximately follows the Gauss-Newton direction and is asymptotically robust to parameterization. Our main algorithm, called RANS, is efficient in the sense that it is significantly faster than the residual gradient methods while having almost the same computational complexity, and is competitive with TD on the classic problems that we tested.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sharifnassab23a	Arsalan Sharifnassab, Richard S.

Regularization-free Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Nets	In time-series analysis, nonlinear temporal misalignment is a major problem that forestalls even simple averaging. An effective learning-based solution for this problem is the Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Net (DTAN), that, by relying on a diffeomorphic temporal transformer net and the amortization of the joint-alignment task, eliminates drawbacks of traditional alignment methods. Unfortunately, existing DTAN formulations crucially depend on a regularization term whose optimal hyperparameters are dataset-specific and usually searched via a large number of experiments. Here we propose a regularization-free DTAN that obviates the need to perform such an expensive, and often impractical, search. Concretely, we propose a new well-behaved loss that we call the Inverse Consistency Averaging Error (ICAE), as well as a related new triplet loss. Extensive experiments on 128 UCR datasets show that the proposed method outperforms contemporary methods despite not using a regularization. Moreover, ICAE also gives rise to the first DTAN that supports variable-length signals.

Complementary Attention for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning	"In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) shows great promise for a trade-off between independent Q-learning and joint action learning. However, vanilla CTDE methods assumed a fixed number of agents could hardly adapt to real-world scenarios where dynamic team compositions typically suffer from dramatically variant partial observability. Specifically, agents with extensive sight ranges are prone to be affected by trivial environmental substrates, dubbed the ""distracted attention"" issue; ones with limited observation can hardly sense their teammates, degrading the cooperation quality. In this paper, we propose Complementary Attention for Multi-Agent reinforcement learning (CAMA), which applies a divide-and-conquer strategy on input entities accompanied with the complementary attention of enhancement and replenishment. Concretely, to tackle the distracted attention issue, highly contributed entities' attention is enhanced by the execution-related representation extracted via action prediction with an inverse model. For better out-of-sight-range cooperation, the lowly contributed ones are compressed to brief messages with a conditional mutual information estimator. Our CAMA facilitates stable and sustainable teamwork, which is justified by the impressive results reported on the challenging StarCraftII, MPE, and Traffic Junction benchmarks."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shao23b	Jianzhun Shao, Hongchang Zhang, Yun Qu, Chang Liu, Shuncheng He, Yuhang Jiang, Xiangyang Ji
Synthetic Prompting: Generating Chain-of-Thought Demonstrations for Large Language Models	Large language models can perform various reasoning tasks by using chain-of-thought prompting, which guides them to find answers through step-by-step demonstrations. However, the quality of the prompts depends on the demonstrations given to the models, and creating many of them by hand is costly. We introduce Synthetic prompting, a method that leverages a few handcrafted examples to prompt the model to generate more examples by itself, and selects effective demonstrations to elicit better reasoning. Our method alternates between a backward and forward process to generate new examples. The backward process generates a question that match a sampled reasoning chain, so that the question is solvable and clear. The forward process produces a more detailed reasoning chain for the question, improving the quality of the example. We evaluate our method on numerical, symbolic, and algorithmic reasoning tasks, and show that it outperforms existing prompting techniques.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shao23a	Zhihong Shao, Yeyun Gong, Yelong Shen, Minlie Huang, Nan Duan, Weizhu Chen
Auxiliary Learning as an Asymmetric Bargaining Game	Auxiliary learning is an effective method for enhancing the generalization capabilities of trained models, particularly when dealing with small datasets. However, this approach may present several difficulties: (i) optimizing multiple objectives can be more challenging, and (ii) how to balance the auxiliary tasks to best assist the main task is unclear. In this work, we propose a novel approach, named AuxiNash, for balancing tasks in auxiliary learning by formalizing the problem as generalized bargaining game with asymmetric task bargaining power. Furthermore, we describe an efficient procedure for learning the bargaining power of tasks based on their contribution to the performance of the main task and derive theoretical guarantees for its convergence. Finally, we evaluate AuxiNash on multiple multi-task benchmarks and find that it consistently outperforms competing methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shamsian23a	Aviv Shamsian, Aviv Navon, Neta Glazer, Kenji Kawaguchi, Gal Chechik, Ethan Fetaya
ModelDiff: A Framework for Comparing Learning Algorithms	We study the problem of (learning) algorithm comparison, where the goal is to find differences between models trained with two different learning algorithms. We begin by formalizing this goal as one of finding distinguishing feature transformations, i.e., input transformations that change the predictions of models trained with one learning algorithm but not the other. We then present ModelDiff, a method that leverages the datamodels framework (Ilyas et al., 2022) to compare learning algorithms based on how they use their training data. We demonstrate ModelDiff through three case studies, comparing models trained with/without data augmentation, with/without pre-training, and with different SGD hyperparameters.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shah23a	Harshay Shah, Sung Min Park, Andrew Ilyas, Aleksander Madry
One-Shot Compression of Large Edge-Exchangeable Graphs using Bits-Back Coding	We present a one-shot method for compressing large labeled graphs called Random Edge Coding. When paired with a parameter-free model based on Pólya's Urn, the worst-case computational and memory complexities scale quasi-linearly and linearly with the number of observed edges, making it efficient on sparse graphs, and requires only integer arithmetic. Key to our method is bits-back coding, which is used to sample edges and vertices without replacement from the edge-list in a way that preserves the structure of the graph. Optimality is proven under a class of random graph models that are invariant to permutations of the edges and of vertices within an edge. Experiments indicate Random Edge Coding can achieve competitive compression performance on real-world network datasets and scales to graphs with millions of nodes and edges.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/severo23a	Daniel Severo, James Townsend, Ashish J Khisti, Alireza Makhzani
Multi-View Masked World Models for Visual Robotic Manipulation	Visual robotic manipulation research and applications often use multiple cameras, or views, to better perceive the world. How else can we utilize the richness of multi-view data? In this paper, we investigate how to learn good representations with multi-view data and utilize them for visual robotic manipulation. Specifically, we train a multi-view masked autoencoder which reconstructs pixels of randomly masked viewpoints and then learn a world model operating on the representations from the autoencoder. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in a range of scenarios, including multi-view control and single-view control with auxiliary cameras for representation learning. We also show that the multi-view masked autoencoder trained with multiple randomized viewpoints enables training a policy with strong viewpoint randomization and transferring the policy to solve real-robot tasks without camera calibration and an adaptation procedure.

Explainability as statistical inference	A wide variety of model explanation approaches have been proposed in recent years, all guided by very different rationales and heuristics. In this paper, we take a new route and cast interpretability as a statistical inference problem. We propose a general deep probabilistic model designed to produce interpretable predictions. The model's parameters can be learned via maximum likelihood, and the method can be adapted to any predictor network architecture, and any type of prediction problem. Our model is akin to amortized interpretability methods, where a neural network is used as a selector to allow for fast interpretation at inference time. Several popular interpretability methods are shown to be particular cases of regularized maximum likelihood for our general model. Using our framework, we identify imputation as a common issue of these models. We propose new datasets with ground truth selection which allow for the evaluation of the features importance map and show experimentally that multiple imputation provides more reasonable interpretations.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/senetaire23a	Hugo Henri Joseph Senetaire, Damien Garreau, Jes Frellsen, Pierre-Alexandre Mattei
Incentivizing Exploration with Linear Contexts and Combinatorial Actions	We advance the study of incentivized bandit exploration, in which arm choices are viewed as recommendations and are required to be Bayesian incentive compatible. Recent work of Sellke-Slivkins (Operations Research 2022) has shown that for the special case of independent arms, after collecting enough initial samples, the popular Thompson sampling algorithm becomes incentive compatible. This was generalized to the combinatorial semibandit in Hu-Ngo-Slivkins-Wu (NeurIPS 2022). We give an analog of this result for linear bandits, where the independence of the prior is replaced by a natural convexity condition. This opens up the possibility of efficient and regret-optimal incentivized exploration in high-dimensional action spaces. In the semibandit model, we also improve the sample complexity for the pre-Thompson sampling phase of initial data collection.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sellke23a	Mark Sellke
Bayesian online change point detection with Hilbert space approximate Student-t process	In this paper, we introduce a variant of Bayesian online change point detection with a reducedrank Student-t process (TP) and dependent Student-t noise, as a nonparametric time series model. Our method builds and improves upon the state-of-the-art Gaussian process (GP) change point model benchmark of Saatci et al. (2010). The Student-t process generalizes the concept of a GP and hence yields a more flexible alternative. Additionally, unlike a GP, the predictive variance explicitly depends on the training observations, while the use of an entangled Student-t noise model preserves analytical tractability. Our approach also uses a Hilbert space reduced-rank representation of the TP kernel, derived from an eigenfunction expansion of the Laplace operator (Solin & Sarkka, 2020), to alleviate its computational complexity. Improvements in prediction and training time are demonstrated with real-world data-sets	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sellier23a	Jeremy Sellier, Petros Dellaportas
Neural Markov Jump Processes	Markov jump processes are continuous-time stochastic processes with a wide range of applications in both natural and social sciences. Despite their widespread use, inference in these models is highly non-trivial and typically proceeds via either Monte Carlo or expectation-maximization methods. In this work we introduce an alternative, variational inference algorithm for Markov jump processes which relies on neural ordinary differential equations, and is trainable via back-propagation. Our methodology learns neural, continuous-time representations of the observed data, that are used to approximate the initial distribution and time-dependent transition probability rates of the posterior Markov jump process. The time-independent rates of the prior process are in contrast trained akin to generative adversarial networks. We test our approach on synthetic data sampled from ground-truth Markov jump processes, experimental switching ion channel data and molecular dynamics simulations. Source code to reproduce our experiments is available online.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/seifner23a	Patrick Seifner, Ramses J Sanchez
Variational Autoencoding Neural Operators	Unsupervised learning with functional data is an emerging paradigm of machine learning research with applications to computer vision, climate modeling and physical systems. A natural way of modeling functional data is by learning operators between infinite dimensional spaces, leading to discretization invariant representations that scale independently of the sample grid resolution. Here we present Variational Autoencoding Neural Operators (VANO), a general strategy for making a large class of operator learning architectures act as variational autoencoders. For this purpose, we provide a novel rigorous mathematical formulation of the variational objective in function spaces for training. VANO first maps an input function to a distribution over a latent space using a parametric encoder and then decodes a sample from the latent distribution to reconstruct the input, as in classic variational autoencoders. We test VANO with different model set-ups and architecture choices for a variety of benchmarks. We start from a simple Gaussian random field where we can analytically track what the model learns and progressively transition to more challenging benchmarks including modeling phase separation in Cahn-Hilliard systems and real world satellite data for measuring Earth surface deformation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/seidman23a	Jacob H Seidman, Georgios Kissas, George J.

Enhancing Activity Prediction Models in Drug Discovery with the Ability to Understand Human Language	Activity and property prediction models are the central workhorses in drug discovery and materials sciences, but currently, they have to be trained or fine-tuned for new tasks. Without training or fine-tuning, scientific language models could be used for such low-data tasks through their announced zero- and few-shot capabilities. However, their predictive quality at activity prediction is lacking. In this work, we envision a novel type of activity prediction model that is able to adapt to new prediction tasks at inference time, via understanding textual information describing the task. To this end, we propose a new architecture with separate modules for chemical and natural language inputs, and a contrastive pretraining objective on data from large biochemical databases. In extensive experiments, we show that our method CLAMP yields improved predictive performance on few-shot learning benchmarks and zero-shot problems in drug discovery. We attribute the advances of our method to the modularized architecture and to our pre-training objective.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/seidl23a	Philipp Seidl, Andreu Vall, Sepp Hochreiter, Günter Klambauer
Double-Weighting for Covariate Shift Adaptation	Supervised learning is often affected by a covariate shift in which the marginal distributions of instances (covariates $x$) of training and testing samples $p_\text{tr}(x)$ and $p_\text{te}(x)$ are different but the label conditionals coincide. Existing approaches address such covariate shift by either using the ratio $p_\text{te}(x)/p_\text{tr}(x)$ to weight training samples (reweighted methods) or using the ratio $p_\text{tr}(x)/p_\text{te}(x)$ to weight testing samples (robust methods). However, the performance of such approaches can be poor under support mismatch or when the above ratios take large values. We propose a minimax risk classification (MRC) approach for covariate shift adaptation that avoids such limitations by weighting both training and testing samples. In addition, we develop effective techniques that obtain both sets of weights and generalize the conventional kernel mean matching method. We provide novel generalization bounds for our method that show a significant increase in the effective sample size compared with reweighted methods. The proposed method also achieves enhanced classification performance in both synthetic and empirical experiments.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/segovia-martin23a	Jose Ignacio Segovia Martin, Santiago Mazuelas, Anqi Liu
A Fast Optimistic Method for Monotone Variational Inequalities	We study monotone variational inequalities that can arise as optimality conditions for constrained convex optimization or convex-concave minimax problems and propose a novel algorithm that uses only one gradient/operator evaluation and one projection onto the constraint set per iteration. The algorithm, which we call fOGDA-VI, achieves a $o(\frac{1}{k})$ rate of convergence in terms of the restricted gap function as well as the natural residual for the last iterate. Moreover, we provide a convergence guarantee for the sequence of iterates to a solution of the variational inequality. These are the best theoretical convergence results for numerical methods for (only) monotone variational inequalities reported in the literature. To empirically validate our algorithm we investigate a two-player matrix game with mixed strategies of the two players. Concluding, we show promising results regarding the application of fOGDA-VI to the training of generative adversarial nets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sedlmayer23a	Michael Sedlmayer, Dang-Khoa Nguyen, Radu Ioan Bot
Dissecting the Effects of SGD Noise in Distinct Regimes of Deep Learning	Understanding when the noise in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) affects generalization of deep neural networks remains a challenge, complicated by the fact that networks can operate in distinct training regimes. Here we study how the magnitude of this noise $T$ affects performance as the size of the training set $P$ and the scale of initialization $\alpha$ are varied. For gradient descent, $\alpha$ is a key parameter that controls if the network is lazy' ($\alpha\gg1$) or instead learns features ($\alpha\ll1$). For classification of MNIST and CIFAR10 images, our central results are: *(i)* obtaining phase diagrams for performance in the $(\alpha,T)$ plane. They show that SGD noise can be detrimental or instead useful depending on the training regime. Moreover, although increasing $T$ or decreasing $\alpha$ both allow the net to escape the lazy regime, these changes can have opposite effects on performance. *(ii)* Most importantly, we find that the characteristic temperature $T_c$ where the noise of SGD starts affecting the trained model (and eventually performance) is a power law of $P$. We relate this finding with the observation that key dynamical quantities, such as the total variation of weights during training, depend on both $T$ and $P$ as power laws. These results indicate that a key effect of SGD noise occurs late in training, by affecting the stopping process whereby all data are fitted. Indeed, we argue that due to SGD noise, nets must develop a strongersignal', i.e. larger informative weights, to fit the data, leading to a longer training time. A stronger signal and a longer training time are also required when the size of the training set $P$ increases. We confirm these views in the perceptron model, where signal and noise can be precisely measured. Interestingly, exponents characterizing the effect of SGD depend on the density of data near the decision boundary, as we explain.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sclocchi23a	Antonio Sclocchi, Mario Geiger, Matthieu Wyart
Bigger, Better, Faster: Human-level Atari with human-level efficiency	We introduce a value-based RL agent, which we call BBF, that achieves super-human performance in the Atari 100K benchmark. BBF relies on scaling the neural networks used for value estimation, as well as a number of other design choices that enable this scaling in a sample-efficient manner. We conduct extensive analyses of these design choices and provide insights for future work. We end with a discussion about updating the goalposts for sample-efficient RL research on the ALE. We make our code and data publicly available at https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/bigger_better_faster.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/schwarzer23a	Max Schwarzer, Johan Samir Obando Ceron, Aaron Courville, Marc G Bellemare, Rishabh Agarwal, Pablo Samuel Castro
Modality-Agnostic Variational Compression of Implicit Neural Representations	We introduce a modality-agnostic neural compression algorithm based on a functional view of data and parameterised as an Implicit Neural Representation (INR). Bridging the gap between latent coding and sparsity, we obtain compact latent representations non-linearly mapped to a soft gating mechanism. This allows the specialisation of a shared INR network to each data item through subnetwork selection. After obtaining a dataset of such latent representations, we directly optimise the rate/distortion trade-off in a modality-agnostic space using neural compression. Variational Compression of Implicit Neural Representations (VC-INR) shows improved performance given the same representational capacity pre quantisation while also outperforming previous quantisation schemes used for other INR techniques.Our experiments demonstrate strong results over a large set of diverse modalities using the same algorithm without any modality-specific inductive biases. We show results on images, climate data, 3D shapes and scenes as well as audio and video, introducing VC-INR as the first INR-based method to outperform codecs as well-known and diverse as JPEG 2000, MP3 and AVC/HEVC on their respective modalities.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/schwarz23a	Jonathan Richard Schwarz, Jihoon Tack, Yee Whye Teh, Jaeho Lee, Jinwoo Shin
The Acquisition of Physical Knowledge in Generative Neural Networks	As children grow older, they develop an intuitive understanding of the physical processes around them. Their physical understanding develops in stages, moving along developmental trajectories which have been mapped out extensively in previous empirical research. Here, we investigate how the learning trajectories of deep generative neural networks compare to children's developmental trajectories using physical understanding as a testbed. We outline an approach that allows us to examine two distinct hypotheses of human development – stochastic optimization and complexity increase. We find that while our models are able to accurately predict a number of physical processes, their learning trajectories under both hypotheses do not follow the developmental trajectories of children.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/schulze-buschoff23a	Luca M.

Deterministic equivalent and error universality of deep random features learning	This manuscript considers the problem of learning a random Gaussian network function using a fully connected network with frozen intermediate layers and trainable readout layer. This problem can be seen as a natural generalization of the widely studied random features model to deeper architectures. First, we prove Gaussian universality of the test error in a ridge regression setting where the learner and target networks share the same intermediate layers, and provide a sharp asymptotic formula for it. Establishing this result requires proving a deterministic equivalent for traces of the deep random features sample covariance matrices which can be of independent interest. Second, we conjecture the asymptotic Gaussian universality of the test error in the more general setting of arbitrary convex losses and generic learner/target architectures. We provide extensive numerical evidence for this conjecture, which requires the derivation of closed-form expressions for the layer-wise post-activation population covariances. In light of our results, we investigate the interplay between architecture design and implicit regularization.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/schroder23a	Dominik Schröder, Hugo Cui, Daniil Dmitriev, Bruno Loureiro
Learning Expressive Priors for Generalization and Uncertainty Estimation in Neural Networks	In this work, we propose a novel prior learning method for advancing generalization and uncertainty estimation in deep neural networks. The key idea is to exploit scalable and structured posteriors of neural networks as informative priors with generalization guarantees. Our learned priors provide expressive probabilistic representations at large scale, like Bayesian counterparts of pre-trained models on ImageNet, and further produce non-vacuous generalization bounds. We also extend this idea to a continual learning framework, where the favorable properties of our priors are desirable. Major enablers are our technical contributions: (1) the sums-of-Kronecker-product computations, and (2) the derivations and optimizations of tractable objectives that lead to improved generalization bounds. Empirically, we exhaustively show the effectiveness of this method for uncertainty estimation and generalization.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/schnaus23a	Dominik Schnaus, Jongseok Lee, Daniel Cremers, Rudolph Triebel
Identifiability and Generalizability in Constrained Inverse Reinforcement Learning	Two main challenges in Reinforcement Learning (RL) are designing appropriate reward functions and ensuring the safety of the learned policy. To address these challenges, we present a theoretical framework for Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) in constrained Markov decision processes. From a convex-analytic perspective, we extend prior results on reward identifiability and generalizability to both the constrained setting and a more general class of regularizations. In particular, we show that identifiability up to potential shaping (Cao et al., 2021) is a consequence of entropy regularization and may generally no longer hold for other regularizations or in the presence of safety constraints. We also show that to ensure generalizability to new transition laws and constraints, the true reward must be identified up to a constant. Additionally, we derive a finite sample guarantee for the suboptimality of the learned rewards, and validate our results in a gridworld environment.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/schlaginhaufen23a	Andreas Schlaginhaufen, Maryam Kamgarpour
Gibbsian Polar Slice Sampling	Polar slice sampling (Roberts & Rosenthal, 2002) is a Markov chain approach for approximate sampling of distributions that is difficult, if not impossible, to implement efficiently, but behaves provably well with respect to the dimension. By updating the directional and radial components of chain iterates separately, we obtain a family of samplers that mimic polar slice sampling, and yet can be implemented efficiently. Numerical experiments in a variety of settings indicate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the two most closely related approaches, elliptical slice sampling (Murray et al., 2010) and hit-and-run uniform slice sampling (MacKay, 2003). We prove the well-definedness and convergence of our methods under suitable assumptions on the target distribution.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/schar23a	Philip Schär, Michael Habeck, Daniel Rudolf
Off-Policy Average Reward Actor-Critic with Deterministic Policy Search	The average reward criterion is relatively less studied as most existing works in the Reinforcement Learning literature consider the discounted reward criterion. There are few recent works that present on-policy average reward actor-critic algorithms, but average reward off-policy actor-critic is relatively less explored. In this work, we present both on-policy and off-policy deterministic policy gradient theorems for the average reward performance criterion. Using these theorems, we also present an Average Reward Off-Policy Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (ARO-DDPG) Algorithm. We first show asymptotic convergence analysis using the ODE-based method. Subsequently, we provide a finite time analysis of the resulting stochastic approximation scheme with linear function approximator and obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal stationary policy with a sample complexity of $\Omega(\epsilon^{-2.5})$. We compare the average reward performance of our proposed ARO-DDPG algorithm and observe better empirical performance compared to state-of-the-art on-policy average reward actor-critic algorithms over MuJoCo-based environments.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/saxena23a	Naman Saxena, Subhojyoti Khastagir, Shishir N Y, Shalabh Bhatnagar
Facial Expression Recognition with Adaptive Frame Rate based on Multiple Testing Correction	In this paper, we consider the problem of the high computational complexity of video-based facial expression recognition. A novel sequential procedure is proposed with an adaptive frame rate selection in a short video fragment to speed up decision-making. We automatically adjust the frame rate and process fewer frames with a low frame rate for more straightforward videos and more frames for complex ones. To determine the frame rate at which an inference is sufficiently reliable, the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure from multiple comparisons theory is employed to control the false discovery rate. The main advantages of our method are an improvement of the trustworthiness of decision-making by maintaining only one hyper-parameter (false acceptance rate) and its applicability with arbitrary neural network models used as facial feature extractors without the need to re-train these models. An experimental study on datasets from ABAW and EmotiW challenges proves the superior performance (1.5-40 times faster) of the proposed approach compared to processing all frames and existing techniques with early exiting and adaptive frame selection.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/savchenko23a	Andrey Savchenko
StyleGAN-T: Unlocking the Power of GANs for Fast Large-Scale Text-to-Image Synthesis	Text-to-image synthesis has recently seen significant progress thanks to large pretrained language models, large-scale training data, and the introduction of scalable model families such as diffusion and autoregressive models. However, the best-performing models require iterative evaluation to generate a single sample. In contrast, generative adversarial networks (GANs) only need a single forward pass. They are thus much faster, but they currently remain far behind the state-of-the-art in large-scale text-to-image synthesis. This paper aims to identify the necessary steps to regain competitiveness. Our proposed model, StyleGAN-T, addresses the specific requirements of large-scale text-to-image synthesis, such as large capacity, stable training on diverse datasets, strong text alignment, and controllable variation vs. text alignment tradeoff. StyleGAN-T significantly improves over previous GANs and outperforms distilled diffusion models - the previous state-of-the-art in fast text-to-image synthesis - in terms of sample quality and speed.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sauer23a	Axel Sauer, Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, Andreas Geiger, Timo Aila
Existence and Estimation of Critical Batch Size for Training Generative Adversarial Networks with Two Time-Scale Update Rule	Previous results have shown that a two time-scale update rule (TTUR) using different learning rates, such as different constant rates or different decaying rates, is useful for training generative adversarial networks (GANs) in theory and in practice. Moreover, not only the learning rate but also the batch size is important for training GANs with TTURs and they both affect the number of steps needed for training. This paper studies the relationship between batch size and the number of steps needed for training GANs with TTURs based on constant learning rates. We theoretically show that, for a TTUR with constant learning rates, the number of steps needed to find stationary points of the loss functions of both the discriminator and generator decreases as the batch size increases and that there exists a critical batch size minimizing the stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity. Then, we use the Fréchet inception distance (FID) as the performance measure for training and provide numerical results indicating that the number of steps needed to achieve a low FID score decreases as the batch size increases and that the SFO complexity increases once the batch size exceeds the measured critical batch size. Moreover, we show that measured critical batch sizes are close to the sizes estimated from our theoretical results.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sato23b	Naoki Sato, Hideaki Iiduka
Graph Neural Networks can Recover the Hidden Features Solely from the Graph Structure	Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are popular models for graph learning problems. GNNs show strong empirical performance in many practical tasks. However, the theoretical properties have not been completely elucidated. In this paper, we investigate whether GNNs can exploit the graph structure from the perspective of the expressive power of GNNs. In our analysis, we consider graph generation processes that are controlled by hidden (or latent) node features, which contain all information about the graph structure. A typical example of this framework is kNN graphs constructed from the hidden features. In our main results, we show that GNNs can recover the hidden node features from the input graph alone, even when all node features, including the hidden features themselves and any indirect hints, are unavailable. GNNs can further use the recovered node features for downstream tasks. These results show that GNNs can fully exploit the graph structure by themselves, and in effect, GNNs can use both the hidden and explicit node features for downstream tasks. In the experiments, we confirm the validity of our results by showing that GNNs can accurately recover the hidden features using a GNN architecture built based on our theoretical analysis.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sato23a	Ryoma Sato
Posterior Sampling for Deep Reinforcement Learning	Despite remarkable successes, deep reinforcement learning algorithms remain sample inefficient: they require an enormous amount of trial and error to find good policies. Model-based algorithms promise sample efficiency by building an environment model that can be used for planning. Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning is such a model-based algorithm that has attracted significant interest due to its performance in the tabular setting. This paper introduces Posterior Sampling for Deep Reinforcement Learning (PSDRL), the first truly scalable approximation of Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning that retains its model-based essence. PSDRL combines efficient uncertainty quantification over latent state space models with a specially tailored incremental planning algorithm based on value-function approximation. Extensive experiments on the Atari benchmark show that PSDRL significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art attempts at scaling up posterior sampling while being competitive with a state-of-the-art (model-based) reinforcement learning method, both in sample efficiency and computational efficiency.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sasso23a	Remo Sasso, Michelangelo Conserva, Paulo Rauber
Random Teachers are Good Teachers	In this work, we investigate the implicit regularization induced by teacher-student learning dynamics in self-distillation. To isolate its effect, we describe a simple experiment where we consider teachers at random initialization instead of trained teachers. Surprisingly, when distilling a student into such a random teacher, we observe that the resulting model and its representations already possess very interesting characteristics; (1) we observe a strong improvement of the distilled student over its teacher in terms of probing accuracy. (2) The learned representations are data-dependent and transferable between different tasks but deteriorate strongly if trained on random inputs. (3) The student checkpoint contains sparse subnetworks, so-called lottery tickets, and lies on the border of linear basins in the supervised loss landscape. These observations have interesting consequences for several important areas in machine learning: (1) Self-distillation can work solely based on the implicit regularization present in the gradient dynamics without relying on any dark knowledge, (2) self-supervised learning can learn features even in the absence of data augmentation and (3) training dynamics during the early phase of supervised training do not necessarily require label information. Finally, we shed light on an intriguing local property of the loss landscape: the process of feature learning is strongly amplified if the student is initialized closely to the teacher. These results raise interesting questions about the nature of the landscape that have remained unexplored so far.

Streaming Active Learning with Deep Neural Networks	Active learning is perhaps most naturally posed as an online learning problem. However, prior active learning approaches with deep neural networks assume offline access to the entire dataset ahead of time. This paper proposes VeSSAL, a new algorithm for batch active learning with deep neural networks in streaming settings, which samples groups of points to query for labels at the moment they are encountered. Our approach trades off between uncertainty and diversity of queried samples to match a desired query rate without requiring any hand-tuned hyperparameters. Altogether, we expand the applicability of deep neural networks to realistic active learning scenarios, such as applications relevant to HCI and large, fractured datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/saran23a	Akanksha Saran, Safoora Yousefi, Akshay Krishnamurthy, John Langford, Jordan T.

Whose Opinions Do Language Models Reflect?	Language models (LMs) are increasingly being used in open-ended contexts, where the opinions they reflect in response to subjective queries can have a profound impact, both on user satisfaction, and shaping the views of society at large. We put forth a quantitative framework to investigate the opinions reflected by LMs – by leveraging high-quality public opinion polls. Using this framework, we create OpinionQA, a dataset for evaluating the alignment of LM opinions with those of 60 US demographic groups over topics ranging from abortion to automation. Across topics, we find substantial misalignment between the views reflected by current LMs and those of US demographic groups: on par with the Democrat-Republican divide on climate change. Notably, this misalignment persists even after explicitly steering the LMs towards particular groups. Our analysis not only confirms prior observations about the left-leaning tendencies of some human feedback-tuned LMs, but also surfaces groups whose opinions are poorly reflected by current LMs (e.g., 65+ and widowed individuals).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/santurkar23a	Shibani Santurkar, Esin Durmus, Faisal Ladhak, Cinoo Lee, Percy Liang, Tatsunori Hashimoto
Discrete Continuous Optimization Framework for Simultaneous Clustering and Training in Mixture Models	We study a new framework of learning mixture models via automatic clustering called PRESTO, wherein we optimize a joint objective function on the model parameters and the partitioning, with each model tailored to perform well on its specific cluster. In contrast to prior work, we do not assume any generative model for the data. We convert our training problem to a joint parameter estimation cum a subset selection problem, subject to a matroid span constraint. This allows us to reduce our problem into a constrained set function minimization problem, where the underlying objective is monotone and approximately submodular. We then propose a new joint discrete-continuous optimization algorithm that achieves a bounded approximation guarantee for our problem. We show that PRESTO outperforms several alternative methods. Finally, we study PRESTO in the context of resource-efficient deep learning, where we train smaller resource-constrained models on each partition and show that it outperforms existing data partitioning and model pruning/knowledge distillation approaches, which in contrast to PRESTO, require large initial (teacher) models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sangani23a	Parth Vipul Sangani, Arjun Shashank Kashettiwar, Pritish Chakraborty, Bhuvan Reddy Gangula, Durga S, Ganesh Ramakrishnan, Rishabh K Iyer, Abir De
TAN Without a Burn: Scaling Laws of DP-SGD	Differentially Private methods for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have progressed recently, in particular with the use of massive batches and aggregated data augmentations for a large number of training steps. These techniques require much more computing resources than their non-private counterparts, shifting the traditional privacy-accuracy trade-off to a privacy-accuracy-compute trade-off and making hyper-parameter search virtually impossible for realistic scenarios. In this work, we decouple privacy analysis and experimental behavior of noisy training to explore the trade-off with minimal computational requirements. We first use the tools of Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP) to highlight that the privacy budget, when not overcharged, only depends on the total amount of noise (TAN) injected throughout training. We then derive scaling laws for training models with DP-SGD to optimize hyper-parameters with more than a $100\times$ reduction in computational budget. We apply the proposed method on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet and, in particular, strongly improve the state-of-the-art on ImageNet with a $+9$ points gain in top-1 accuracy for a privacy budget $\varepsilon=8$.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sander23b	Tom Sander, Pierre Stock, Alexandre Sablayrolles
Fast, Differentiable and Sparse Top-k: a Convex Analysis Perspective	The top-$k$ operator returns a $k$-sparse vector, where the non-zero values correspond to the $k$ largest values of the input. Unfortunately, because it is a discontinuous function, it is difficult to incorporate in neural networks trained end-to-end with backpropagation. Recent works have considered differentiable relaxations, based either on regularization or perturbation techniques. However, to date, no approach is fully differentiable and sparse. In this paper, we propose new differentiable and sparse top-$k$ operators. We view the top-$k$ operator as a linear program over the permutahedron, the convex hull of permutations. We then introduce a $p$-norm regularization term to smooth out the operator, and show that its computation can be reduced to isotonic optimization. Our framework is significantly more general than the existing one and allows for example to express top-$k$ operators that select values in magnitude. On the algorithmic side, in addition to pool adjacent violator (PAV) algorithms, we propose a new GPU/TPU-friendly Dykstra algorithm to solve isotonic optimization problems. We successfully use our operators to prune weights in neural networks, to fine-tune vision transformers, and as a router in sparse mixture of experts.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sander23a	Michael Eli Sander, Joan Puigcerver, Josip Djolonga, Gabriel Peyré, Mathieu Blondel
Raising the Cost of Malicious AI-Powered Image Editing	We present an approach to mitigating the risks of malicious image editing posed by large diffusion models. The key idea is to immunize images so as to make them resistant to manipulation by these models. This immunization relies on injection of imperceptible adversarial perturbations designed to disrupt the operation of the targeted diffusion models, forcing them to generate unrealistic images. We provide two methods for crafting such perturbations, and then demonstrate their efficacy. Finally, we discuss a policy component necessary to make our approach fully effective and practical—one that involves the organizations developing diffusion models, rather than individual users, to implement (and support) the immunization process.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/salman23a	Hadi Salman, Alaa Khaddaj, Guillaume Leclerc, Andrew Ilyas, Aleksander Madry
Optimizing Hyperparameters with Conformal Quantile Regression	Many state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization (HPO) algorithms rely on model-based optimizers that learn surrogate models of the target function to guide the search. Gaussian processes are the de facto surrogate model due to their ability to capture uncertainty. However, they make strong assumptions about the observation noise, which might not be warranted in practice. In this work, we propose to leverage conformalized quantile regression which makes minimal assumptions about the observation noise and, as a result, models the target function in a more realistic and robust fashion which translates to quicker HPO convergence on empirical benchmarks. To apply our method in a multi-fidelity setting, we propose a simple, yet effective, technique that aggregates observed results across different resource levels and outperforms conventional methods across many empirical tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/salinas23a	David Salinas, Jacek Golebiowski, Aaron Klein, Matthias Seeger, Cedric Archambeau
Distributed Linear Bandits under Communication Constraints	We consider distributed linear bandits where $M$ agents learn collaboratively to minimize the overall cumulative regret incurred by all agents. Information exchange is facilitated by a central server, and both the uplink and downlink communications are carried over channels with fixed capacity, which limits the amount of information that can be transmitted in each use of the channels. We investigate the regret-communication trade-off by (i) establishing information-theoretic lower bounds on the required communications (in terms of bits) for achieving a sublinear regret order; (ii) developing an efficient algorithm that achieves the minimum sublinear regret order offered by centralized learning using the minimum order of communications dictated by the information-theoretic lower bounds. For sparse linear bandits, we show a variant of the proposed algorithm offers better regret-communication trade-off by leveraging the sparsity of the problem.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/salgia23b	Sudeep Salgia, Qing Zhao
Provably and Practically Efficient Neural Contextual Bandits	We consider the neural contextual bandit problem. In contrast to the existing work which primarily focuses on ReLU neural nets, we consider a general set of smooth activation functions. Under this more general setting, (i) we derive non-asymptotic error bounds on the difference between an overparameterized neural net and its corresponding neural tangent kernel, (ii) we propose an algorithm with a provable sublinear regret bound that is also efficient in the finite regime as demonstrated by empirical studies. The non-asymptotic error bounds may be of broader interests as a tool to establish the relation between the smoothness of the activation functions in neural contextual bandits and the smoothness of the kernels in kernel bandits.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/salgia23a	Sudeep Salgia
PAC-Bayesian Offline Contextual Bandits With Guarantees	This paper introduces a new principled approach for off-policy learning in contextual bandits. Unlike previous work, our approach does not derive learning principles from intractable or loose bounds. We analyse the problem through the PAC-Bayesian lens, interpreting policies as mixtures of decision rules. This allows us to propose novel generalization bounds and provide tractable algorithms to optimize them. We prove that the derived bounds are tighter than their competitors, and can be optimized directly to confidently improve upon the logging policy offline. Our approach learns policies with guarantees, uses all available data and does not require tuning additional hyperparameters on held-out sets. We demonstrate through extensive experiments the effectiveness of our approach in providing performance guarantees in practical scenarios.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sakhi23a	Otmane Sakhi, Pierre Alquier, Nicolas Chopin
Rethinking Warm-Starts with Predictions: Learning Predictions Close to Sets of Optimal Solutions for Faster $\textL$-/$\textL^♮$-Convex Function Minimization	An emerging line of work has shown that machine-learned predictions are useful to warm-start algorithms for discrete optimization problems, such as bipartite matching. Previous studies have shown time complexity bounds proportional to some distance between a prediction and an optimal solution, which we can approximately minimize by learning predictions from past optimal solutions. However, such guarantees may not be meaningful when multiple optimal solutions exist. Indeed, the dual problem of bipartite matching and, more generally,	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sakaue23a	Shinsaku Sakaue, Taihei Oki
Off-Policy Evaluation for Large Action Spaces via Conjunct Effect Modeling	We study off-policy evaluation (OPE) of contextual bandit policies for large discrete action spaces where conventional importance-weighting approaches suffer from excessive variance.

Multi-class Graph Clustering via Approximated Effective $p$-Resistance	"This paper develops an approximation to the (effective) $p$-resistance and applies it to multi-class clustering. Spectral methods based on the graph Laplacian and its generalization to the graph $p$-Laplacian have been a backbone of non-euclidean clustering techniques. The advantage of the $p$-Laplacian is that the parameter $p$ induces a controllable bias on cluster structure. The drawback of $p$-Laplacian eigenvector based methods is that the third and higher eigenvectors are difficult to compute. Thus, instead, we are motivated to use the $p$-resistance induced by the $p$-Laplacian for clustering. For $p$-resistance, small $p$ biases towards clusters with high internal connectivity while large $p$ biases towards clusters of small ""extent,"" that is a preference for smaller shortest-path distances between vertices in the cluster. However, the $p$-resistance is expensive to compute. We overcome this by developing an approximation to the $p$-resistance. We prove upper and lower bounds on this approximation and observe that it is exact when the graph is a tree. We also provide theoretical justification for the use of $p$-resistance for clustering. Finally, we provide experiments comparing our approximated $p$-resistance clustering to other $p$-Laplacian based methods."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/saito23a	Shota Saito, Mark Herbster
Learning to Suggest Breaks: Sustainable Optimization of Long-Term User Engagement	Optimizing user engagement is a key goal for modern recommendation systems, but blindly pushing users towards increased consumption risks burn-out, churn, or even addictive habits. To promote digital well-being, most platforms now offer a service that periodically prompts users to take breaks. These, however, must be set up manually, and so may be suboptimal for both users and the system. In this paper, we study the role of breaks in recommendation, and propose a framework for learning optimal breaking policies that promote and sustain long-term engagement. Based on the notion that recommendation dynamics are susceptible to both positive and negative feedback, we cast recommendation as a Lotka-Volterra dynamical system, where breaking reduces to a problem of optimal control. We then give an efficient learning algorithm, provide theoretical guarantees, and empirically demonstrate the utility of our approach on semi-synthetic data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/saig23a	Eden Saig, Nir Rosenfeld
End-to-end Differentiable Clustering with Associative Memories	Clustering is a widely used unsupervised learning technique involving an intensive discrete optimization problem. Associative Memory models or AMs are differentiable neural networks defining a recursive dynamical system, which have been integrated with various deep learning architectures. We uncover a novel connection between the AM dynamics and the inherent discrete assignment necessary in clustering to propose a novel unconstrained continuous relaxation of the discrete clustering problem, enabling end-to-end differentiable clustering with AM, dubbed ClAM. Leveraging the pattern completion ability of AMs, we further develop a novel self-supervised clustering loss. Our evaluations on varied datasets demonstrate that ClAM benefits from the self-supervision, and significantly improves upon both the traditional Lloyd's k-means algorithm, and more recent continuous clustering relaxations (by upto 60% in terms of the Silhouette Coefficient).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/saha23a	Bishwajit Saha, Dmitry Krotov, Mohammed J Zaki, Parikshit Ram
High-Probability Bounds for Stochastic Optimization and Variational Inequalities: the Case of Unbounded Variance	During the recent years the interest of optimization and machine learning communities in high-probability convergence of stochastic optimization methods has been growing. One of the main reasons for this is that high-probability complexity bounds are more accurate and less studied than in-expectation ones. However, SOTA high-probability non-asymptotic convergence results are derived under strong assumptions such as boundedness of the gradient noise variance or of the objective's gradient itself. In this paper, we propose several algorithms with high-probability convergence results under less restrictive assumptions. In particular, we derive new high-probability convergence results under the assumption that the gradient/operator noise has bounded central $\alpha$-th moment for $\alpha \in (1,2]$ in the following setups: (i) smooth non-convex / Polyak-Lojasiewicz / convex / strongly convex / quasi-strongly convex minimization problems, (ii) Lipschitz / star-cocoercive and monotone / quasi-strongly monotone variational inequalities. These results justify the usage of the considered methods for solving problems that do not fit standard functional classes studied in stochastic optimization.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sadiev23a	Abdurakhmon Sadiev, Marina Danilova, Eduard Gorbunov, Samuel Horváth, Gauthier Gidel, Pavel Dvurechensky, Alexander Gasnikov, Peter Richtárik
Global Selection of Contrastive Batches via Optimization on Sample Permutations	Contrastive Learning has recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of unimodal and multimodal tasks. Many contrastive learning approaches use mined hard negatives to make batches more informative during training but these approaches are inefficient as they increase epoch length proportional to the number of mined negatives and require frequent updates of nearest neighbor indices or mining from recent batches. In this work, we provide an alternative to hard negative mining, Global Contrastive Batch Sampling (GCBS), an efficient approximation to the batch assignment problem that upper bounds the gap between the global and training losses, $\mathcal{L}^{Global} - \mathcal{L}^{Train}$, in contrastive learning settings. Through experimentation we find GCBS improves state-of-the-art performance in sentence embedding and code-search tasks. Additionally, GCBS is easy to implement as it requires only a few additional lines of code, does not maintain external data structures such as nearest neighbor indices, is more computationally efficient than the most minimal hard negative mining approaches, and makes no changes to the model being trained. Code is available at https://github.com/vinayak1/GCBS.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/sachidananda23a	Vin Sachidananda, Ziyi Yang, Chenguang Zhu
Sample Complexity Bounds for Learning High-dimensional Simplices in Noisy Regimes	In this paper, we propose sample complexity bounds for learning a simplex from noisy samples. A dataset of size $n$ is given which includes i.i.d. samples drawn from a uniform distribution over an unknown arbitrary simplex in $\mathbb{R}^K$, where samples are assumed to be corrupted by a multi-variate additive Gaussian noise of an arbitrary magnitude. We prove the existence of an algorithm that with high probability outputs a simplex having a $\ell_2$ distance of at most $\varepsilon$ from the true simplex (for any $\varepsilon>0$). Also, we theoretically show that in order to achieve this bound, it is sufficient to have $n\ge\tilde{\Omega}\left(K^2/\varepsilon^2\right)e^{\Omega\left(K/\mathrm{SNR}^2\right)}$ samples, where $\mathrm{SNR}$ stands for the signal-to-noise ratio and is defined as the ratio of the maximum component-wise standard deviation of the simplex (signal) to that of the noise vector. This result solves an important open problem in this area of research, and shows as long as $\mathrm{SNR}\ge\Omega\left(\sqrt{K}\right)$ the sample complexity of the noisy regime has the same order to that of the noiseless case. Our proofs are a combination of the so-called sample compression technique in (Ashtiani et al., 2018), mathematical tools from high-dimensional geometry, and Fourier analysis. In particular, we have proposed a general Fourier-based technique for recovery of a more general class of distribution families from additive Gaussian noise, which can be further used in a variety of other related problems.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/saberi23a	Seyed Amir Hossein Saberi, Amir Najafi, Abolfazl Motahari, Babak Khalaj
Active Ranking of Experts Based on their Performances in Many Tasks	We consider the problem of ranking n experts based on their performances on d tasks. We make a monotonicity assumption stating that for each pair of experts, one outperforms the other on all tasks. We consider the sequential setting where in each round the learner has access to noisy evaluations of actively chosen pair of expert-task, given the information available up to the actual round. Given a confidence parameter $\delta \in (0, 1)$, we provide strategies allowing to recover the correct ranking of experts and develop a bound on the total number of queries made by our algorithm that hold with probability at least $1-\delta$. We show that our strategy is adaptive to the complexity of the problem (our bounds are instance dependent), and develop matching lower bounds up to a ploy-logarithmic factor. Finally, we adapt our strategy to the relaxed problem of best expert identification and provide numerical simulation consistent with our theoretical results	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/saad23b	El Mehdi Saad, Nicolas Verzelen, Alexandra Carpentier
Sequential Monte Carlo Learning for Time Series Structure Discovery	"This paper presents a new approach to automatically discovering accurate models of complex time series data. Working within a Bayesian nonparametric prior over a symbolic space of Gaussian process time series models, we present a novel structure learning algorithm that integrates sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and involutive MCMC for highly effective posterior inference. Our method can be used both in ""online"" settings, where new data is incorporated sequentially in time, and in ""offline"" settings, by using nested subsets of historical data to anneal the posterior. Empirical measurements on real-world time series show that our method can deliver 10x–100x runtime speedups over previous MCMC and greedy-search structure learning algorithms targeting the same model family. We use our method to perform the first large-scale evaluation of Gaussian process time series structure learning on a prominent benchmark of 1,428 econometric datasets. The results show that our method discovers sensible models that deliver more accurate point forecasts and interval forecasts over multiple horizons as compared to widely used statistical and neural baselines that struggle on this challenging data."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/saad23a	Feras Saad, Brian Patton, Matthew Douglas Hoffman, Rif A.

End-to-End Learning for Stochastic Optimization: A Bayesian Perspective	We develop a principled approach to end-to-end learning in stochastic optimization. First, we show that the standard end-to-end learning algorithm admits a Bayesian interpretation and trains a posterior Bayes action map. Building on the insights of this analysis, we then propose new end-to-end learning algorithms for training decision maps that output solutions of empirical risk minimization and distributionally robust optimization problems, two dominant modeling paradigms in optimization under uncertainty. Numerical results for a synthetic newsvendor problem illustrate the key differences between alternative training schemes. We also investigate an economic dispatch problem based on real data to showcase the impact of the neural network architecture of the decision maps on their test performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/rychener23a	Yves Rychener, Daniel Kuhn, Tobias Sutter
Hiera: A Hierarchical Vision Transformer without the Bells-and-Whistles	Modern hierarchical vision transformers have added several vision-specific components in the pursuit of supervised classification performance. While these components lead to effective accuracies and attractive FLOP counts, the added complexity actually makes these transformers slower than their vanilla ViT counterparts. In this paper, we argue that this additional bulk is unnecessary. By pretraining with a strong visual pretext task (MAE), we can strip out all the bells-and-whistles from a state-of-the-art multi-stage vision transformer without losing accuracy. In the process, we create Hiera, an extremely simple hierarchical vision transformer that is more accurate than previous models while being significantly faster both at inference and during training. We evaluate Hiera on a variety of tasks for image and video recognition.

SWARM Parallelism: Training Large Models Can Be Surprisingly Communication-Efficient	"Many deep learning applications benefit from using large models with billions of parameters. Training these models is notoriously expensive due to the need for specialized HPC clusters. In this work, we consider alternative setups for training large models: using cheap ""preemptible"" instances or pooling existing resources from multiple regions. We analyze the performance of existing model-parallel algorithms in these conditions and find configurations where training larger models becomes less communication-intensive. Based on these findings, we propose SWARM Parallelism (Stochastically Wired Adaptively Rebalanced Model Parallelism), a model-parallel training algorithm designed for poorly connected, heterogeneous and unreliable devices. SWARM creates temporary randomized pipelines between nodes that are rebalanced in case of failure. We empirically validate our findings and compare SWARM Parallelism with existing large-scale training approaches. Finally, we combine our insights with compression strategies to train a large Transformer language model with 1B shared parameters ($\approx$13B before sharing) on preemptible T4 GPUs with less than 200 Mb/s network."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ryabinin23a	Max Ryabinin, Tim Dettmers, Michael Diskin, Alexander Borzunov
Intrinsic Sliced Wasserstein Distances for Comparing Collections of Probability Distributions on Manifolds and Graphs	Collections of probability distributions arise in a variety of applications ranging from user activity pattern analysis to brain connectomics. In practice these distributions can be defined over diverse domain types including finite intervals, circles, cylinders, spheres, other manifolds, and graphs. This paper introduces an approach for detecting differences between two collections of distributions over such general domains. To this end, we propose the intrinsic slicing construction that yields a novel class of Wasserstein distances on manifolds and graphs. These distances are Hilbert embeddable, allowing us to reduce the distribution collection comparison problem to a more familiar mean testing problem in a Hilbert space. We provide two testing procedures one based on resampling and another on combining p-values from coordinate-wise tests. Our experiments in various synthetic and real data settings show that the resulting tests are powerful and the p-values are well-calibrated.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/rustamov23a	Raif M.

Differential Privacy, Linguistic Fairness, and Training Data Influence: Impossibility and Possibility Theorems for Multilingual Language Models	Language models such as mBERT, XLM-R, and BLOOM aim to achieve multilingual generalization or compression to facilitate transfer to a large number of (potentially unseen) languages. However, these models should ideally also be private, linguistically fair, and transparent, by relating their predictions to training data. Can these requirements be simultaneously satisfied? We show that multilingual compression and linguistic fairness are compatible with differential privacy, but that differential privacy is at odds with training data influence sparsity, an objective for transparency. We further present a series of experiments on two common NLP tasks and evaluate multilingual compression and training data influence sparsity under different privacy guarantees, exploring these trade-offs in more detail. Our results suggest that we need to develop ways to jointly optimize for these objectives in order to find practical trade-offs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/rust23a	Phillip Rust, Anders Søgaard
Constrained Monotonic Neural Networks	Wider adoption of neural networks in many critical domains such as finance and healthcare is being hindered by the need to explain their predictions and to impose additional constraints on them. Monotonicity constraint is one of the most requested properties in real-world scenarios and is the focus of this paper. One of the oldest ways to construct a monotonic fully connected neural network is to constrain signs on its weights. Unfortunately, this construction does not work with popular non-saturated activation functions as it can only approximate convex functions. We show this shortcoming can be fixed by constructing two additional activation functions from a typical unsaturated monotonic activation function and employing each of them on the part of neurons. Our experiments show this approach of building monotonic neural networks has better accuracy when compared to other state-of-the-art methods, while being the simplest one in the sense of having the least number of parameters, and not requiring any modifications to the learning procedure or post-learning steps. Finally, we prove it can approximate any continuous monotone function on a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/runje23a	Davor Runje, Sharath M Shankaranarayana
Geometric Clifford Algebra Networks	We propose Geometric Clifford Algebra Networks (GCANs) for modeling dynamical systems. GCANs are based on symmetry group transformations using geometric (Clifford) algebras. We first review the quintessence of modern (plane-based) geometric algebra, which builds on isometries encoded as elements of the $\mathrm{Pin}(p,q,r)$ group. We then propose the concept of group action layers, which linearly combine object transformations using pre-specified group actions. Together with a new activation and normalization scheme, these layers serve as adjustable geometric templates that can be refined via gradient descent. Theoretical advantages are strongly reflected in the modeling of three-dimensional rigid body transformations as well as large-scale fluid dynamics simulations, showing significantly improved performance over traditional methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ruhe23a	David Ruhe, Jayesh K Gupta, Steven De Keninck, Max Welling, Johannes Brandstetter
A New PHO-rmula for Improved Performance of Semi-Structured Networks	Recent advances to combine structured regression models and deep neural networks for better interpretability, more expressiveness, and statistically valid uncertainty quantification demonstrate the versatility of semi-structured neural networks (SSNs). We show that techniques to properly identify the contributions of the different model components in SSNs, however, lead to suboptimal network estimation, slower convergence, and degenerated or erroneous predictions. In order to solve these problems while preserving favorable model properties, we propose a non-invasive post-hoc orthogonalization (PHO) that guarantees identifiability of model components and provides better estimation and prediction quality. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical experiments, a benchmark comparison as well as a real-world application to COVID-19 infections.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/rugamer23a	David Rügamer
Function-Space Regularization in Neural Networks: A Probabilistic Perspective	Parameter-space regularization in neural network optimization is a fundamental tool for improving generalization. However, standard parameter-space regularization methods make it challenging to encode explicit preferences about desired predictive functions into neural network training. In this work, we approach regularization in neural networks from a probabilistic perspective and show that by viewing parameter-space regularization as specifying an empirical prior distribution over the model parameters, we can derive a probabilistically well-motivated regularization technique that allows explicitly encoding information about desired predictive functions into neural network training. This method—which we refer to as function-space empirical Bayes (FS-EB)—includes both parameter- and function-space regularization, is mathematically simple, easy to implement, and incurs only minimal computational overhead compared to standard regularization techniques. We evaluate the utility of this regularization technique empirically and demonstrate that the proposed method leads to near-perfect semantic shift detection, highly-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates, successful task adaption from pre-trained models, and improved generalization under covariate shift.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/rudner23a	Tim G.

Infinite Action Contextual Bandits with Reusable Data Exhaust	For infinite action contextual bandits, smoothed regret and reduction to regression results in state-of-the-art online performance with computational cost independent of the action set: unfortunately, the resulting data exhaust does not have well-defined importance-weights. This frustrates the execution of downstream data science processes such as offline model selection. In this paper we describe an online algorithm with an equivalent smoothed regret guarantee, but which generates well-defined importance weights: in exchange, the online computational cost increases, but only to order smoothness (i.e., still independent of the action set). This removes a key obstacle to adoption of smoothed regret in production scenarios.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/rucker23a	Mark Rucker, Yinglun Zhu, Paul Mineiro
Robust Satisficing MDPs	Despite being a fundamental building block for reinforcement learning, Markov decision processes (MDPs) often suffer from ambiguity in model parameters. Robust MDPs are proposed to overcome this challenge by optimizing the worst-case performance under ambiguity. While robust MDPs can provide reliable policies with limited data, their worst-case performances are often overly conservative, and so they do not offer practical insights into the actual performance of these reliable policies. This paper proposes robust satisficing MDPs (RSMDPs), where the expected returns of feasible policies are softly-constrained to achieve a user-specified target under ambiguity. We derive a tractable reformulation for RSMDPs and develop a first-order method for solving large instances. Experimental results demonstrate that RSMDPs can prescribe policies to achieve their targets, which are much higher than the optimal worst-case returns computed by robust MDPs. Moreover, the average and percentile performances of our model are competitive among other models. We also demonstrate the scalability of the proposed algorithm compared with a state-of-the-art commercial solver.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ruan23a	Haolin Ruan, Siyu Zhou, Zhi Chen, Chin Pang Ho
The Statistical Benefits of Quantile Temporal-Difference Learning for Value Estimation	We study the problem of temporal-difference-based policy evaluation in reinforcement learning. In particular, we analyse the use of a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm, quantile temporal-difference learning (QTD), for this task. We reach the surprising conclusion that even if a practitioner has no interest in the return distribution beyond the mean, QTD (which learns predictions about the full distribution of returns) may offer performance superior to approaches such as classical TD learning, which predict only the mean return, even in the tabular setting.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/rowland23a	Mark Rowland, Yunhao Tang, Clare Lyle, Remi Munos, Marc G Bellemare, Will Dabney
Improving Fair Training under Correlation Shifts	Model fairness is an essential element for Trustworthy AI. While many techniques for model fairness have been proposed, most of them assume that the training and deployment data distributions are identical, which is often not true in practice. In particular, when the bias between labels and sensitive groups changes, the fairness of the trained model is directly influenced and can worsen. We make two contributions for solving this problem. First, we analytically show that existing in-processing fair algorithms have fundamental limits in accuracy and group fairness. We utilize the notion of correlation shifts between labels and groups, which can explicitly capture the change of the above bias. Second, we propose a novel pre-processing step that samples the input data to reduce correlation shifts and thus enables the in-processing approaches to overcome their limitations. We formulate an optimization problem for adjusting the data ratio among labels and sensitive groups to reflect the shifted correlation. A key benefit of our approach lies in decoupling the roles of pre- and in-processing approaches: correlation adjustment via pre-processing and unfairness mitigation on the processed data via in-processing. Experiments show that our framework effectively improves existing in-processing fair algorithms w.r.t. accuracy and fairness, both on synthetic and real datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/roh23a	Yuji Roh, Kangwook Lee, Steven Euijong Whang, Changho Suh
RLang: A Declarative Language for Describing Partial World Knowledge to Reinforcement Learning Agents	We introduce RLang, a domain-specific language (DSL) for communicating domain knowledge to an RL agent. Unlike existing RL DSLs that ground to $\textit{single}$ elements of a decision-making formalism (e.g., the reward function or policy), RLang can specify information about every element of a Markov decision process. We define precise syntax and grounding semantics for RLang, and provide a parser that grounds RLang programs to an algorithm-agnostic $\textit{partial}$ world model and policy that can be exploited by an RL agent. We provide a series of example RLang programs demonstrating how different RL methods can exploit the resulting knowledge, encompassing model-free and model-based tabular algorithms, policy gradient and value-based methods, hierarchical approaches, and deep methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/rodriguez-sanchez23a	Rafael Rodriguez-Sanchez, Benjamin Adin Spiegel, Jennifer Wang, Roma Patel, Stefanie Tellex, George Konidaris
The Role of Entropy and Reconstruction in Multi-View Self-Supervised Learning	The mechanisms behind the success of multi-view self-supervised learning (MVSSL) are not yet fully understood. Contrastive MVSSL methods have been studied through the lens of InfoNCE, a lower bound of the Mutual Information (MI). However, the relation between other MVSSL methods and MI remains unclear. We consider a different lower bound on the MI consisting of an entropy and a reconstruction term (ER), and analyze the main MVSSL families through its lens. Through this ER bound, we show that clustering-based methods such as DeepCluster and SwAV maximize the MI. We also re-interpret the mechanisms of distillation-based approaches such as BYOL and DINO, showing that they explicitly maximize the reconstruction term and implicitly encourage a stable entropy, and we confirm this empirically. We show that replacing the objectives of common MVSSL methods with this ER bound achieves competitive performance, while making them stable when training with smaller batch sizes or smaller exponential moving average (EMA) coefficients.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/rodri-guez-galvez23a	Borja Rodrı́guez Gálvez, Arno Blaas, Pau Rodriguez, Adam Golinski, Xavier Suau, Jason Ramapuram, Dan Busbridge, Luca Zappella
Lowering the Pre-training Tax for Gradient-based Subset Training: A Lightweight Distributed Pre-Training Toolkit	"Training data and model sizes are increasing exponentially. One way to reduce training time and resources is to train with a carefully selected subset of the full dataset. Prior work uses the gradient signals obtained during a warm-up or ""pre-training"" phase over the full dataset, for determining the core subset; if the pre-training phase is too small, the gradients obtained are chaotic and unreliable. As a result, the pre-training phase itself incurs significant time/resource overhead, and prior work has not gone beyond hyperparameter search to reduce pre-training time. Our work explicitly aims to reduce this $\textbf{pre-training tax}$ in gradient-based subset training. We develop a principled, scalable approach for pre-training in a distributed setup. Our approach is $\textit{lightweight}$ and $\textit{minimizes communication}$ between distributed worker nodes. It is the first to utilize the concept of model-soup based distributed training $\textit{at initialization}$. The key idea is to minimally train an ensemble of models on small, disjointed subsets of the data; we further employ data-driven sparsity and data augmentation for local worker training to boost ensemble diversity. The centralized model, obtained at the end of pre-training by merging the per-worker models, is found to offer stabilized gradient signals to select subsets, on which the main model is further trained. We have validated the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet, using ResNet and WideResNet models. For example, our approach is shown to achieve $\textbf{15.4$\times$}$ pre-training speedup and $\textbf{2.8$\times$}$ end-to-end speedup on CIFAR10 and ResNet18 without loss of accuracy. The code is at https://github.com/moonbucks/LiPT.git."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ro23a	Yeonju Ro, Zhangyang Wang, Vijay Chidambaram, Aditya Akella
A Two-Stage Active Learning Algorithm for k-Nearest Neighbors	$k$-nearest neighbor classification is a popular non-parametric method because of desirable properties like automatic adaption to distributional scale changes. Unfortunately, it has thus far proved difficult to design active learning strategies for the training of local voting-based classifiers that naturally retain these desirable properties, and hence active learning strategies for $k$-nearest neighbor classification have been conspicuously missing from the literature. In this work, we introduce a simple and intuitive active learning algorithm for the training of $k$-nearest neighbor classifiers, the first in the literature which retains the concept of the $k$-nearest neighbor vote at prediction time. We provide consistency guarantees for a modified $k$-nearest neighbors classifier trained on samples acquired via our scheme, and show that when the conditional probability function $\mathbb{P}(Y=y|X=x)$ is sufficiently smooth and the Tsybakov noise condition holds, our actively trained classifiers converge to the Bayes optimal classifier at a faster asymptotic rate than passively trained $k$-nearest neighbor classifiers.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/rittler23a	Nicholas Rittler, Kamalika Chaudhuri
Multi-Agent Best Arm Identification with Private Communications	We address multi-agent best arm identification with privacy guarantees. In this setting, agents collaborate by communicating to find the optimal arm. To avoid leaking sensitive data through messages, we consider two notions of privacy withholding different kinds of information: differential privacy and $(\epsilon, \eta)$-privacy. For each privacy definition, we propose an algorithm based on a two-level successive elimination scheme. We provide theoretical guarantees for the privacy level, accuracy and sample complexity of our algorithms. Experiments on various settings support our theoretical findings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/rio23a	Alexandre Rio, Merwan Barlier, Igor Colin, Marta Soare
The Edge of Orthogonality: A Simple View of What Makes BYOL Tick	Self-predictive unsupervised learning methods such as BYOL or SimSIAM have shown impressive results, and counter-intuitively, do not collapse to trivial representations. In this work, we aim at exploring the simplest possible mathematical arguments towards explaining the underlying mechanisms behind self-predictive unsupervised learning. We start with the observation that those methods crucially rely on the presence of a predictor network (and stop-gradient). With simple linear algebra, we show that when using a linear predictor, the optimal predictor is close to an orthogonal projection, and propose a general framework based on orthonormalization that enables to interpret and give intuition on why BYOL works. In addition, this framework demonstrates the crucial role of the exponential moving average and stop-gradient operator in BYOL as an efficient orthonormalization mechanism. We use these insights to propose four new closed-form predictor variants of BYOL to support our analysis. Our closed-form predictors outperform standard linear trainable predictor BYOL at 100 and 300 epochs (top-1 linear accuracy on ImageNet).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/richemond23a	Pierre Harvey Richemond, Allison Tam, Yunhao Tang, Florian Strub, Bilal Piot, Felix Hill
Learning Control-Oriented Dynamical Structure from Data	Even for known nonlinear dynamical systems, feedback controller synthesis is a difficult problem that often requires leveraging the particular structure of the dynamics to induce a stable closed-loop system. For general nonlinear models, including those fit to data, there may not be enough known structure to reliably synthesize a stabilizing feedback controller. In this paper, we discuss a state-dependent nonlinear tracking controller formulation based on a state-dependent Riccati equation for general nonlinear control-affine systems. This formulation depends on a nonlinear factorization of the system of vector fields defining the control-affine dynamics, which always exists under mild smoothness assumptions. We propose a method for learning this factorization from a finite set of data. On a variety of simulated nonlinear dynamical systems, we empirically demonstrate the efficacy of learned versions of this controller in stable trajectory tracking. Alongside our learning method, we evaluate recent ideas in jointly learning a controller and stabilizability certificate for known dynamical systems; we show experimentally that such methods can be frail in comparison.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/richards23a	Spencer M.

Feature Programming for Multivariate Time Series Prediction	We introduce the concept of programmable feature engineering for time series modeling and propose a feature programming framework. This framework generates large amounts of predictive features for noisy multivariate time series while allowing users to incorporate their inductive bias with minimal effort. The key motivation of our framework is to view any multivariate time series as a cumulative sum of fine-grained trajectory increments, with each increment governed by a novel spin-gas dynamical Ising model. This fine-grained perspective motivates the development of a parsimonious set of operators that summarize multivariate time series in an abstract fashion, serving as the foundation for large-scale automated feature engineering. Numerically, we validate the efficacy of our method on several synthetic and real-world noisy time series datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/reneau23a	Alex Daniel Reneau, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Ammar Gilani, Han Liu
Dimension-independent Certified Neural Network Watermarks via Mollifier Smoothing	Certified_Watermarks is the first to provide a watermark certificate against $l_2$-norm watermark removal attacks, by leveraging the randomized smoothing techniques for certified robustness to adversarial attacks. However, the randomized smoothing techniques suffer from hardness of certified robustness in high-dimensional space against $l_p$-norm attacks for large $p$ ($p>2$). The certified watermark method based on the randomized smoothing is no exception, i.e., fails to provide meaningful certificates in high-dimensional space against the $l_p$-norm watermark removal attacks ($p>2$). By leveraging mollifier theory, this paper proposes a mollifier smoothing method with dimension-independent certified radius of our proposed smooth classifier, for conducting the certified watermark problem against the $l_p$-norm watermark removal attacks ($1 \leq p \leq \infty$) for high parameter dimension $d$. Based on partial differential equation (PDE) theory, an approximation of mollifier smoothing is developed to alleviate the inefficiency of sampling and prediction in the randomized smoothing as well as numerical integration in the mollifier smoothing, while maintaining the certified watermark against the $l_p$-norm watermark removal attacks ($1 \leq p \leq \infty$).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ren23c	Jiaxiang Ren, Yang Zhou, Jiayin Jin, Lingjuan Lyu, Da Yan
Escaping saddle points in zeroth-order optimization: the power of two-point estimators	Two-point zeroth order methods are important in many applications of zeroth-order optimization arising in robotics, wind farms, power systems, online optimization, and adversarial robustness to black-box attacks in deep neural networks, where the problem can be high-dimensional and/or time-varying. Furthermore, such problems may be nonconvex and contain saddle points. While existing works have shown that zeroth-order methods utilizing $\Omega(d)$ function valuations per iteration (with $d$ denoting the problem dimension) can escape saddle points efficiently, it remains an open question if zeroth-order methods based on two-point estimators can escape saddle points. In this paper, we show that by adding an appropriate isotropic perturbation at each iteration, a zeroth-order algorithm based on $2m$ (for any $1 \leq m \leq d$) function evaluations per iteration can not only find $\epsilon$-second order stationary points polynomially fast, but do so using only $\tilde{O}(\frac{d}{m\epsilon^{2}\bar{\psi}})$ function evaluations, where $\bar{\psi} \geq \tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{\epsilon})$ is a parameter capturing the extent to which the function of interest exhibits the strict saddle property.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ren23b	Zhaolin Ren, Yujie Tang, Na Li
Bayesian Neural Networks Avoid Encoding Complex and Perturbation-Sensitive Concepts	In this paper, we focus on mean-field variational Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) and explore the representation capacity of such BNNs by investigating which types of concepts are less likely to be encoded by the BNN. It has been observed and studied that a relatively small set of interactive concepts usually emerge in the knowledge representation of a sufficiently-trained neural network, and such concepts can faithfully explain the network output. Based on this, our study proves that compared to standard deep neural networks (DNNs), it is less likely for BNNs to encode complex concepts. Experiments verify our theoretical proofs. Note that the tendency to encode less complex concepts does not necessarily imply weak representation power, considering that complex concepts exhibit low generalization power and high adversarial vulnerability. The code is available at https://github.com/sjtu-xai-lab/BNN-concepts.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ren23a	Qihan Ren, Huiqi Deng, Yunuo Chen, Siyu Lou, Quanshi Zhang
Simplex Random Features	We present Simplex Random Features (SimRFs), a new random feature (RF) mechanism for unbiased approximation of the softmax and Gaussian kernels by geometrical correlation of random projection vectors. We prove that SimRFs provide the smallest possible mean square error (MSE) on unbiased estimates of these kernels among the class of weight-independent geometrically-coupled positive random feature (PRF) mechanisms, substantially outperforming the previously most accurate Orthogonal Random Features (ORFs) at no observable extra cost. We present a more computationally expensive SimRFs+ variant, which we prove is asymptotically optimal in the broader family of weight-dependent geometrical coupling schemes (which permit correlations between random vector directions and norms). In extensive empirical studies, we show consistent gains provided by SimRFs in settings including pointwise kernel estimation, nonparametric classification and scalable Transformers.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/reid23a	Isaac Reid, Krzysztof Marcin Choromanski, Valerii Likhosherstov, Adrian Weller
Neural networks trained with SGD learn distributions of increasing complexity	"The uncanny ability of over-parameterised neural networks to generalise well has been explained using various ""simplicity biases"". These theories postulate that neural networks avoid overfitting by first fitting simple, linear classifiers before learning more complex, non-linear functions. Meanwhile, data structure is also recognised as a key ingredient for good generalisation, yet its role in simplicity biases is not yet understood. Here, we show that neural networks trained using stochastic gradient descent initially classify their inputs using lower-order input statistics, like mean and covariance, and exploit higher-order statistics only later during training. We first demonstrate this"	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/refinetti23a	Maria Refinetti, Alessandro Ingrosso, Sebastian Goldt
Automated Search for Conjectures on Mathematical Constants using Analysis of Integer Sequences	The discovery of formulas involving mathematical constants such as $\pi$ and $e$ had a great impact on various fields of science and mathematics. However, such discoveries have remained scarce, relying on the intuition of mathematicians such as Ramanujan and Gauss. Recent efforts to automate such discoveries, such as the Ramanujan Machine project, relied solely on exhaustive search and remain limited by the space of options that can be covered. Here we propose a fundamentally different method to search for conjectures on mathematical constants: through analysis of integer sequences. We introduce the Enumerated Signed-continued-fraction Massey Approve (ESMA) algorithm, which builds on the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm to identify patterns in integer sequences that represent mathematical constants. ESMA has found various known formulas and new conjectures for $e, e^2, \tan(1)$, and ratios of values of Bessel functions, many of which provide faster numerical convergence than their corresponding simple continued fractions forms. We also characterize the space of constants that ESMA can catch and quantify its algorithmic advantage in certain scenarios. Altogether, this work continues the development toward algorithm-augmented mathematical intuition, to help accelerate mathematical research.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/razon23a	Ofir Razon, Yoav Harris, Shahar Gottlieb, Dan Carmon, Ofir David, Ido Kaminer
Monotonic Location Attention for Length Generalization	We explore different ways to utilize position-based cross-attention in seq2seq networks to enable length generalization in algorithmic tasks. We show that a simple approach of interpolating the original and reversed encoded representations combined with relative attention allows near-perfect length generalization for both forward and reverse lookup tasks or copy tasks that had been generally hard to tackle. We also devise harder diagnostic tasks where the relative distance of the ideal attention position varies with timestep. In such settings, the simple interpolation trick with relative attention is not sufficient. We introduce novel variants of location attention building on top of Dubois et al. (2020) to address the new diagnostic tasks. We also show the benefits of our approaches for length generalization in SCAN (Lake & Baroni, 2018) and CFQ (Keysers et al.,2020).

Beam Tree Recursive Cells	We propose Beam Tree Recursive Cell (BT-Cell) - a backpropagation-friendly framework to extend Recursive Neural Networks (RvNNs) with beam search for latent structure induction. We further extend this framework by proposing a relaxation of the hard top-$k$ operators in beam search for better propagation of gradient signals. We evaluate our proposed models in different out-of-distribution splits in both synthetic and realistic data. Our experiments show that BT-Cell achieves near-perfect performance on several challenging structure-sensitive synthetic tasks like ListOps and logical inference while maintaining comparable performance in realistic data against other RvNN-based models. Additionally, we identify a previously unknown failure case for neural models in generalization to unseen number of arguments in ListOps.

The Unintended Consequences of Discount Regularization: Improving Regularization in Certainty Equivalence Reinforcement Learning	Discount regularization, using a shorter planning horizon when calculating the optimal policy, is a popular choice to restrict planning to a less complex set of policies when estimating an MDP from sparse or noisy data (Jiang et al., 2015). It is commonly understood that discount regularization functions by de-emphasizing or ignoring delayed effects. In this paper, we reveal an alternate view of discount regularization that exposes unintended consequences. We demonstrate that planning under a lower discount factor produces an identical optimal policy to planning using any prior on the transition matrix that has the same distribution for all states and actions. In fact, it functions like a prior with stronger regularization on state-action pairs with more transition data. This leads to poor performance when the transition matrix is estimated from data sets with uneven amounts of data across state-action pairs. Our equivalence theorem leads to an explicit formula to set regularization parameters locally for individual state-action pairs rather than globally. We demonstrate the failures of discount regularization and how we remedy them using our state-action-specific method across simple empirical examples as well as a medical cancer simulator.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/rathnam23a	Sarah Rathnam, Sonali Parbhoo, Weiwei Pan, Susan Murphy, Finale Doshi-Velez
Feature learning in deep classifiers through Intermediate Neural Collapse	In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of the feature learning process in deep classifiers. Recent research has identified a training phenomenon called Neural Collapse (NC), in which the top-layer feature embeddings of samples from the same class tend to concentrate around their means, and the top layer's weights align with those features. Our study aims to investigate if these properties extend to intermediate layers. We empirically study the evolution of the covariance and mean of representations across different layers and show that as we move deeper into a trained neural network, the within-class covariance decreases relative to the between-class covariance. Additionally, we find that in the top layers, where the between-class covariance is dominant, the subspace spanned by the class means aligns with the subspace spanned by the most significant singular vector components of the weight matrix in the corresponding layer. Finally, we discuss the relationship between NC and Associative Memories (Willshaw et. al. 1969).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/rangamani23a	Akshay Rangamani, Marius Lindegaard, Tomer Galanti, Tomaso A Poggio
SpENCNN: Orchestrating Encoding and Sparsity for Fast Homomorphically Encrypted Neural Network Inference	Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is a promising technology to protect clients' data privacy for Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) on public clouds. However, HE operations can be orders of magnitude slower than their counterparts for plaintexts and thus result in prohibitively high inference latency, seriously hindering the practicality of HE. In this paper, we propose a HE-based fast neural network (NN) inference framework–SpENCNN built upon the co-design of HE operation-aware model sparsity and the single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD)-friendly data packing, to improve NN inference latency. In particular, we first develop an encryption-aware HE-group convolution technique that can partition channels among different groups based on the data size and ciphertext size, and then encode them into the same ciphertext by novel group-interleaved encoding, so as to dramatically reduce the number of bottlenecked operations in HE convolution. We further tailor a HE-friendly sub-block weight pruning to reduce the costly HE-based convolution operation. Our experiments show that SpENCNN can achieve overall speedups of 8.37$\times$, 12.11$\times$, 19.26$\times$, and 1.87$\times$ for LeNet, VGG-5, HEFNet, and ResNet-20 respectively, with negligible accuracy loss.

Policy Regularization with Dataset Constraint for Offline Reinforcement Learning	We consider the problem of learning the best possible policy from a fixed dataset, known as offline Reinforcement Learning (RL). A common taxonomy of existing offline RL works is policy regularization, which typically constrains the learned policy by distribution or support of the behavior policy. However, distribution and support constraints are overly conservative since they both force the policy to choose similar actions as the behavior policy when considering particular states. It will limit the learned policy's performance, especially when the behavior policy is sub-optimal. In this paper, we find that regularizing the policy towards the nearest state-action pair can be more effective and thus propose Policy Regularization with Dataset Constraint (PRDC). When updating the policy in a given state, PRDC searches the entire dataset for the nearest state-action sample and then restricts the policy with the action of this sample. Unlike previous works, PRDC can guide the policy with proper behaviors from the dataset, allowing it to choose actions that do not appear in the dataset along with the given state. It is a softer constraint but still keeps enough conservatism from out-of-distribution actions. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis show that PRDC can alleviate offline RL's fundamentally challenging value overestimation issue with a bounded performance gap. Moreover, on a set of locomotion and navigation tasks, PRDC achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing methods.

A Picture of the Space of Typical Learnable Tasks	We develop information geometric techniques to understand the representations learned by deep networks when they are trained on different tasks using supervised, meta-, semi-supervised and contrastive learning. We shed light on the following phenomena that relate to the structure of the space of tasks: (1) the manifold of probabilistic models trained on different tasks using different representation learning methods is effectively low-dimensional; (2) supervised learning on one task results in a surprising amount of progress even on seemingly dissimilar tasks; progress on other tasks is larger if the training task has diverse classes; (3) the structure of the space of tasks indicated by our analysis is consistent with parts of the Wordnet phylogenetic tree; (4) episodic meta-learning algorithms and supervised learning traverse different trajectories during training but they fit similar models eventually; (5) contrastive and semi-supervised learning methods traverse trajectories similar to those of supervised learning. We use classification tasks constructed from the CIFAR-10 and Imagenet datasets to study these phenomena.

Model Ratatouille: Recycling Diverse Models for Out-of-Distribution Generalization	Foundation models are redefining how AI systems are built. Practitioners now follow a standard procedure to build their machine learning solutions: from a pre-trained foundation model, they fine-tune the weights on the target task of interest. So, the Internet is swarmed by a handful of foundation models fine-tuned on many diverse tasks: these individual fine-tunings exist in isolation without benefiting from each other. In our opinion, this is a missed opportunity, as these specialized models contain rich and diverse features. In this paper, we thus propose model ratatouille, a new strategy to recycle the multiple fine-tunings of the same foundation model on diverse auxiliary tasks. Specifically, we repurpose these auxiliary weights as initializations for multiple parallel fine-tunings on the target task; then, we average all fine-tuned weights to obtain the final model. This recycling strategy aims at maximizing the diversity in weights by leveraging the diversity in auxiliary tasks. Empirically, it improves the state of the art on the reference DomainBed benchmark for out-of-distribution generalization. Looking forward, this work contributes to the emerging paradigm of updatable machine learning where, akin to open-source software development, the community collaborates to reliably update machine learning models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/rame23a	Alexandre Rame, Kartik Ahuja, Jianyu Zhang, Matthieu Cord, Leon Bottou, David Lopez-Paz
How much does Initialization Affect Generalization?	Characterizing the remarkable generalization properties of over-parameterized neural networks remains an open problem. A growing body of recent literature shows that the bias of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and architecture choice implicitly leads to better generalization. In this paper, we show on the contrary that, independently of architecture, SGD can itself be the cause of poor generalization if one does not ensure good initialization. Specifically, we prove that	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ramasinghe23a	Sameera Ramasinghe, Lachlan Ewen Macdonald, Moshiur Farazi, Hemanth Saratchandran, Simon Lucey
SpotEM: Efficient Video Search for Episodic Memory	"The goal in episodic memory (EM) is to search a long egocentric video to answer a natural language query (e.g., ""where did I leave my purse?""). Existing EM methods exhaustively extract expensive fixed-length clip features to look everywhere in the video for the answer, which is infeasible for long wearable-camera videos that span hours or even days. We propose SpotEM, an approach to achieve efficiency for a given EM method while maintaining good accuracy. SpotEM consists of three key ideas: 1) a novel clip selector that learns to identify promising video regions to search conditioned on the language query; 2) a set of low-cost semantic indexing features that capture the context of rooms, objects, and interactions that suggest where to look; and 3) distillation losses that address the optimization issues arising from end-to-end joint training of the clip selector and EM model. Our experiments on 200+ hours of video from the Ego4D EM Natural Language Queries benchmark and three different EM models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: computing only 10% – 25% of the clip features, we preserve 84% – 97% of the original EM model's accuracy.

Mastering the Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning Benchmark from Pixels	Controlling artificial agents from visual sensory data is an arduous task. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can succeed but require large amounts of interactions between the agent and the environment. To alleviate the issue, unsupervised RL proposes to employ self-supervised interaction and learning, for adapting faster to future tasks. Yet, as shown in the Unsupervised RL Benchmark (URLB; Laskin et al. 2021), whether current unsupervised strategies can improve generalization capabilities is still unclear, especially in visual control settings. In this work, we study the URLB and propose a new method to solve it, using unsupervised model-based RL, for pre-training the agent, and a task-aware fine-tuning strategy combined with a new proposed hybrid planner, Dyna-MPC, to adapt the agent for downstream tasks. On URLB, our method obtains 93.59% overall normalized performance, surpassing previous baselines by a staggering margin. The approach is empirically evaluated through a large-scale empirical study, which we use to validate our design choices and analyze our models. We also show robust performance on the Real-Word RL benchmark, hinting at resiliency to environment perturbations during adaptation.

Algorithmic Stability of Heavy-Tailed SGD with General Loss Functions	Heavy-tail phenomena in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) have been reported in several empirical studies. Experimental evidence in previous works suggests a strong interplay between the heaviness of the tails and generalization behavior of SGD. To address this empirical phenomena theoretically, several works have made strong topological and statistical assumptions to link the generalization error to heavy tails. Very recently, new generalization bounds have been proven, indicating a non-monotonic relationship between the generalization error and heavy tails, which is more pertinent to the reported empirical observations. While these bounds do not require additional topological assumptions given that SGD can be modeled using a heavy-tailed stochastic differential equation (SDE), they can only apply to simple quadratic problems. In this paper, we build on this line of research and develop generalization bounds for a more general class of objective functions, which includes non-convex functions as well. Our approach is based on developing Wasserstein stability bounds for heavy-tailed SDEs and their discretizations, which we then convert to generalization bounds. Our results do not require any nontrivial assumptions; yet, they shed more light to the empirical observations, thanks to the generality of the loss functions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/raj23a	Anant Raj, Lingjiong Zhu, Mert Gurbuzbalaban, Umut Simsekli
Recovery Bounds on Class-Based Optimal Transport: A Sum-of-Norms Regularization Framework	We develop a novel theoretical framework for understating Optimal Transport (OT) schemes respecting a class structure. For this purpose, we propose a convex OT program with a sum-of-norms regularization term, which provably recovers the underlying class structure under geometric assumptions. Furthermore, we derive an accelerated proximal algorithm with a closed-form projection and proximal operator scheme, thereby affording a more scalable algorithm for computing optimal transport plans. We provide a novel argument for the uniqueness of the optimum even in the absence of strong convexity. Our experiments show that the new regularizer not only results in a better preservation of the class structure in the data but also yields additional robustness to the data geometry, compared to previous regularizers.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/rahbar23a	Arman Rahbar, Ashkan Panahi, Morteza Haghir Chehreghani, Devdatt Dubhashi, Hamid Krim
Sequential Multi-Dimensional Self-Supervised Learning for Clinical Time Series	Self-supervised learning (SSL) for clinical time series data has received significant attention in recent literature, since these data are highly rich and provide important information about a patient's physiological state. However, most existing SSL methods for clinical time series are limited in that they are designed for unimodal time series, such as a sequence of structured features (e.g., lab values and vitals signs) or an individual high-dimensional physiological signal (e.g., an electrocardiogram). These existing methods cannot be readily extended to model time series that exhibit multimodality, with structured features and high-dimensional data being recorded at each timestep in the sequence. In this work, we address this gap and propose a new SSL method — Sequential Multi-Dimensional SSL — where a SSL loss is applied both at the level of the entire sequence and at the level of the individual high-dimensional data points in the sequence in order to better capture information at both scales. Our strategy is agnostic to the specific form of loss function used at each level – it can be contrastive, as in SimCLR, or non-contrastive, as in VICReg. We evaluate our method on two real-world clinical datasets, where the time series contains sequences of (1) high-frequency electrocardiograms and (2) structured data from lab values and vitals signs. Our experimental results indicate that pre-training with our method and then fine-tuning on downstream tasks improves performance over baselines on both datasets, and in several settings, can lead to improvements across different self-supervised loss functions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/raghu23a	Aniruddh Raghu, Payal Chandak, Ridwan Alam, John Guttag, Collin Stultz
Shiftable Context: Addressing Training-Inference Context Mismatch in Simultaneous Speech Translation	Transformer models using segment-based processing have been an effective architecture for simultaneous speech translation. However, such models create a context mismatch between training and inference environments, hindering potential translation accuracy. We solve this issue by proposing Shiftable Context, a simple yet effective scheme to ensure that consistent segment and context sizes are maintained throughout training and inference, even with the presence of partially filled segments due to the streaming nature of simultaneous translation. Shiftable Context is also broadly applicable to segment-based transformers for streaming tasks. Our experiments on the English-German, English-French, and English-Spanish language pairs from the MUST-C dataset demonstrate that when applied to the Augmented Memory Transformer, a state-of-the-art model for simultaneous speech translation, the proposed scheme achieves an average increase of 2.09, 1.83, and 1.95 BLEU scores across each wait-k value for the three language pairs, respectively, with a minimal impact on computation-aware Average Lagging.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/raffel23a	Matthew Raffel, Drew Penney, Lizhong Chen
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision	We study the capabilities of speech processing systems trained simply to predict large amounts of transcripts of audio on the internet. When scaled to 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervision, the resulting models generalize well to standard benchmarks and are often competitive with prior fully supervised results without the need for any dataset specific fine-tuning. When compared to humans, the models approach their accuracy and robustness. We are releasing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for further work on robust speech processing.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/radford23a	Alec Radford, Jong Wook Kim, Tao Xu, Greg Brockman, Christine Mcleavey, Ilya Sutskever
DRCFS: Doubly Robust Causal Feature Selection	Knowing the features of a complex system that are highly relevant to a particular target variable is of fundamental interest in many areas of science. Existing approaches are often limited to linear settings, sometimes lack guarantees, and in most cases, do not scale to the problem at hand, in particular to images. We propose DRCFS, a doubly robust feature selection method for identifying the causal features even in nonlinear and high dimensional settings. We provide theoretical guarantees, illustrate necessary conditions for our assumptions, and perform extensive experiments across a wide range of simulated and semi-synthetic datasets. DRCFS significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, selecting robust features even in challenging highly non-linear and high-dimensional problems.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/quinzan23a	Francesco Quinzan, Ashkan Soleymani, Patrick Jaillet, Cristian R.

Simple and Fast Group Robustness by Automatic Feature Reweighting	A major challenge to out-of-distribution generalization is reliance on spurious features — patterns that are predictive of the class label in the training data distribution, but not causally related to the target. Standard methods for reducing the reliance on spurious features typically assume that we know what the spurious feature is, which is rarely true in the real world. Methods that attempt to alleviate this limitation are complex, hard to tune, and lead to a significant computational overhead compared to standard training. In this paper, we propose Automatic Feature Reweighting (AFR), an extremely simple and fast method for updating the model to reduce the reliance on spurious features. AFR retrains the last layer of a standard ERM-trained base model with a weighted loss that emphasizes the examples where the ERM model predicts poorly, automatically upweighting the minority group without group labels. With this simple procedure, we improve upon the best reported results among competing methods trained without spurious attributes on several vision and natural language classification benchmarks, using only a fraction of their compute.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/qiu23c	Shikai Qiu, Andres Potapczynski, Pavel Izmailov, Andrew Gordon Wilson
Shortest Edit Path Crossover: A Theory-driven Solution to the Permutation Problem in Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search	Population-based search has recently emerged as a possible alternative to Reinforcement Learning (RL) for black-box neural architecture search (NAS). It performs well in practice even though it is not theoretically well understood. In particular, whereas traditional population-based search methods such as evolutionary algorithms (EAs) draw much power from crossover operations, it is difficult to take advantage of them in NAS. The main obstacle is believed to be the permutation problem: The mapping between genotype and phenotype in traditional graph representations is many-to-one, leading to a disruptive effect of standard crossover. This paper presents the first theoretical analysis of the behaviors of mutation, crossover and RL in black-box NAS, and proposes a new crossover operator based on the shortest edit path (SEP) in graph space. The SEP crossover is shown theoretically to overcome the permutation problem, and as a result, have a better expected improvement compared to mutation, standard crossover and RL. Further, it empirically outperform these other methods on state-of-the-art NAS benchmarks. The SEP crossover therefore allows taking full advantage of population-based search in NAS, and the underlying theory can serve as a foundation for deeper understanding of black-box NAS methods in general.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/qiu23b	Xin Qiu, Risto Miikkulainen
Not All Semantics are Created Equal: Contrastive Self-supervised Learning with Automatic Temperature Individualization	"In this paper, we aim to optimize a contrastive loss with individualized temperatures in a principled manner. The common practice of using a global temperature parameter $\tau$ ignores the fact that ""not all semantics are created equal"", meaning that different anchor data may have different numbers of samples with similar semantics, especially when data exhibits long-tails. First, we propose a new robust contrastive loss inspired by distributionally robust optimization (DRO), providing us an intuition about the effect of $\tau$ and a mechanism for automatic temperature individualization. Then, we propose an efficient stochastic algorithm for optimizing the robust contrastive loss with a provable convergence guarantee without using large mini-batch sizes. Theoretical and experimental results show that our algorithm automatically learns a suitable $\tau$ for each sample. Specifically, samples with frequent semantics use large temperatures to keep local semantic structures, while samples with rare semantics use small temperatures to induce more separable features. Our method not only outperforms prior strong baselines (e.g., SimCLR, CLIP) on unimodal and bimodal tasks with larger improvements on imbalanced data but also is less sensitive to hyper-parameters. To our best knowledge, this is the first methodical approach to optimizing a contrastive loss with individualized temperatures. Our proposed algorithms are implemented in the LibAUC library at https://libauc.org."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/qiu23a	Zi-Hao Qiu, Quanqi Hu, Zhuoning Yuan, Denny Zhou, Lijun Zhang, Tianbao Yang
BiBench: Benchmarking and Analyzing Network Binarization	Network binarization emerges as one of the most promising compression approaches offering extraordinary computation and memory savings by minimizing the bit-width. However, recent research has shown that applying existing binarization algorithms to diverse tasks, architectures, and hardware in realistic scenarios is still not straightforward. Common challenges of binarization, such as accuracy degradation and efficiency limitation, suggest that its attributes are not fully understood. To close this gap, we present BiBench, a rigorously designed benchmark with in-depth analysis for network binarization. We first carefully scrutinize the requirements of binarization in the actual production and define evaluation tracks and metrics for a comprehensive and fair investigation. Then, we evaluate and analyze a series of milestone binarization algorithms that function at the operator level and with extensive influence. Our benchmark reveals that 1) the binarized operator has a crucial impact on the performance and deployability of binarized networks; 2) the accuracy of binarization varies significantly across different learning tasks and neural architectures; 3) binarization has demonstrated promising efficiency potential on edge devices despite the limited hardware support. The results and analysis also lead to a promising paradigm for accurate and efficient binarization. We believe that BiBench will contribute to the broader adoption of binarization and serve as a foundation for future research.

Nugget: Neural Agglomerative Embeddings of Text	Embedding text sequences is a widespread requirement in modern language understanding. Existing approaches focus largely on constant-size representations. This is problematic, as the amount of information contained in text often varies with the length of the input. We propose a solution called Nugget, which encodes language into a representation based on a dynamically selected subset of input tokens. These nuggets are learned through tasks like autoencoding and machine translation, and intuitively segment language into meaningful units. We demonstrate Nugget outperforms related approaches in tasks involving semantic comparison. Finally, we illustrate these compact units allow for expanding the contextual window of a language model (LM), suggesting new future LMs that can condition on significantly larger amounts of content.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/qin23a	Guanghui Qin, Benjamin Van Durme
FREDIS: A Fusion Framework of Refinement and Disambiguation for Unreliable Partial Label Learning	To reduce the difficulty of annotation, partial label learning (PLL) has been widely studied, where each example is ambiguously annotated with a set of candidate labels instead of the exact correct label. PLL assumes that the candidate label set contains the correct label, which induces disambiguation, i.e., identification of the correct label in the candidate label set, adopted in most PLL methods. However, this assumption is impractical as no one could guarantee the existence of the correct label in the candidate label set under real-world scenarios. Therefore, Unreliable Partial Label Learning (UPLL) is investigated where the correct label of each example may not exist in the candidate label set. In this paper, we propose a fusion framework of refinement and disambiguation named FREDIS to handle the UPLL problem. Specifically, with theoretical guarantees, not only does disambiguation move incorrect labels from candidate labels to non-candidate labels but also refinement, an opposite procedure, moves correct labels from non-candidate labels to candidate labels. Besides, we prove that the classifier trained by our framework could eventually approximate the Bayes optimal classifier. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/qiao23b	Congyu Qiao, Ning Xu, Jiaqi Lv, Yi Ren, Xin Geng
Collaborative Causal Inference with Fair Incentives	Collaborative causal inference (CCI) aims to improve the estimation of the causal effect of treatment variables by utilizing data aggregated from multiple self-interested parties. Since their source data are valuable proprietary assets that can be costly or tedious to obtain, every party has to be incentivized to be willing to contribute to the collaboration, such as with a guaranteed fair and sufficiently valuable reward (than performing causal inference on its own). This paper presents a reward scheme designed using the unique statistical properties that are required by causal inference to guarantee certain desirable incentive criteria (e.g., fairness, benefit) for the parties based on their contributions. To achieve this, we propose a data valuation function to value parties' data for CCI based on the distributional closeness of its resulting treatment effect estimate to that utilizing the aggregated data from all parties. Then, we show how to value the parties' rewards fairly based on a modified variant of the Shapley value arising from our proposed data valuation for CCI. Finally, the Shapley fair rewards to the parties are realized in the form of improved, stochastically perturbed treatment effect estimates. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our reward scheme using simulated and real-world datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/qiao23a	Rui Qiao, Xinyi Xu, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low
Coarse-to-Fine: a Hierarchical Diffusion Model for Molecule Generation in 3D	Generating desirable molecular structures in 3D is a fundamental problem for drug discovery. Despite the considerable progress we have achieved, existing methods usually generate molecules in atom resolution and ignore intrinsic local structures such as rings, which leads to poor quality in generated structures, especially when generating large molecules. Fragment-based molecule generation is a promising strategy, however, it is nontrivial to be adapted for 3D non-autoregressive generations because of the combinational optimization problems. In this paper, we utilize a coarse-to-fine strategy to tackle this problem, in which a Hierarchical Diffusion-based model (i.e. HierDiff) is proposed to preserve the validity of local segments without relying on autoregressive modeling. Specifically, HierDiff first generates coarse-grained molecule geometries via an equivariant diffusion process, where each coarse-grained node reflects a fragment in a molecule. Then the coarse-grained nodes are decoded into fine-grained fragments by a message-passing process and a newly designed iterative refined sampling module. Lastly, the fine-grained fragments are then assembled to derive a complete atomic molecular structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HierDiff consistently improves the quality of molecule generation over existing methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/qiang23a	Bo Qiang, Yuxuan Song, Minkai Xu, Jingjing Gong, Bowen Gao, Hao Zhou, Wei-Ying Ma, Yanyan Lan
An Effective Meaningful Way to Evaluate Survival Models	One straightforward metric to evaluate a survival prediction model is based on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) – the average of the absolute difference between the time predicted by the model and the true event time, over all subjects. Unfortunately, this is challenging because, in practice, the test set includes (right) censored individuals, meaning we do not know when a censored individual actually experienced the event. In this paper, we explore various metrics to estimate MAE for survival datasets that include (many) censored individuals. Moreover, we introduce a novel and effective approach for generating realistic semi-synthetic survival datasets to facilitate the evaluation of metrics. Our findings, based on the analysis of the semi-synthetic datasets, reveal that our proposed metric (MAE using pseudo-observations) is able to rank models accurately based on their performance, and often closely matches the true MAE – in particular, is better than several alternative methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/qi23b	Shi-Ang Qi, Neeraj Kumar, Mahtab Farrokh, Weijie Sun, Li-Hao Kuan, Rajesh Ranganath, Ricardo Henao, Russell Greiner
Contrast with Reconstruct: Contrastive 3D Representation Learning Guided by Generative Pretraining	Mainstream 3D representation learning approaches are built upon contrastive or generative modeling pretext tasks, where great improvements in performance on various downstream tasks have been achieved. However, we find these two paradigms have different characteristics: (i) contrastive models are data-hungry that suffer from a representation over-fitting issue; (ii) generative models have a data filling issue that shows inferior data scaling capacity compared to contrastive models. This motivates us to learn 3D representations by sharing the merits of both paradigms, which is non-trivial due to the pattern difference between the two paradigms. In this paper, we propose contrast with reconstruct (ReCon) that unifies these two paradigms. ReCon is trained to learn from both generative modeling teachers and cross-modal contrastive teachers through ensemble distillation, where the generative student is used to guide the contrastive student. An encoder-decoder style ReCon-block is proposed that transfers knowledge through cross attention with stop-gradient, which avoids pretraining over-fitting and pattern difference issues. ReCon achieves a new state-of-the-art in 3D representation learning, e.g., 91.26% accuracy on ScanObjectNN. Codes have been released at https://github.com/qizekun/ReCon.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/qi23a	Zekun Qi, Runpei Dong, Guofan Fan, Zheng Ge, Xiangyu Zhang, Kaisheng Ma, Li Yi
Equivariant Polynomials for Graph Neural Networks	Graph Neural Networks (GNN) are inherently limited in their expressive power. Recent seminal works (Xu et al., 2019; Morris et al., 2019b) introduced the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) hierarchy as a measure of expressive power. Although this hierarchy has propelled significant advances in GNN analysis and architecture developments, it suffers from several significant limitations. These include a complex definition that lacks direct guidance for model improvement and a WL hierarchy that is too coarse to study current GNNs. This paper introduces an alternative expressive power hierarchy based on the ability of GNNs to calculate equivariant polynomials of a certain degree. As a first step, we provide a full characterization of all equivariant graph polynomials by introducing a concrete basis, significantly generalizing previous results. Each basis element corresponds to a specific multi-graph, and its computation over some graph data input corresponds to a tensor contraction problem. Second, we propose algorithmic tools for evaluating the expressiveness of GNNs using tensor contraction sequences, and calculate the expressive power of popular GNNs. Finally, we enhance the expressivity of common GNN architectures by adding polynomial features or additional operations / aggregations inspired by our theory. These enhanced GNNs demonstrate state-of-the-art results in experiments across multiple graph learning benchmarks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/puny23a	Omri Puny, Derek Lim, Bobak Kiani, Haggai Maron, Yaron Lipman
JAWS-X: Addressing Efficiency Bottlenecks of Conformal Prediction Under Standard and Feedback Covariate Shift	We study the efficient estimation of predictive confidence intervals for black-box predictors when the common data exchangeability (e.g., i.i.d.) assumption is violated due to potentially feedback-induced shifts in the input data distribution. That is, we focus on standard and feedback covariate shift (FCS), where the latter allows for feedback dependencies between train and test data that occur in many decision-making scenarios like experimental design. Whereas prior conformal prediction methods for this problem are in general either extremely computationally demanding or make inefficient use of labeled data, we propose a collection of methods based on the jackknife+ that achieve a practical balance of computational and statistical efficiency. Theoretically, our proposed JAW-FCS method extends the rigorous, finite-sample coverage guarantee of the jackknife+ to FCS. We moreover propose two tunable relaxations to JAW-FCS's computation that maintain finite-sample guarantees: one using only $K$ leave-one-out models (JAW-$K$LOO) and a second building on $K$-fold cross validation+ (WCV+). Practically, we demonstrate that JAW-FCS and its computational relaxations outperform state-of-the-art baselines on a variety of real-world datasets under standard and feedback covariate shift, including for biomolecular design and active learning tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/prinster23a	Drew Prinster, Suchi Saria, Anqi Liu
Test-time Adaptation with Slot-Centric Models	Current visual detectors, though impressive within their training distribution, often fail to parse out-of-distribution scenes into their constituent entities. Recent test-time adaptation methods use auxiliary self-supervised losses to adapt the network parameters to each test example independently and have shown promising results towards generalization outside the training distribution for the task of image classification. In our work, we find evidence that these losses are insufficient for the task of scene decomposition, without also considering architectural inductive biases. Recent slot-centric generative models attempt to decompose scenes into entities in a self-supervised manner by reconstructing pixels. Drawing upon these two lines of work, we propose Slot-TTA, a semi-supervised slot-centric scene decomposition model that at test time is adapted per scene through gradient descent on reconstruction or cross-view synthesis objectives. We evaluate Slot-TTA across multiple input modalities, images or 3D point clouds, and show substantial out-of-distribution performance improvements against state-of-the-art supervised feed-forward detectors, and alternative test-time adaptation methods.

Minimax estimation of discontinuous optimal transport maps: The semi-discrete case	We consider the problem of estimating the optimal transport map between two probability distributions, $P$ and $Q$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, on the basis of i.i.d. samples. All existing statistical analyses of this problem require the assumption that the transport map is Lipschitz, a strong requirement that, in particular, excludes any examples where the transport map is discontinuous. As a first step towards developing estimation procedures for discontinuous maps, we consider the important special case where the data distribution $Q$ is a discrete measure supported on a finite number of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We study a computationally efficient estimator initially proposed by (Pooladian & Niles-Weed, 2021), based on entropic optimal transport, and show in the semi-discrete setting that it converges at the minimax-optimal rate $n^{-1/2}$, independent of dimension. Other standard map estimation techniques both lack finite-sample guarantees in this setting and provably suffer from the curse of dimensionality. We confirm these results in numerical experiments, and provide experiments for other settings, not covered by our theory, which indicate that the entropic estimator is a promising methodology for other discontinuous transport map estimation problems.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/pooladian23b	Aram-Alexandre Pooladian, Vincent Divol, Jonathan Niles-Weed
Multisample Flow Matching: Straightening Flows with Minibatch Couplings	Simulation-free methods for training continuous-time generative models construct probability paths that go between noise distributions and individual data samples. Recent works, such as Flow Matching, derived paths that are optimal for each data sample. However, these algorithms rely on independent data and noise samples, and do not exploit underlying structure in the data distribution for constructing probability paths. We propose Multisample Flow Matching, a more general framework that uses non-trivial couplings between data and noise samples while satisfying the correct marginal constraints. At small overhead costs, this generalization allows us to (i) reduce gradient variance during training, (ii) obtain straighter flows for the learned vector field, which allows us to generate high-quality samples using fewer function evaluations, and (iii) obtain transport maps with low cost in high dimensions, which has applications beyond generative modeling. Importantly, we do so in a completely simulation-free manner with a simple minimization objective. We show that our proposed methods improve sample consistency on downsampled ImageNet data sets, and lead to better low-cost sample generation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/pooladian23a	Aram-Alexandre Pooladian, Heli Ben-Hamu, Carles Domingo-Enrich, Brandon Amos, Yaron Lipman, Ricky T.

Spurious Valleys and Clustering Behavior of Neural Networks	Neural networks constitute a class of functions that are typically non-surjective, with high-dimensional fibers and complicated image. We prove two main results concerning the geometry of the loss landscape of a neural network. First, we provide an explicit effective bound on the sizes of the hidden layers so that the loss landscape has no spurious valleys, which guarantees the success of gradient descent methods. Second, we present a novel method for analyzing whether a given neural network architecture with monomial activation function can represent a target function of interest. The core of our analysis method is the study of a specific set of error values, and its behavior depending on different training datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/pollaci23a	Samuele Pollaci
Hyena Hierarchy: Towards Larger Convolutional Language Models	Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large Transformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers at scale, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In challenging reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-space models, transfer functions, and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets WikiText103 and The Pile, reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2k. Hyena operators are 2x faster than highly optimized attention at sequence length 8k, with speedups of 100x at 64k.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/poli23a	Michael Poli, Stefano Massaroli, Eric Nguyen, Daniel Y Fu, Tri Dao, Stephen Baccus, Yoshua Bengio, Stefano Ermon, Christopher Re
Truncating Trajectories in Monte Carlo Reinforcement Learning	In Reinforcement Learning (RL), an agent acts in an unknown environment to maximize the expected cumulative discounted sum of an external reward signal, i.e., the expected return.

Sequential Kernelized Independence Testing	Independence testing is a classical statistical problem that has been extensively studied in the batch setting when one fixes the sample size before collecting data. However, practitioners often prefer procedures that adapt to the complexity of a problem at hand instead of setting sample size in advance. Ideally, such procedures should (a) stop earlier on easy tasks (and later on harder tasks), hence making better use of available resources, and (b) continuously monitor the data and efficiently incorporate statistical evidence after collecting new data, while controlling the false alarm rate. Classical batch tests are not tailored for streaming data: valid inference after data peeking requires correcting for multiple testing which results in low power. Following the principle of testing by betting, we design sequential kernelized independence tests that overcome such shortcomings. We exemplify our broad framework using bets inspired by kernelized dependence measures, e.g., the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion. Our test is also valid under non-i.i.d. time-varying settings. We demonstrate the power of our approaches on both simulated and real data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/podkopaev23a	Aleksandr Podkopaev, Patrick Blöbaum, Shiva Kasiviswanathan, Aaditya Ramdas
Universal Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Symbolic Differential Operator Discovery with Sparse Data	In this work we perform symbolic discovery of differential operators in a situation where there is sparse experimental data. This small data regime in machine learning can be made tractable by providing our algorithms with prior information about the underlying dynamics. Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been very successful in this regime (reconstructing entire ODE solutions using only a single point or entire PDE solutions with very few measurements of the initial condition). The Universal PINN approach (UPINN) adds a neural network that learns a representation of unknown hidden terms in the differential equation. The algorithm yields both a surrogate solution to the differential equation and a black-box representation of the hidden terms. These hidden term neural networks can then be converted into symbolic equations using symbolic regression techniques like AI Feynman. In order to achieve convergence of the neural networks, we provide our algorithms with (noisy) measurements of both the initial condition as well as (synthetic) experimental data obtained at later times. We demonstrate strong performance of UPINNs even when provided with very few measurements of noisy data in both the ODE and PDE regime.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/podina23a	Lena Podina, Brydon Eastman, Mohammad Kohandel
Conformal Prediction for Federated Uncertainty Quantification Under Label Shift	Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning framework where many clients collaboratively train models while keeping the training data decentralized. Despite recent advances in FL, the uncertainty quantification topic (UQ) remains partially addressed. Among UQ methods, conformal prediction (CP) approaches provides distribution-free guarantees under minimal assumptions. We develop a new federated conformal prediction method based on quantile regression and take into account privacy constraints. This method takes advantage of importance weighting to effectively address the label shift between agents and provides theoretical guarantees for both valid coverage of the prediction sets and differential privacy. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate that this method outperforms current competitors.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/plassier23a	Vincent Plassier, Mehdi Makni, Aleksandr Rubashevskii, Eric Moulines, Maxim Panov
Linear CNNs Discover the Statistical Structure of the Dataset Using Only the Most Dominant Frequencies	"We here present a stepping stone towards a deeper understanding of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the form of a theory of learning in linear CNNs. Through analyzing the gradient descent equations, we discover that the evolution of the network during training is determined by the interplay between the dataset structure and the convolutional network structure. We show that linear CNNs discover the statistical structure of the dataset with non-linear, ordered, stage-like transitions, and that the speed of discovery changes depending on the relationship between the dataset and the convolutional network structure. Moreover, we find that this interplay lies at the heart of what we call the ""dominant frequency bias"", where linear CNNs arrive at these discoveries using only the dominant frequencies of the different structural parts present in the dataset. We furthermore provide experiments that show how our theory relates to deep, non-linear CNNs used in practice. Our findings shed new light on the inner working of CNNs, and can help explain their shortcut learning and their tendency to rely on texture instead of shape."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/pinson23a	Hannah Pinson, Joeri Lenaerts, Vincent Ginis
HyperTuning: Toward Adapting Large Language Models without Back-propagation	Fine-tuning large language models for different tasks can be costly and inefficient, and even methods that reduce the number of tuned parameters still require full gradient-based optimization. We propose HyperTuning, a novel approach to model adaptation that uses a hypermodel to generate task-specific parameters for a fixed downstream model. We demonstrate a simple setup for hypertuning with HyperT5, a T5-based hypermodel that produces soft prefixes or LoRA parameters for a frozen T5 model from few-shot examples. We train HyperT5 in two stages: first, hyperpretraining with a modified conditional language modeling objective that trains a hypermodel to generate parameters; second, multi-task fine-tuning (MTF) on a large number of diverse language tasks. We evaluate HyperT5 on P3, MetaICL and Super-NaturalInstructions datasets, and show that it can effectively generate parameters for unseen tasks. Moreover, we show that using hypermodel-generated parameters as initializations for further parameter-efficient fine-tuning improves performance. HyperTuning can thus be a flexible and efficient way to leverage large language models for diverse downstream applications.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/phang23a	Jason Phang, Yi Mao, Pengcheng He, Weizhu Chen
Attention-Based Recurrence for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning under Stochastic Partial Observability	Stochastic partial observability poses a major challenge for decentralized coordination in multi-agent reinforcement learning but is largely neglected in state-of-the-art research due to a strong focus on state-based centralized training for decentralized execution (CTDE) and benchmarks that lack sufficient stochasticity like StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC). In this paper, we propose Attention-based Embeddings of Recurrence In multi-Agent Learning (AERIAL) to approximate value functions under stochastic partial observability. AERIAL replaces the true state with a learned representation of multi-agent recurrence, considering more accurate information about decentralized agent decisions than state-based CTDE. We then introduce MessySMAC, a modified version of SMAC with stochastic observations and higher variance in initial states, to provide a more general and configurable benchmark regarding stochastic partial observability. We evaluate AERIAL in Dec-Tiger as well as in a variety of SMAC and MessySMAC maps, and compare the results with state-based CTDE. Furthermore, we evaluate the robustness of AERIAL and state-based CTDE against various stochasticity configurations in MessySMAC.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/phan23a	Thomy Phan, Fabian Ritz, Philipp Altmann, Maximilian Zorn, Jonas Nüßlein, Michael Kölle, Thomas Gabor, Claudia Linnhoff-Popien
A Scalable Frank-Wolfe-Based Algorithm for the Max-Cut SDP	We consider the problem of solving large-scale instances of the Max-Cut semidefinite program (SDP), i.e., optimizing a linear function over $n\times n$ positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices with unit diagonal. When the cost matrix is PSD, we show how to exactly reformulate the problem as maximizing a smooth concave function over PSD matrices with unit trace. By applying the Frank-Wolfe method, we obtain a simple algorithm that is compatible with recent sampling-based techniques to solve SDPs using low memory. We demonstrate the practical performance of our method on $10^6\times 10^6$ instances of the max-cut SDP with costs having up to $5 \times 10^6$ non-zero entries. Theoretically, we show that our method solves problems with diagonally dominant costs to relative error $\epsilon$ in $O(n\epsilon^{-1})$ calls to a randomized approximate largest eigenvalue subroutine, each of which succeeds with high probability after $O(\log(n)\epsilon^{-1/2})$ matrix-vector multiplications with the cost matrix.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/pham23a	Chi Bach Pham, Wynita Griggs, James Saunderson
The Power of Learned Locally Linear Models for Nonlinear Policy Optimization	A common pipeline in learning-based control is to iteratively estimate a model of system dynamics, and apply a trajectory optimization algorithm - e.g. $\mathtt{iLQR}$ - on the learned model to minimize a target cost. This paper conducts a rigorous analysis of a simplified variant of this strategy for general nonlinear systems. We analyze an algorithm which iterates between estimating local linear models of nonlinear system dynamics and performing $\mathtt{iLQR}$-like policy updates. We demonstrate that this algorithm attains sample complexity polynomial in relevant problem parameters, and, by synthesizing locally stabilizing gains, overcomes exponential dependence in problem horizon. Experimental results validate the performance of our algorithm, and compare to natural deep-learning baselines.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/pfrommer23a	Daniel Pfrommer, Max Simchowitz, Tyler Westenbroek, Nikolai Matni, Stephen Tu
Certifying Ensembles: A General Certification Theory with S-Lipschitzness	Improving and guaranteeing the robustness of deep learning models has been a topic of intense research. Ensembling, which combines several classifiers to provide a better model, has been shown to be beneficial for generalisation, uncertainty estimation, calibration, and mitigating the effects of concept drift. However, the impact of ensembling on certified robustness is less well understood. In this work, we generalise Lipschitz continuity by introducing S-Lipschitz classifiers, which we use to analyse the theoretical robustness of ensembles. Our results are precise conditions when ensembles of robust classifiers are more robust than any constituent classifier, as well as conditions when they are less robust.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/petrov23a	Aleksandar Petrov, Francisco Eiras, Amartya Sanyal, Philip Torr, Adel Bibi
Are Gaussian Data All You Need? The Extents and Limits of Universality in High-Dimensional Generalized Linear Estimation	"In this manuscript we consider the problem of generalized linear estimation on Gaussian mixture data with labels given by a single-index model. Our first result is a sharp asymptotic expression for the test and training errors in the high-dimensional regime. Motivated by the recent stream of results on the Gaussian universality of the test and training errors in generalized linear estimation, we ask ourselves the question: ""when is a single Gaussian enough to characterize the error?"". Our formula allows us to give sharp answers to this question, both in the positive and negative directions. More precisely, we show that the sufficient conditions for Gaussian universality (or lack thereof) crucially depend on the alignment between the target weights and the means and covariances of the mixture clusters, which we precisely quantify. In the particular case of least-squares interpolation, we prove a strong universality property of the training error and show it follows a simple, closed-form expression. Finally, we apply our results to real datasets, clarifying some recent discussions in the literature about Gaussian universality of the errors in this context."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/pesce23a	Luca Pesce, Florent Krzakala, Bruno Loureiro, Ludovic Stephan
Estimating the Contamination Factor’s Distribution in Unsupervised Anomaly Detection	Anomaly detection methods identify examples that do not follow the expected behaviour, typically in an unsupervised fashion, by assigning real-valued anomaly scores to the examples based on various heuristics. These scores need to be transformed into actual predictions by thresholding so that the proportion of examples marked as anomalies equals the expected proportion of anomalies, called contamination factor. Unfortunately, there are no good methods for estimating the contamination factor itself. We address this need from a Bayesian perspective, introducing a method for estimating the posterior distribution of the contamination factor for a given unlabeled dataset. We leverage several anomaly detectors to capture the basic notion of anomalousness and estimate the contamination using a specific mixture formulation. Empirically on 22 datasets, we show that the estimated distribution is well-calibrated and that setting the threshold using the posterior mean improves the detectors' performance over several alternative methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/perini23a	Lorenzo Perini, Paul-Christian Bürkner, Arto Klami

MolDiff: Addressing the Atom-Bond Inconsistency Problem in 3D Molecule Diffusion Generation	Deep generative models have recently achieved superior performance in 3D molecule generation. Most of them first generate atoms and then add chemical bonds based on the generated atoms in a post-processing manner. However, there might be no corresponding bond solution for the temporally generated atoms as their locations are generated without considering potential bonds. We define this problem as the atom-bond inconsistency problem and claim it is the main reason for current approaches to generating unrealistic 3D molecules. To overcome this problem, we propose a new diffusion model called MolDiff which can generate atoms and bonds simultaneously while still maintaining their consistency by explicitly modeling the dependence between their relationships. We evaluated the generation ability of our proposed model and the quality of the generated molecules using criteria related to both geometry and chemical properties. The empirical studies showed that our model outperforms previous approaches, achieving a three-fold improvement in success rate and generating molecules with significantly better quality.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/peng23b	Xingang Peng, Jiaqi Guan, Qiang Liu, Jianzhu Ma
The Ideal Continual Learner: An Agent That Never Forgets	"The goal of continual learning is to find a model that solves multiple learning tasks which are presented sequentially to the learner. A key challenge in this setting is that the learner may ""forget"" how to solve a previous task when learning a new task, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, many practical methods have been proposed, including memory-based, regularization-based and expansion-based methods. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of these methods remains elusive. This paper aims to bridge this gap between theory and practice by proposing a new continual learning framework called ""Ideal Continual Learner"" (ICL), which is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic forgetting by construction. We show that ICL unifies multiple well-established continual learning methods and gives new theoretical insights into the strengths and weaknesses of these methods. We also derive generalization bounds for ICL which allow us to theoretically quantify ""how rehearsal affects generalization"". Finally, we connect ICL to several classic subjects and research topics of modern interest, which allows us to make historical remarks and inspire future directions."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/peng23a	Liangzu Peng, Paris Giampouras, Rene Vidal
Fair Neighbor Embedding	We consider fairness in dimensionality reduction. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction yields low dimensional representations that let users visualize and explore high-dimensional data. However, traditional dimensionality reduction may yield biased visualizations overemphasizing relationships of societal phenomena to sensitive attributes or protected groups. We introduce a framework of fair neighbor embedding, the Fair Neighbor Retrieval Visualizer, which formulates fair nonlinear dimensionality reduction as an information retrieval task whose performance and fairness are quantified by information retrieval criteria. The method optimizes low-dimensional embeddings that preserve high-dimensional data neighborhoods without yielding biased association of such neighborhoods to protected groups. In experiments the method yields fair visualizations outperforming previous methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/peltonen23a	Jaakko Peltonen, Wen Xu, Timo Nummenmaa, Jyrki Nummenmaa
Feature Directions Matter: Long-Tailed Learning via Rotated Balanced Representation	Long-tailed learning is one of the most challenging problems in visual recognition. There are some studies aiming to solve long-tailed classification from the perspective of feature learning. Recent work proposes to learn the balanced representation by fixing the linear classifier as Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF), since they argue what matters in classification is the structure of the feature, instead of their directions. Holding a different view, in this paper, we show that features with fixed directions may be harmful to the generalization of models, even if it is completely symmetric. To avoid this issue, we propose Representation-Balanced Learning Framework (RBL), which introduces orthogonal matrices to learn directions while maintaining the geometric structure of ETF. Theoretically, our contributions are two-fold: 1). we point out that the feature learning of RBL is insensitive toward training set label distribution, it always learns a balanced representation space. 2). we provide a generalization analysis of proposed RBL through training stability. To analyze the stability of the parameter with orthogonal constraint, we propose a novel training stability analysis paradigm, Two-Parameter Model Stability. Practically, our method is extremely simple in implementation but shows great superiority on several benchmark datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/peifeng23a	Gao Peifeng, Qianqian Xu, Peisong Wen, Zhiyong Yang, Huiyang Shao, Qingming Huang
Dynamics-inspired Neuromorphic Visual Representation Learning	This paper investigates the dynamics-inspired neuromorphic architecture for visual representation learning following Hamilton's principle. Our method converts weight-based neural structure to its dynamics-based form that consists of finite sub-models, whose mutual relations measured by computing path integrals amongst their dynamical states are equivalent to the typical neural weights. Based on the entropy reduction process derived from the Euler-Lagrange equations, the feedback signals interpreted as stress forces amongst sub-models push them to move. We first train a dynamics-based neural model from scratch and observe that this model outperforms traditional neural models on MNIST. We then convert several pre-trained neural structures into dynamics-based forms, followed by fine-tuning via entropy reduction to obtain the stabilized dynamical states. We observe consistent improvements in these transformed models over their weight-based counterparts on ImageNet and WebVision in terms of computational complexity, parameter size, testing accuracy, and robustness. Besides, we show the correlation between model performance and structural entropy, providing deeper insight into weight-free neuromorphic learning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/pei23b	Zhengqi Pei, Shuhui Wang
Can Large Language Models Reason about Program Invariants?	Identifying invariants is an important program analysis task with applications towards program understanding, bug finding, vulnerability analysis, and formal verification. Existing tools for identifying program invariants rely on dynamic analysis, requiring traces collected from multiple executions in order to produce reliable invariants. We study the application of large language models to invariant prediction, finding that models trained on source code and fine-tuned for invariant generation can perform invariant prediction as static rather than dynamic analysis. Using a scratchpad approach where invariants are predicted sequentially through a program gives the best performance, finding invariants statically of quality comparable to those obtained by a dynamic analysis tool with access to five program traces.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/pei23a	Kexin Pei, David Bieber, Kensen Shi, Charles Sutton, Pengcheng Yin
How Jellyfish Characterise Alternating Group Equivariant Neural Networks	We provide a full characterisation of all of the possible alternating group ($A_n$) equivariant neural networks whose layers are some tensor power of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. In particular, we find a basis of matrices for the learnable, linear, $A_n$–equivariant layer functions between such tensor power spaces in the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. We also describe how our approach generalises to the construction of neural networks that are equivariant to local symmetries.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/pearce-crump23b	Edward Pearce-Crump
Brauer’s Group Equivariant Neural Networks	We provide a full characterisation of all of the possible group equivariant neural networks whose layers are some tensor power of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for three symmetry groups that are missing from the machine learning literature: $O(n)$, the orthogonal group; $SO(n)$, the special orthogonal group; and $Sp(n)$, the symplectic group. In particular, we find a spanning set of matrices for the learnable, linear, equivariant layer functions between such tensor power spaces in the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ when the group is $O(n)$ or $SO(n)$, and in the symplectic basis of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ when the group is $Sp(n)$.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/pearce-crump23a	Edward Pearce-Crump

Reducing SO(3) Convolutions to SO(2) for Efficient Equivariant GNNs	Graph neural networks that model 3D data, such as point clouds or atoms, are typically desired to be $SO(3)$ equivariant, i.e., equivariant to 3D rotations. Unfortunately equivariant convolutions, which are a fundamental operation for equivariant networks, increase significantly in computational complexity as higher-order tensors are used. In this paper, we address this issue by reducing the $SO(3)$ convolutions or tensor products to mathematically equivalent convolutions in $SO(2)$ . This is accomplished by aligning the node embeddings' primary axis with the edge vectors, which sparsifies the tensor product and reduces the computational complexity from $O(L^6)$ to $O(L^3)$, where $L$ is the degree of the representation. We demonstrate the potential implications of this improvement by proposing the Equivariant Spherical Channel Network (eSCN), a graph neural network utilizing our novel approach to equivariant convolutions, which achieves state-of-the-art results on the large-scale OC-20 and OC-22 datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/passaro23a	Saro Passaro, C.

Stochastic Gradient Descent-Induced Drift of Representation in a Two-Layer Neural Network	Representational drift refers to over-time changes in neural activation accompanied by a stable task performance. Despite being observed in the brain and in artificial networks, the mechanisms of drift and its implications are not fully understood. Motivated by recent experimental findings of stimulus-dependent drift in the piriform cortex, we use theory and simulations to study this phenomenon in a two-layer linear feedforward network. Specifically, in a continual online learning scenario, we study the drift induced by the noise inherent in the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). By decomposing the learning dynamics into the normal and tangent spaces of the minimum-loss manifold, we show the former corresponds to a finite variance fluctuation, while the latter could be considered as an effective diffusion process on the manifold. We analytically compute the fluctuation and the diffusion coefficients for the stimuli representations in the hidden layer as functions of network parameters and input distribution. Further, consistent with experiments, we show that the drift rate is slower for a more frequently presented stimulus. Overall, our analysis yields a theoretical framework for better understanding of the drift phenomenon in biological and artificial neural networks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/pashakhanloo23a	Farhad Pashakhanloo, Alexei Koulakov
PAC Generalization via Invariant Representations	Invariant representations are transformations of the covariates such that the best model on top of the representation is invariant across training environments.

Model-based Reinforcement Learning with Scalable Composite Policy Gradient Estimators	In model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), policy gradients can be estimated either by derivative-free RL methods, such as likelihood ratio gradients (LR), or by backpropagating through a differentiable model via reparameterization gradients (RP). Instead of using one or the other, the Total Propagation (TP) algorithm in prior work showed that a combination of LR and RP estimators averaged using inverse variance weighting (IVW) can achieve orders of magnitude improvement over either method. However, IVW-based composite estimators have not yet been applied in modern RL tasks, as it is unclear if they can be implemented scalably. We propose a scalable method, Total Propagation X (TPX) that improves over TP by changing the node used for IVW, and employing coordinate wise weighting. We demonstrate the scalability of TPX by applying it to the state of the art visual MBRL algorithm Dreamer. The experiments showed that Dreamer fails with long simulation horizons, while our TPX works reliably for only a fraction of additional computation. One key advantage of TPX is its ease of implementation, which will enable experimenting with IVW on many tasks beyond MBRL.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/parmas23a	Paavo Parmas, Takuma Seno, Yuma Aoki
Accelerated Infeasibility Detection of Constrained Optimization and Fixed-Point Iterations	As first-order optimization methods become the method of choice for solving large-scale optimization problems, optimization solvers based on first-order algorithms are being built. Such general-purpose solvers must robustly detect infeasible or misspecified problem instances, but the computational complexity of first-order methods for doing so has yet to be formally studied. In this work, we characterize the optimal accelerated rate of infeasibility detection. We show that the standard fixed-point iteration achieves a $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ and $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ rates, respectively, on the normalized iterates and the fixed-point residual converging to the infimal displacement vector, while the accelerated fixed-point iteration achieves $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/k^2)$ rates. We then provide a matching complexity lower bound to establish that $\Theta(1/k^2)$ is indeed the optimal accelerated rate.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/park23k	Jisun Park, Ernest K. Ryu
Neural Stochastic Differential Games for Time-series Analysis	Modeling spatiotemporal dynamics with neural differential equations has become a major line of research that opens new ways to handle various real-world scenarios (e.g., missing observations, irregular times, etc.). Despite such progress, most existing methods still face challenges in providing a general framework for analyzing time series. To tackle this, we adopt stochastic differential games to suggest a new philosophy of utilizing interacting collective intelligence in time series analysis. For the implementation, we develop the novel gradient descent-based algorithm called deep neural fictitious play to approximate the Nash equilibrium. We theoretically analyze the convergence result of the proposed algorithm and discuss the advantage of cooperative games in handling noninformative observation. Throughout the experiments on various datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our framework over all the tested benchmarks in modeling time-series prediction by capitalizing on the advantages of applying cooperative games. An ablation study shows that neural agents of the proposed framework learn intrinsic temporal relevance to make accurate time-series predictions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/park23j	Sungwoo Park, Byoungwoo Park, Moontae Lee, Changhee Lee
Predictable MDP Abstraction for Unsupervised Model-Based RL	A key component of model-based reinforcement learning (RL) is a dynamics model that predicts the outcomes of actions. Errors in this predictive model can degrade the performance of model-based controllers, and complex Markov decision processes (MDPs) can present exceptionally difficult prediction problems. To mitigate this issue, we propose predictable MDP abstraction (PMA): instead of training a predictive model on the original MDP, we train a model on a transformed MDP with a learned action space that only permits predictable, easy-to-model actions, while covering the original state-action space as much as possible. As a result, model learning becomes easier and more accurate, which allows robust, stable model-based planning or model-based RL. This transformation is learned in an unsupervised manner, before any task is specified by the user. Downstream tasks can then be solved with model-based control in a zero-shot fashion, without additional environment interactions. We theoretically analyze PMA and empirically demonstrate that PMA leads to significant improvements over prior unsupervised model-based RL approaches in a range of benchmark environments.

Controllability-Aware Unsupervised Skill Discovery	One of the key capabilities of intelligent agents is the ability to discover useful skills without external supervision. However, the current unsupervised skill discovery methods are often limited to acquiring simple, easy-to-learn skills due to the lack of incentives to discover more complex, challenging behaviors. We introduce a novel unsupervised skill discovery method, Controllability-aware Skill Discovery (CSD), which actively seeks complex, hard-to-control skills without supervision. The key component of CSD is a controllability-aware distance function, which assigns larger values to state transitions that are harder to achieve with the current skills. Combined with distance-maximizing skill discovery, CSD progressively learns more challenging skills over the course of training as our jointly trained distance function reduces rewards for easy-to-achieve skills. Our experimental results in six robotic manipulation and locomotion environments demonstrate that CSD can discover diverse complex skills including object manipulation and locomotion skills with no supervision, significantly outperforming prior unsupervised skill discovery methods.

Differentially Private Sharpness-Aware Training	Training deep learning models with differential privacy (DP) results in a degradation of performance. The training dynamics of models with DP show a significant difference from standard training, whereas understanding the geometric properties of private learning remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate sharpness, a key factor in achieving better generalization, in private learning. We show that flat minima can help reduce the negative effects of per-example gradient clipping and the addition of Gaussian noise. We then verify the effectiveness of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) for seeking flat minima in private learning. However, we also discover that SAM is detrimental to the privacy budget and computational time due to its two-step optimization. Thus, we propose a new sharpness-aware training method that mitigates the privacy-optimization trade-off. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance of deep learning models with DP from both scratch and fine-tuning.

Learning Controllable Degradation for Real-World Super-Resolution via Constrained Flows	Recent deep-learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been successful in recovering high-resolution (HR) images from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts, albeit on the synthetic and simple degradation setting: bicubic downscaling. On the other hand, super-resolution on real-world images demands the capability to handle complex downscaling mechanism which produces different artifacts (e.g., noise, blur, color distortion) upon downscaling factors. To account for complex downscaling mechanism in real-world LR images, there have been a few efforts in constructing datasets consisting of LR images with real-world downsampling degradation. However, making such datasets entails a tremendous amount of time and effort, thereby resorting to very few number of downscaling factors (e.g., $\times$2, $\times$3, $\times$4). To remedy the issue, we propose to generate realistic SR datasets for unseen degradation levels by exploring the latent space of real LR images and thereby producing more diverse yet realistic LR images with complex real-world artifacts. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the generated LR images, and we show that the various conventional SR networks trained with our newly generated SR datasets can produce much better HR images.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/park23f	Seobin Park, Dongjin Kim, Sungyong Baik, Tae Hyun Kim
Towards Understanding Ensemble Distillation in Federated Learning	Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning paradigm for data privacy preservation. Recently, a knowledge distillation (KD) based information sharing approach in FL, which conducts ensemble distillation on an unlabeled public dataset, has been proposed. However, despite its experimental success and usefulness, the theoretical analysis of the KD based approach has not been satisfactorily conducted. In this work, we build a theoretical foundation of the ensemble distillation framework in federated learning from the perspective of kernel ridge regression (KRR). In this end, we propose a KD based FL algorithm for KRR models which is related with some existing KD based FL algorithms, and analyze our algorithm theoretically. We show that our algorithm makes local prediction models as much powerful as the centralized KRR model (which is a KRR model trained by all of local datasets) in terms of the convergence rate of the generalization error if the unlabeled public dataset is sufficiently large. We also provide experimental results to verify our theoretical results on ensemble distillation in federated learning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/park23e	Sejun Park, Kihun Hong, Ganguk Hwang
Test-Time Style Shifting: Handling Arbitrary Styles in Domain Generalization	In domain generalization (DG), the target domain is unknown when the model is being trained, and the trained model should successfully work on an arbitrary (and possibly unseen) target domain during inference. This is a difficult problem, and despite active studies in recent years, it remains a great challenge. In this paper, we take a simple yet effective approach to tackle this issue. We propose test-time style shifting, which shifts the style of the test sample (that has a large style gap with the source domains) to the nearest source domain that the model is already familiar with, before making the prediction. This strategy enables the model to handle any target domains with arbitrary style statistics, without additional model update at test-time. Additionally, we propose style balancing, which provides a great platform for maximizing the advantage of test-time style shifting by handling the DG-specific imbalance issues. The proposed ideas are easy to implement and successfully work in conjunction with various other DG schemes. Experimental results on different datasets show the effectiveness of our methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/park23d	Jungwuk Park, Dong-Jun Han, Soyeong Kim, Jaekyun Moon

Learning Affinity with Hyperbolic Representation for Spatial Propagation	Recent approaches to representation learning have successfully demonstrated the benefits in hyperbolic space, driven by an excellent ability to make hierarchical relationships. In this work, we demonstrate that the properties of hyperbolic geometry serve as a valuable alternative to learning hierarchical affinity for spatial propagation tasks. We propose a Hyperbolic Affinity learning Module (HAM) to learn spatial affinity by considering geodesic distance on the hyperbolic space. By simply incorporating our HAM into conventional spatial propagation tasks, we validate its effectiveness, capturing the pixel hierarchy of affinity maps in hyperbolic space. The proposed methodology can lead to performance improvements in explicit propagation processes such as depth completion and semantic segmentation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/park23b	Jin-Hwi Park, Jaesung Choe, Inhwan Bae, Hae-Gon Jeon
Kernel Sufficient Dimension Reduction and Variable Selection for Compositional Data via Amalgamation	Compositional data with a large number of components and an abundance of zeros are frequently observed in many fields recently. Analyzing such sparse high-dimensional compositional data naturally calls for dimension reduction or, more preferably, variable selection. Most existing approaches lack interpretability or cannot handle zeros properly, as they rely on a log-ratio transformation. We approach this problem with sufficient dimension reduction (SDR), one of the most studied dimension reduction frameworks in statistics. Characterized by the conditional independence of the data to the response on the found subspace, the SDR framework has been effective for both linear and nonlinear dimension reduction problems. This work proposes a compositional SDR that can handle zeros naturally while incorporating the nonlinear nature and spurious negative correlations among components rigorously. A critical consideration of sub-composition versus amalgamation for compositional variable selection is discussed. The proposed compositional SDR is shown to be statistically consistent in constructing a sub-simplex consisting of true signal variables. Simulation and real microbiome data are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed SDR compared to existing state-of-art approaches.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/park23a	Junyoung Park, Jeongyoun Ahn, Cheolwoo Park

Secure Federated Correlation Test and Entropy Estimation	We propose the first federated correlation test framework compatible with secure aggregation, namely FED-$\chi^2$. In our protocol, the statistical computations are recast as frequency moment estimation problems, where the clients collaboratively generate a shared projection matrix and then use stable projection to encode the local information in a compact vector. As such encodings can be linearly aggregated, secure aggregation can be applied to conceal the individual updates. We formally establish the security guarantee of FED-$\chi^2$ by proving that only the minimum necessary information (i.e., the correlation statistics) is revealed to the server. We show that our protocol can be naturally extended to estimate other statistics that can be recast as frequency moment estimations. By accommodating Shannon'e Entropy in FED-$\chi^2$, we further propose the first secure federated entropy estimation protocol, FED-$H$. The evaluation results demonstrate that FED-$\chi^2$ and FED-$H$ achieve good performance with small client-side computation overhead in several real-world case studies.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/pang23a	Qi Pang, Lun Wang, Shuai Wang, Wenting Zheng, Dawn Song
Learn to Accumulate Evidence from All Training Samples: Theory and Practice	Evidential deep learning, built upon belief theory and subjective logic, offers a principled and computationally efficient way to turn a deterministic neural network uncertainty-aware. The resultant evidential models can quantify fine-grained uncertainty using the learned evidence. To ensure theoretically sound evidential models, the evidence needs to be non-negative, which requires special activation functions for model training and inference. This constraint often leads to inferior predictive performance compared to standard softmax models, making it challenging to extend them to many large-scale datasets. To unveil the real cause of this undesired behavior, we theoretically investigate evidential models and identify a fundamental limitation that explains the inferior performance: existing evidential activation functions create	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/pandey23a	Deep Shankar Pandey, Qi Yu
Flash: Concept Drift Adaptation in Federated Learning	In Federated Learning (FL), adaptive optimization is an effective approach to addressing the statistical heterogeneity issue but cannot adapt quickly to concept drifts. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive optimizer called Flash that simultaneously addresses both statistical heterogeneity and the concept drift issues. The fundamental insight is that a concept drift can be detected based on the magnitude of parameter updates that are required to fit the global model to each participating client's local data distribution. Flash uses a two-pronged approach that synergizes client-side early-stopping training to facilitate detection of concept drifts and the server-side drift-aware adaptive optimization to effectively adjust effective learning rate. We theoretically prove that Flash matches the convergence rate of state-of-the-art adaptive optimizers and further empirically evaluate the efficacy of Flash on a variety of FL benchmarks using different concept drift settings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/panchal23a	Kunjal Panchal, Sunav Choudhary, Subrata Mitra, Koyel Mukherjee, Somdeb Sarkhel, Saayan Mitra, Hui Guan
Semi Bandit dynamics in Congestion Games: Convergence to Nash Equilibrium and No-Regret Guarantees.	In this work, we propose introduce a variant of online stochastic gradient descent and prove it converges to Nash equilibria and simultaneously it has sublinear regret for the class of congestion games in the semi-bandit feedback setting. Our proposed method admits convergence rates depending only polynomially on the number of players and the number of facilities, but not on the size of the action set, which can be exponentially large in terms of the number of facilities. Moreover, the running time of our method has polynomial-time dependence on the implicit description of the game. Our analysis exploits techniques from convex geometry, in particular Caratheodory's theorem and recent advances in non-convex stochastic optimization. This work improves upon and answers an open question from (Cui et al 2022).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/panageas23a	Ioannis Panageas, Stratis Skoulakis, Luca Viano, Xiao Wang, Volkan Cevher
A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Approach based on the Hadamard Transform for the Convolutional Layer	In this paper, we propose a novel Hadamard Transform (HT)-based neural network layer for hybrid quantum-classical computing. It implements the regular convolutional layers in the Hadamard transform domain. The idea is based on the HT convolution theorem which states that the dyadic convolution between two vectors is equivalent to the element-wise multiplication of their HT representation. Computing the HT is simply the application of a Hadamard gate to each qubit individually, so the HT computations of our proposed layer can be implemented on a quantum computer. Compared to the regular Conv2D layer, the proposed HT-perceptron layer is computationally more efficient. Compared to a CNN with the same number of trainable parameters and 99.26% test accuracy, our HT network reaches 99.31% test accuracy with 57.1% MACs reduced in the MNIST dataset; and in our ImageNet-1K experiments, our HT-based ResNet-50 exceeds the accuracy of the baseline ResNet-50 by 0.59% center-crop top-1 accuracy using 11.5% fewer parameters with 12.6% fewer MACs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/pan23d	Hongyi Pan, Xin Zhu, Salih Furkan Atici, Ahmet Cetin
Better Training of GFlowNets with Local Credit and Incomplete Trajectories	Generative Flow Networks or GFlowNets are related to Monte-Carlo Markov chain methods (as they sample from a distribution specified by an energy function), reinforcement learning (as they learn a policy to sample composed objects through a sequence of steps), generative models (as they learn to represent and sample from a distribution) and amortized variational methods (as they can be used to learn to approximate and sample from an otherwise intractable posterior, given a prior and a likelihood). They are trained to generate an object $x$ through a sequence of steps with probability proportional to some reward function $R(x)$ (or $\exp(-\mathcal{E}(x))$ with $\mathcal{E}(x)$ denoting the energy function), given at the end of the generative trajectory. Like for other RL settings where the reward is only given at the end, the efficiency of training and credit assignment may suffer when those trajectories are longer. With previous GFlowNet work, no learning was possible from incomplete trajectories (lacking a terminal state and the computation of the associated reward). In this paper, we consider the case where the energy function can be applied not just to terminal states but also to intermediate states. This is for example achieved when the energy function is additive, with terms available along the trajectory. We show how to reparameterize the GFlowNet state flow function to take advantage of the partial reward already accrued at each state. This enables a training objective that can be applied to update parameters even with incomplete trajectories. Even when complete trajectories are available, being able to obtain more localized credit and gradients is found to speed up training convergence, as demonstrated across many simulations.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/pan23c	Ling Pan, Nikolay Malkin, Dinghuai Zhang, Yoshua Bengio
Beyond Homophily: Reconstructing Structure for Graph-agnostic Clustering	Graph neural networks (GNNs) based methods have achieved impressive performance on node clustering task. However, they are designed on the homophilic assumption of graph and clustering on heterophilic graph is overlooked. Due to the lack of labels, it is impossible to first identify a graph as homophilic or heterophilic before a suitable GNN model can be found. Hence, clustering on real-world graph with various levels of homophily poses a new challenge to the graph research community. To fill this gap, we propose a novel graph clustering method, which contains three key components: graph reconstruction, a mixed filter, and dual graph clustering network. To be graph-agnostic, we empirically construct two graphs which are high homophily and heterophily from each data. The mixed filter based on the new graphs extracts both low-frequency and high-frequency information. To reduce the adverse coupling between node attribute and topological structure, we separately map them into two subspaces in dual graph clustering network. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark graphs demonstrate our promising performance. In particular, our method dominates others on heterophilic graphs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/pan23b	Erlin Pan, Zhao Kang
Do the Rewards Justify the Means? Measuring Trade-Offs Between Rewards and Ethical Behavior in the Machiavelli Benchmark	Artificial agents have traditionally been trained to maximize reward, which may incentivize power-seeking and deception, analogous to how next-token prediction in language models (LMs) may incentivize toxicity. So do agents naturally learn to be Machiavellian? And how do we measure these behaviors in general-purpose models such as GPT-4? Towards answering these questions, we introduce Machiavelli, a benchmark of 134 Choose-Your-Own-Adventure games containing over half a million rich, diverse scenarios that center on social decision-making. Scenario labeling is automated with LMs, which are more performant than human annotators. We mathematize dozens of harmful behaviors and use our annotations to evaluate agents' tendencies to be power-seeking, cause disutility, and commit ethical violations. We observe some tension between maximizing reward and behaving ethically. To improve this trade-off, we investigate LM-based methods to steer agents towards less harmful behaviors. Our results show that agents can both act competently and morally, so concrete progress can currently be made in machine ethics–designing agents that are Pareto improvements in both safety and capabilities.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/pan23a	Alexander Pan, Jun Shern Chan, Andy Zou, Nathaniel Li, Steven Basart, Thomas Woodside, Hanlin Zhang, Scott Emmons, Dan Hendrycks
Controlled Differential Equations on Long Sequences via Non-standard Wavelets	"Neural Controlled Differential equations (NCDE) are a powerful mechanism to model the dynamics in temporal sequences, e.g., applications involving physiological measures, where apart from the initial condition, the dynamics also depend on subsequent measures or even a different ""control"" sequence. But NCDEs do not scale well to longer sequences. Existing strategies adapt rough path theory, and instead model the dynamics over summaries known as log signatures. While rigorous and elegant, invertibility of these summaries is difficult, and limits the scope of problems where these ideas can offer strong benefits (reconstruction, generative modeling). For tasks where it is sensible to assume that the (long) sequences in the training data are a fixed length of temporal measurements – this assumption holds in most experiments tackled in the literature – we describe an efficient simplification. First, we recast the regression/classification task as an integral transform. We then show how restricting the class of operators (permissible in the integral transform), allows the use of a known algorithm that leverages non-standard Wavelets to decompose the operator. Thereby, our task (learning the operator) radically simplifies. A neural variant of this idea yields consistent improvements across a wide gamut of use cases tackled in existing works. We also describe a novel application on modeling tasks involving coupled differential equations."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/pal23b	Sourav Pal, Zhanpeng Zeng, Sathya N. Ravi, Vikas Singh
Locally Regularized Neural Differential Equations: Some Black Boxes were meant to remain closed!	Neural Differential Equations have become an important modeling framework due to their ability to adapt to new problems automatically. Training a neural differential equation is effectively a search over a space of plausible dynamical systems. Controlling the computational cost for these models is difficult since it relies on the number of steps the adaptive solver takes. Most prior works have used higher-order methods to reduce prediction timings while greatly increasing training time or reducing both training and prediction timings by relying on specific training algorithms, which are harder to use as a drop-in replacement.

Extrapolative Controlled Sequence Generation via Iterative Refinement	We study the problem of extrapolative controlled generation, i.e., generating sequences with attribute values beyond the range seen in training. This task is of significant importance in automated design, especially drug discovery, where the goal is to design novel proteins that are better (e.g., more stable) than existing sequences. Thus, by definition the target sequences and their attribute values are out of the training distribution, posing challenges to existing methods that aim to directly generate the target sequence. Instead, in this work, we propose Iterative Controlled Extrapolation (ICE) which iteratively makes local edits to a sequence to enable extrapolation. We train the model on synthetically generated sequence pairs that demonstrate small improvement in the attribute value. Results on one natural language task (sentiment analysis) and two protein engineering tasks (ACE2 stability and AAV fitness) show that ICE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches despite its simplicity.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/padmakumar23a	Vishakh Padmakumar, Richard Yuanzhe Pang, He He, Ankur P Parikh
Revisiting the Linear-Programming Framework for Offline RL with General Function Approximation	Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find an optimal policy for sequential decision-making using a pre-collected dataset, without further interaction with the environment. Recent theoretical progress has focused on developing sample-efficient offline RL algorithms with various relaxed assumptions on data coverage and function approximators, especially to handle the case with excessively large state-action spaces. Among them, the framework based on the linear-programming (LP) reformulation of Markov decision processes has shown promise: it enables sample-efficient offline RL with function approximation, under only partial data coverage and realizability assumptions on the function classes, with favorable computational tractability. In this work, we revisit the LP framework for offline RL, and provide a new reformulation that advances the existing results in several aspects, relaxing certain assumptions and achieving optimal statistical rates in terms of sample size. Our key enabler is to introduce proper constraints in the reformulation, instead of using any regularization as in the literature, also with careful choices of the function classes and initial state distributions. We hope our insights bring into light the use of LP formulations and the induced primal-dual minimax optimization, in offline RL.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ozdaglar23a	Asuman E.

On the Role of Attention in Prompt-tuning	Prompt-tuning is an emerging strategy to adapt large language models (LLM) to downstream tasks by learning a (soft-)prompt parameter from data. Despite its success in LLMs, there is limited theoretical understanding of the power of prompt-tuning and the role of the attention mechanism in prompting. In this work, we explore prompt-tuning for one-layer attention architectures and study contextual mixture-models where each input token belongs to a context-relevant or -irrelevant set. We isolate the role of prompt-tuning through a self-contained prompt-attention model. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We show that softmax-prompt-attention is provably more expressive than softmax-self-attention and linear-prompt-attention under our contextual data model. (2) We analyze the initial trajectory of gradient descent and show that it learns the prompt and prediction head with near-optimal sample complexity and demonstrate how the prompt can provably attend to sparse context-relevant tokens. (3) Assuming a known prompt but an unknown prediction head, we characterize the exact finite sample performance of prompt-attention which reveals the fundamental performance limits and the precise benefit of the context information. We also provide experiments that verify our theoretical insights on real datasets and demonstrate how prompt-tuning enables the model to attend to context-relevant information.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/oymak23a	Samet Oymak, Ankit Singh Rawat, Mahdi Soltanolkotabi, Christos Thrampoulidis
Improving Adversarial Robustness Through the Contrastive-Guided Diffusion Process	Synthetic data generation has become an emerging tool to help improve the adversarial robustness in classification tasks, since robust learning requires a significantly larger amount of training samples compared with standard classification. Among various deep generative models, the diffusion model has been shown to produce high-quality synthetic images and has achieved good performance in improving the adversarial robustness. However, diffusion-type methods are generally slower in data generation as compared with other generative models. Although different acceleration techniques have been proposed recently, it is also of great importance to study how to improve the sample efficiency of synthetic data for the downstream task. In this paper, we first analyze the optimality condition of synthetic distribution for achieving improved robust accuracy. We show that enhancing the distinguishability among the generated data is critical for improving adversarial robustness. Thus, we propose the Contrastive-Guided Diffusion Process (Contrastive-DP), which incorporates the contrastive loss to guide the diffusion model in data generation. We validate our theoretical results using simulations and demonstrate the good performance of Contrastive-DP on image datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ouyang23a	Yidong Ouyang, Liyan Xie, Guang Cheng
Resurrecting Recurrent Neural Networks for Long Sequences	Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) offer fast inference on long sequences but are hard to optimize and slow to train. Deep state-space models (SSMs) have recently been shown to perform remarkably well on long sequence modeling tasks, and have the added benefits of fast parallelizable training and RNN-like fast inference. However, while SSMs are superficially similar to RNNs, there are important differences that make it unclear where their performance boost over RNNs comes from. We show that careful design of deep RNNs using standard signal propagation arguments can recover the impressive performance of deep SSMs on long-range reasoning tasks, while matching their training speed. To achieve this, we analyze and ablate a series of changes to standard RNNs including linearizing and diagonalizing the recurrence, using better parameterizations and initializations, and ensuring careful normalization of the forward pass. Our results provide new insights on the origins of the impressive performance of deep SSMs, and introduce an RNN block called the Linear Recurrent Unit (or LRU) that matches both their performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark and their computational efficiency.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/orvieto23a	Antonio Orvieto, Samuel L Smith, Albert Gu, Anushan Fernando, Caglar Gulcehre, Razvan Pascanu, Soham De
When does Privileged information Explain Away Label Noise?	Leveraging privileged information (PI), or features available during training but not at test time, has recently been shown to be an effective method for addressing label noise. However, the reasons for its effectiveness are not well understood. In this study, we investigate the role played by different properties of the PI in explaining away label noise. Through experiments on multiple datasets with real PI (CIFAR-N/H) and a new large-scale benchmark ImageNet-PI, we find that PI is most helpful when it allows networks to easily distinguish clean from noisy data, while enabling a learning shortcut to memorize the noisy examples. Interestingly, when PI becomes too predictive of the target label, PI methods often perform worse than their no-PI baselines. Based on these findings, we propose several enhancements to the state-of-the-art PI methods and demonstrate the potential of PI as a means of tackling label noise. Finally, we show how we can easily combine the resulting PI approaches with existing no-PI techniques designed to deal with label noise.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ortiz-jimenez23a	Guillermo Ortiz-Jimenez, Mark Collier, Anant Nawalgaria, Alexander Nicholas D’Amour, Jesse Berent, Rodolphe Jenatton, Efi Kokiopoulou
Measuring the Impact of Programming Language Distribution	Current benchmarks for evaluating neural code models focus on only a small subset of programming languages, excluding many popular languages such as Go or Rust. To ameliorate this issue, we present the BabelCode framework for execution-based evaluation of any benchmark in any language. BabelCode enables new investigations into the qualitative performance of models' memory, runtime, and individual test case results. Additionally, we present a new code translation dataset called Translating Python Programming Puzzles (TP3) from the Python Programming Puzzles (Schuster et al., 2021) benchmark that involves translating expert-level python functions to any language. With both BabelCode and the TP3 benchmark, we investigate if balancing the distributions of 14 languages in a training dataset improves a large language model's performance on low-resource languages. Training a model on a balanced corpus results in, on average, 12.34% higher $pass@k$ across all tasks and languages compared to the baseline. We find that this strategy achieves 66.48% better $pass@k$ on low-resource languages at the cost of only a 12.94% decrease to high-resource languages. In our three translation tasks, this strategy yields, on average, 30.77% better low-resource $pass@k$ while having 19.58% worse high-resource $pass@k$.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/orlanski23a	Gabriel Orlanski, Kefan Xiao, Xavier Garcia, Jeffrey Hui, Joshua Howland, Jonathan Malmaud, Jacob Austin, Rishabh Singh, Michele Catasta
B-Learner: Quasi-Oracle Bounds on Heterogeneous Causal Effects Under Hidden Confounding	Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects from observational data is a crucial task across many fields, helping policy and decision-makers take better actions. There has been recent progress on robust and efficient methods for estimating the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) function, but these methods often do not take into account the risk of hidden confounding, which could arbitrarily and unknowingly bias any causal estimate based on observational data. We propose a meta-learner called the B-Learner, which can efficiently learn sharp bounds on the CATE function under limits on the level of hidden confounding. We derive the B-Learner by adapting recent results for sharp and valid bounds of the average treatment effect (Dorn et al., 2021) into the framework given by Kallus & Oprescu (2023) for robust and model-agnostic learning of conditional distributional treatment effects. The B-Learner can use any function estimator such as random forests and deep neural networks, and we prove its estimates are valid, sharp, efficient, and have a quasi-oracle property with respect to the constituent estimators under more general conditions than existing methods. Semi-synthetic experimental comparisons validate the theoretical findings, and we use real-world data demonstrate how the method might be used in practice.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/oprescu23a	Miruna Oprescu, Jacob Dorn, Marah Ghoummaid, Andrew Jesson, Nathan Kallus, Uri Shalit
How Many Perturbations Break This Model? Evaluating Robustness Beyond Adversarial Accuracy	Robustness to adversarial attacks is typically evaluated with adversarial accuracy. While essential, this metric does not capture all aspects of robustness and in particular leaves out the question of how many perturbations can be found for each point. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach, adversarial sparsity, which quantifies how difficult it is to find a successful perturbation given both an input point and a constraint on the direction of the perturbation. We show that sparsity provides valuable insight into neural networks in multiple ways: for instance, it illustrates important differences between current state-of-the-art robust models them that accuracy analysis does not, and suggests approaches for improving their robustness. When applying broken defenses effective against weak attacks but not strong ones, sparsity can discriminate between the totally ineffective and the partially effective defenses. Finally, with sparsity we can measure increases in robustness that do not affect accuracy: we show for example that data augmentation can by itself increase adversarial robustness, without using adversarial training.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/olivier23a	Raphael Olivier, Bhiksha Raj
Diffusion Models are Minimax Optimal Distribution Estimators	While efficient distribution learning is no doubt behind the groundbreaking success of diffusion modeling, its theoretical guarantees are quite limited. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous analysis on approximation and generalization abilities of diffusion modeling for well-known function spaces. The highlight of this paper is that when the true density function belongs to the Besov space and the empirical score matching loss is properly minimized, the generated data distribution achieves the nearly minimax optimal estimation rates in the total variation distance and in the Wasserstein distance of order one. Furthermore, we extend our theory to demonstrate how diffusion models adapt to low-dimensional data distributions. We expect these results advance theoretical understandings of diffusion modeling and its ability to generate verisimilar outputs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/oko23a	Kazusato Oko, Shunta Akiyama, Taiji Suzuki
On the Within-Group Fairness of Screening Classifiers	Screening classifiers are increasingly used to identify qualified candidates in a variety of selection processes. In this context, it has been recently shown that if a classifier is calibrated, one can identify the smallest set of candidates which contains, in expectation, a desired number of qualified candidates using a threshold decision rule. This lends support to focusing on calibration as the only requirement for screening classifiers. In this paper, we argue that screening policies that use calibrated classifiers may suffer from an understudied type of within-group unfairness—they may unfairly treat qualified members within demographic groups of interest. Further, we argue that this type of unfairness can be avoided if classifiers satisfy within-group monotonicity, a natural monotonicity property within each group. Then, we introduce an efficient post-processing algorithm based on dynamic programming to minimally modify a given calibrated classifier so that its probability estimates satisfy within-group monotonicity. We validate our algorithm using US Census survey data and show that within-group monotonicity can often be achieved at a small cost in terms of prediction granularity and shortlist size.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/okati23a	Nastaran Okati, Stratis Tsirtsis, Manuel Gomez Rodriguez
Reasons for the Superiority of Stochastic Estimators over Deterministic Ones: Robustness, Consistency and Perceptual Quality	Stochastic restoration algorithms allow to explore the space of solutions that correspond to the degraded input. In this paper we reveal additional fundamental advantages of stochastic methods over deterministic ones, which further motivate their use. First, we prove that any restoration algorithm that attains perfect perceptual quality and whose outputs are consistent with the input must be a posterior sampler, and is thus required to be stochastic. Second, we illustrate that while deterministic restoration algorithms may attain high perceptual quality, this can be achieved only by filling up the space of all possible source images using an extremely sensitive mapping, which makes them highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Indeed, we show that enforcing deterministic models to be robust to such attacks profoundly hinders their perceptual quality, while robustifying stochastic models hardly influences their perceptual quality, and improves their output variability. These findings provide a motivation to foster progress in stochastic restoration methods, paving the way to better recovery algorithms.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ohayon23a	Guy Ohayon, Theo Joseph Adrai, Michael Elad, Tomer Michaeli
Shedding a PAC-Bayesian Light on Adaptive Sliced-Wasserstein Distances	The Sliced-Wasserstein distance (SW) is a computationally efficient and theoretically grounded alternative to the Wasserstein distance. Yet, the literature on its statistical properties – or, more accurately, its generalization properties – with respect to the distribution of slices, beyond the uniform measure, is scarce. To bring new contributions to this line of research, we leverage the PAC-Bayesian theory and a central observation that SW may be interpreted as an average risk, the quantity PAC-Bayesian bounds have been designed to characterize. We provide three types of results: i) PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds that hold on what we refer as adaptive Sliced-Wasserstein distances, i.e. SW defined with respect to arbitrary distributions of slices (among which data-dependent distributions), ii) a principled procedure to learn the distribution of slices that yields maximally discriminative SW, by optimizing our theoretical bounds, and iii) empirical illustrations of our theoretical findings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ohana23a	Ruben Ohana, Kimia Nadjahi, Alain Rakotomamonjy, Liva Ralaivola
Provable Benefit of Mixup for Finding Optimal Decision Boundaries	We investigate how pair-wise data augmentation techniques like Mixup affect the sample complexity of finding optimal decision boundaries in a binary linear classification problem. For a family of data distributions with a separability constant $\kappa$, we analyze how well the optimal classifier in terms of training loss aligns with the optimal one in test accuracy (i.e., Bayes optimal classifier). For vanilla training without augmentation, we uncover an interesting phenomenon named the curse of separability. As we increase $\kappa$ to make the data distribution more separable, the sample complexity of vanilla training increases exponentially in $\kappa$; perhaps surprisingly, the task of finding optimal decision boundaries becomes harder for more separable distributions. For Mixup training, we show that Mixup mitigates this problem by significantly reducing the sample complexity. To this end, we develop new concentration results applicable to $n^2$ pair-wise augmented data points constructed from $n$ independent data, by carefully dealing with dependencies between overlapping pairs. Lastly, we study other masking-based Mixup-style techniques and show that they can distort the training loss and make its minimizer converge to a suboptimal classifier in terms of test accuracy.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/oh23a	Junsoo Oh, Chulhee Yun
Efficient Exploration via Epistemic-Risk-Seeking Policy Optimization	Exploration remains a key challenge in deep reinforcement learning (RL). Optimism in the face of uncertainty is a well-known heuristic with theoretical guarantees in the tabular setting, but how best to translate the principle to deep reinforcement learning, which involves online stochastic gradients and deep network function approximators, is not fully understood. In this paper we propose a new, differentiable optimistic objective that when optimized yields a policy that provably explores efficiently, with guarantees even under function approximation. Our new objective is a zero-sum two-player game derived from endowing the agent with an epistemic-risk-seeking utility function, which converts uncertainty into value and encourages the agent to explore uncertain states. We show that the solution to this game minimizes an upper bound on the regret, with the 'players' each attempting to minimize one component of a particular regret decomposition. We derive a new model-free algorithm which we call 'epistemic-risk-seeking actor-critic' (ERSAC), which is simply an application of simultaneous stochastic gradient ascent-descent to the game. Finally, we discuss a recipe for incorporating off-policy data and show that combining the risk-seeking objective with replay data yields a double benefit in terms of statistical efficiency. We conclude with some results showing good performance of a deep RL agent using the technique on the challenging 'DeepSea' environment, showing significant performance improvements even over other efficient exploration techniques, as well as improved performance on the Atari benchmark.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/o-donoghue23a	Brendan O’Donoghue
Few-bit Backward: Quantized Gradients of Activation Functions for Memory Footprint Reduction	Memory footprint is one of the main limiting factors for large neural network training. In backpropagation, one needs to store the input to each operation in the computational graph. Every modern neural network model has quite a few pointwise nonlinearities in its architecture, and such operations induce additional memory costs that, as we show, can be significantly reduced by quantization of the gradients. We propose a systematic approach to compute optimal quantization of the retained gradients of the pointwise nonlinear functions with only a few bits per each element. We show that such approximation can be achieved by computing an optimal piecewise-constant approximation of the derivative of the activation function, which can be done by dynamic programming. The drop-in replacements are implemented for all popular nonlinearities and can be used in any existing pipeline. We confirm the memory reduction and the same convergence on several open benchmarks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/novikov23a	Georgii Sergeevich Novikov, Daniel Bershatsky, Julia Gusak, Alex Shonenkov, Denis Valerievich Dimitrov, Ivan Oseledets
CHiLS: Zero-Shot Image Classification with Hierarchical Label Sets	Open vocabulary models (e.g. CLIP) have shown strong performance on zero-shot classification through their ability generate embeddings for each class based on their (natural language) names. Prior work has focused on improving the accuracy of these models through prompt engineering or by incorporating a small amount of labeled downstream data (via finetuning). However, there has been little focus on improving the richness of the class names themselves, which can pose issues when class labels are coarsely-defined and are uninformative. We propose Classification with Hierarchical Label Sets (or CHiLS), an alternative strategy for zero-shot classification specifically designed for datasets with implicit semantic hierarchies. CHiLS proceeds in three steps: (i) for each class, produce a set of subclasses, using either existing label hierarchies or by querying GPT-3; (ii) perform the standard zero-shot CLIP procedure as though these subclasses were the labels of interest; (iii) map the predicted subclass back to its parent to produce the final prediction. Across numerous datasets with underlying hierarchical structure, CHiLS leads to improved accuracy in situations both with and without ground-truth hierarchical information. CHiLS is simple to implement within existing zero-shot pipelines and requires no additional training cost.

Gradient-Free Structured Pruning with Unlabeled Data	Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved great success in solving difficult tasks across many domains, but such success comes with a high computation cost, and inference latency. As developers and third parties customize these models, the need to provide efficient inference has increased. Many efforts have attempted to reduce inference cost through model compression techniques such as pruning and distillation. However, these techniques either require labeled data, or are time-consuming as they require the compressed model to be retrained to regain accuracy. In this paper, we propose a gradient-free structured pruning framework that uses only unlabeled data. An evaluation on the GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks using BERT$_{BASE}$ and DistilBERT illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. By only using the weights of the pre-trained model and unlabeled data, in a matter of a few minutes on a single GPU, up to 40% of the original FLOP count can be reduced with less than a $4%$ accuracy loss across all tasks considered.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nova23a	Azade Nova, Hanjun Dai, Dale Schuurmans
Do Embodied Agents Dream of Pixelated Sheep: Embodied Decision Making using Language Guided World Modelling	Reinforcement learning (RL) agents typically learn tabula rasa, without prior knowledge of the world. However, if initialized with knowledge of high-level subgoals and transitions between subgoals, RL agents could utilize this Abstract World Model (AWM) for planning and exploration. We propose using few-shot large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize an AWM, that will be verified through world experience, to improve sample efficiency of RL agents. Our DECKARD agent applies LLM-guided exploration to item crafting in Minecraft in two phases: (1) the Dream phase where the agent uses an LLM to decompose a task into a sequence of subgoals, the hypothesized AWM; and (2) the Wake phase where the agent learns a modular policy for each subgoal and verifies or corrects the hypothesized AWM. Our method of hypothesizing an AWM with LLMs and then verifying the AWM based on agent experience not only increases sample efficiency over contemporary methods by an order of magnitude but is also robust to and corrects errors in the LLM, successfully blending noisy internet-scale information from LLMs with knowledge grounded in environment dynamics.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nottingham23a	Kolby Nottingham, Prithviraj Ammanabrolu, Alane Suhr, Yejin Choi, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Sameer Singh, Roy Fox

Primal and Dual Analysis of Entropic Fictitious Play for Finite-sum Problems	The entropic fictitious play (EFP) is a recently proposed algorithm that minimizes the sum of a convex functional and entropy in the space of measures — such an objective naturally arises in the optimization of a two-layer neural network in the mean-field regime. In this work, we provide a concise primal-dual analysis of EFP in the setting where the learning problem exhibits a finite-sum structure. We establish quantitative global convergence guarantees for both the continuous-time and discrete-time dynamics based on properties of a proximal Gibbs measure introduced in Nitanda et al. (2022). Furthermore, our primal-dual framework entails a memory-efficient particle-based implementation of the EFP update, and also suggests a connection to gradient boosting methods. We illustrate the efficiency of our novel implementation in experiments including neural network optimization and image synthesis.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nitanda23a	Atsushi Nitanda, Kazusato Oko, Denny Wu, Nobuhito Takenouchi, Taiji Suzuki
Input Perturbation Reduces Exposure Bias in Diffusion Models	Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models have shown an impressive generation quality although their long sampling chain leads to high computational costs. In this paper, we observe that a long sampling chain also leads to an error accumulation phenomenon, which is similar to the exposure bias problem in autoregressive text generation. Specifically, we note that there is a discrepancy between training and testing, since the former is conditioned on the ground truth samples, while the latter is conditioned on the previously generated results. To alleviate this problem, we propose a very simple but effective training regularization, consisting in perturbing the ground truth samples to simulate the inference time prediction errors. We empirically show that, without affecting the recall and precision, the proposed input perturbation leads to a significant improvement in the sample quality while reducing both the training and the inference times. For instance, on CelebA 64x64, we achieve a new state-of-the-art FID score of 1.27, while saving 37.5% of the training time.

Anti-Exploration by Random Network Distillation	Despite the success of Random Network Distillation (RND) in various domains, it was shown as not discriminative enough to be used as an uncertainty estimator for penalizing out-of-distribution actions in offline reinforcement learning. In this paper, we revisit these results and show that, with a naive choice of conditioning for the RND prior, it becomes infeasible for the actor to effectively minimize the anti-exploration bonus and discriminativity is not an issue. We show that this limitation can be avoided with conditioning based on Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM), resulting in a simple and efficient ensemble-free algorithm based on Soft Actor-Critic. We evaluate it on the D4RL benchmark, showing that it is capable of achieving performance comparable to ensemble-based methods and outperforming ensemble-free approaches by a wide margin.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nikulin23a	Alexander Nikulin, Vladislav Kurenkov, Denis Tarasov, Sergey Kolesnikov

SinFusion: Training Diffusion Models on a Single Image or Video	Diffusion models exhibited tremendous progress in image and video generation, exceeding GANs in quality and diversity. However, they are usually trained on very large datasets and are not naturally adapted to manipulate a given input image or video. In this paper we show how this can be resolved by training a diffusion model on a single input image or video. Our image/video-specific diffusion model (SinFusion) learns the appearance and dynamics of the single image or video, while utilizing the conditioning capabilities of diffusion models. It can solve a wide array of image/video-specific manipulation tasks. In particular, our model can learn from few frames the motion and dynamics of a single input video. It can then generate diverse new video samples of the same dynamic scene, extrapolate short videos into long ones (both forward and backward in time) and perform video upsampling. Most of these tasks are not realizable by current video-specific generation methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nikankin23a	Yaniv Nikankin, Niv Haim, Michal Irani
A Framework for Adapting Offline Algorithms to Solve Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit Problems with Bandit Feedback	We investigate the problem of stochastic, combinatorial multi-armed bandits where the learner only has access to bandit feedback and the reward function can be non-linear. We provide a general framework for adapting discrete offline approximation algorithms into sublinear $\alpha$-regret methods that only require bandit feedback, achieving $\mathcal{O}\left(T^\frac{2}{3}\log(T)^\frac{1}{3}\right)$ expected cumulative $\alpha$-regret dependence on the horizon $T$. The framework only requires the offline algorithms to be robust to small errors in function evaluation. The adaptation procedure does not even require explicit knowledge of the offline approximation algorithm — the offline algorithm can be used as black box subroutine. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework, the proposed framework is applied to multiple problems in submodular maximization, adapting approximation algorithms for cardinality and for knapsack constraints. The new CMAB algorithms for knapsack constraints outperform a full-bandit method developed for the adversarial setting in experiments with real-world data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nie23b	Guanyu Nie, Yididiya Y.

Attributing Image Generative Models using Latent Fingerprints	Generative models have enabled the creation of contents that are indistinguishable from those taken from nature. Open-source development of such models raised concerns about the risks of their misuse for malicious purposes. One potential risk mitigation strategy is to attribute generative models via fingerprinting. Current fingerprinting methods exhibit a significant tradeoff between robust attribution accuracy and generation quality while lacking design principles to improve this tradeoff. This paper investigates the use of latent semantic dimensions as fingerprints, from where we can analyze the effects of design variables, including the choice of fingerprinting dimensions, strength, and capacity, on the accuracy-quality tradeoff. Compared with previous SOTA, our method requires minimum computation and is more applicable to large-scale models. We use StyleGAN2 and the latent diffusion model to demonstrate the efficacy of our method.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nie23a	Guangyu Nie, Changhoon Kim, Yezhou Yang, Yi Ren
Continual Vision-Language Representation Learning with Off-Diagonal Information	Large-scale multi-modal contrastive learning frameworks like CLIP typically require a large amount of image-text samples for training. However, these samples are always collected continuously in real scenarios. This paper discusses the feasibility of continual CLIP training using streaming data. Unlike continual learning based on self-supervised learning methods for pure images, which is empirically robust against catastrophic forgetting, CLIP's performance degeneration in the continual setting is significant and non-neglectable. By analyzing the changes in the model's representation space during continual CLIP training from a spatial geometry perspective, we explore and summarize these spatial variations as	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ni23c	Zixuan Ni, Longhui Wei, Siliang Tang, Yueting Zhuang, Qi Tian
LEVER: Learning to Verify Language-to-Code Generation with Execution	The advent of large language models trained on code (code LLMs) has led to significant progress in language-to-code generation. State-of-the-art approaches in this area combine LLM decoding with sample pruning and reranking using test cases or heuristics based on the execution results. However, it is challenging to obtain test cases for many real-world language-to-code applications, and heuristics cannot well capture the semantic features of the execution results, such as data type and value range, which often indicates the correctness of the program. In this work, we propose LEVER, a simple approach to improve language-to-code generation by learning to verify the generated programs with their execution results. Specifically, we train verifiers to determine whether a program sampled from the LLMs is correct or not based on the natural language input, the program itself and its execution results. The sampled programs are reranked by combining the verification score with the LLM generation probability, and marginalizing over programs with the same execution results. On four datasets across the domains of table QA, math QA and basic Python programming, LEVER consistently improves over the base code LLMs (4.6% to 10.9% with code-davinci-002) and achieves new state-of-the-art results on all of them.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ni23b	Ansong Ni, Srini Iyer, Dragomir Radev, Veselin Stoyanov, Wen-Tau Yih, Sida Wang, Xi Victoria Lin
MetaDiffuser: Diffusion Model as Conditional Planner for Offline Meta-RL	Recently, diffusion model shines as a promising backbone for the sequence modeling paradigm in offline reinforcement learning(RL). However, these works mostly lack the generalization ability across tasks with reward or dynamics change. To tackle this challenge, in this paper we propose a task-oriented conditioned diffusion planner for offline meta-RL(MetaDiffuser), which considers the generalization problem as conditional trajectory generation task with contextual representation. The key is to learn a context conditioned diffusion model which can generate task-oriented trajectories for planning across diverse tasks. To enhance the dynamics consistency of the generated trajectories while encouraging trajectories to achieve high returns, we further design a dual-guided module in the sampling process of the diffusion model. The proposed framework enjoys the robustness to the quality of collected warm-start data from the testing task and the flexibility to incorporate with different task representation method. The experiment results on MuJoCo benchmarks show that MetaDiffuser outperforms other strong offline meta-RL baselines, demonstrating the outstanding conditional generation ability of diffusion architecture.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ni23a	Fei Ni, Jianye Hao, Yao Mu, Yifu Yuan, Yan Zheng, Bin Wang, Zhixuan Liang
Simple Disentanglement of Style and Content in Visual Representations	Learning visual representations with interpretable features, i.e., disentangled representations, remains a challenging problem. Existing methods demonstrate some success but are hard to apply to large-scale vision datasets like ImageNet. In this work, we propose a simple post-processing framework to disentangle content and style in learned representations from pre-trained vision models. We model the pre-trained features probabilistically as linearly entangled combinations of the latent content and style factors and develop a simple disentanglement algorithm based on the probabilistic model. We show that the method provably disentangles content and style features and verify its efficacy empirically. Our post-processed features yield significant domain generalization performance improvements when the distribution shift occurs due to style changes or style-related spurious correlations.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ngweta23a	Lilian Ngweta, Subha Maity, Alex Gittens, Yuekai Sun, Mikhail Yurochkin
Building Neural Networks on Matrix Manifolds: A Gyrovector Space Approach	Matrix manifolds, such as manifolds of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices and Grassmann manifolds, appear in many applications. Recently, by applying the theory of gyrogroups and gyrovector spaces that is a powerful framework for studying hyperbolic geometry, some works have attempted to build principled generalizations of Euclidean neural networks on matrix manifolds. However, due to the lack of many concepts in gyrovector spaces for the considered manifolds, e.g., the inner product and gyroangles, techniques and mathematical tools provided by these works are still limited compared to those developed for studying hyperbolic geometry. In this paper, we generalize some notions in gyrovector spaces for SPD and Grassmann manifolds, and propose new models and layers for building neural networks on these manifolds. We show the effectiveness of our approach in two applications, i.e., human action recognition and knowledge graph completion.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nguyen23f	Xuan Son Nguyen, Shuo Yang
Self-Attention Amortized Distributional Projection Optimization for Sliced Wasserstein Point-Cloud Reconstruction	"Max sliced Wasserstein (Max-SW) distance has been widely known as a solution for less discriminative projections of sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance. In applications that have various independent pairs of probability measures, amortized projection optimization is utilized to predict the ""max"" projecting directions given two input measures instead of using projected gradient ascent multiple times. Despite being efficient, Max-SW and its amortized version cannot guarantee metricity property due to the sub-optimality of the projected gradient ascent and the amortization gap. Therefore, we propose to replace Max-SW with distributional sliced Wasserstein distance with von Mises-Fisher (vMF) projecting distribution (v-DSW). Since v-DSW is a metric with any non-degenerate vMF distribution, its amortized version can guarantee the metricity when performing amortization. Furthermore, current amortized models are not permutation invariant and symmetric. To address the issue, we design amortized models based on self-attention architecture. In particular, we adopt efficient self-attention architectures to make the computation linear in the number of supports. With the two improvements, we derive self-attention amortized distributional projection optimization and show its appealing performance in point-cloud reconstruction and its downstream applications"	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nguyen23e	Khai Nguyen, Dang Nguyen, Nhat Ho
Deep Clustering with Incomplete Noisy Pairwise Annotations: A Geometric Regularization Approach	The recent integration of deep learning and pairwise similarity annotation-based constrained clustering—i.e., deep constrained clustering (DCC)—has proven effective for incorporating weak supervision into massive data clustering: Less than 1% of pair similarity annotations can often substantially enhance the clustering accuracy. However, beyond empirical successes, there is a lack of understanding of DCC. In addition, many DCC paradigms are sensitive to annotation noise, but performance-guaranteed noisy DCC methods have been largely elusive. This work first takes a deep look into a recently emerged logistic loss function of DCC, and characterizes its theoretical properties. Our result shows that the logistic DCC loss ensures the identifiability of data membership under reasonable conditions, which may shed light on its effectiveness in practice. Building upon this understanding, a new loss function based on geometric factor analysis is proposed to fend against noisy annotations. It is shown that even under unknown annotation confusions, the data membership can still be provably identified under our proposed learning criterion. The proposed approach is tested over multiple datasets to validate our claims.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nguyen23d	Tri Nguyen, Shahana Ibrahim, Xiao Fu
Revisiting Over-smoothing and Over-squashing Using Ollivier-Ricci Curvature	Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) had been demonstrated to be inherently susceptible to the problems of over-smoothing and over-squashing. These issues prohibit the ability of GNNs to model complex graph interactions by limiting their effectiveness in taking into account distant information. Our study reveals the key connection between the local graph geometry and the occurrence of both of these issues, thereby providing a unified framework for studying them at a local scale using the Ollivier-Ricci curvature. Specifically, we demonstrate that over-smoothing is linked to positive graph curvature while over-squashing is linked to negative graph curvature. Based on our theory, we propose the Batch Ollivier-Ricci Flow, a novel rewiring algorithm capable of simultaneously addressing both over-smoothing and over-squashing.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nguyen23c	Khang Nguyen, Nong Minh Hieu, Vinh Duc Nguyen, Nhat Ho, Stanley Osher, Tan Minh Nguyen
Provable Reset-free Reinforcement Learning by No-Regret Reduction	Reinforcement learning (RL) so far has limited real-world applications. One key challenge is that typical RL algorithms heavily rely on a reset mechanism to sample proper initial states; these reset mechanisms, in practice, are expensive to implement due to the need for human intervention or heavily engineered environments. To make learning more practical, we propose a generic no-regret reduction to systematically design reset-free RL algorithms. Our reduction turns the reset-free RL problem into a two-player game. We show that achieving sublinear regret in this two-player game would imply learning a policy that has both sublinear performance regret and sublinear total number of resets in the original RL problem. This means that the agent eventually learns to perform optimally and avoid resets. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this reduction, we design an instantiation for linear Markov decision processes, which is the first provably correct reset-free RL algorithm.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nguyen23b	Hoai-An Nguyen, Ching-An Cheng
ClimaX: A foundation model for weather and climate	Recent data-driven approaches based on machine learning aim to directly solve a downstream forecasting or projection task by learning a data-driven functional mapping using deep neural networks. However, these networks are trained using curated and homogeneous climate datasets for specific spatiotemporal tasks, and thus lack the generality of currently used computationally intensive physics-informed numerical models for weather and climate modeling. We develop and demonstrate ClimaX, a flexible and generalizable deep learning model for weather and climate science that can be trained using heterogeneous datasets spanning different variables, spatio-temporal coverage, and physical groundings. ClimaX extends the Transformer architecture with novel encoding and aggregation blocks that allow effective use of available compute and data while maintaining general utility. ClimaX is pretrained with a self-supervised learning objective on climate datasets derived from CMIP6. The pretrained ClimaX can then be fine-tuned to address a breadth of climate and weather tasks, including those that involve atmospheric variables and spatio-temporal scales unseen during pretraining. Compared to existing data-driven baselines, we show that this generality in ClimaX results in superior performance on benchmarks for weather forecasting and climate projections, even when pretrained at lower resolutions and compute budgets.

Extending Conformal Prediction to Hidden Markov Models with Exact Validity via de Finetti’s Theorem for Markov Chains	Conformal prediction is a widely used method to quantify the uncertainty of a classifier under the assumption of exchangeability (e.g., IID data). We generalize conformal prediction to the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework where the assumption of exchangeability is not valid. The key idea of the proposed method is to partition the non-exchangeable Markovian data from the HMM into exchangeable blocks by exploiting the de Finetti's Theorem for Markov Chains discovered by Diaconis and Freedman (1980). The permutations of the exchangeable blocks are viewed as randomizations of the observed Markovian data from the HMM. The proposed method provably retains all desirable theoretical guarantees offered by the classical conformal prediction framework in both exchangeable and Markovian settings. In particular, while the lack of exchangeability introduced by Markovian samples constitutes a violation of a crucial assumption for classical conformal prediction, the proposed method views it as an advantage that can be exploited to improve the performance further. Detailed numerical and empirical results that complement the theoretical conclusions are provided to illustrate the practical feasibility of the proposed method.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nettasinghe23a	Buddhika Nettasinghe, Samrat Chatterjee, Ramakrishna Tipireddy, Mahantesh M Halappanavar
Action Matching: Learning Stochastic Dynamics from Samples	Learning the continuous dynamics of a system from snapshots of its temporal marginals is a problem which appears throughout natural sciences and machine learning, including in quantum systems, single-cell biological data, and generative modeling. In these settings, we assume access to cross-sectional samples that are uncorrelated over time, rather than full trajectories of samples. In order to better understand the systems under observation, we would like to learn a model of the underlying process that allows us to propagate samples in time and thereby simulate entire individual trajectories. In this work, we propose Action Matching, a method for learning a rich family of dynamics using only independent samples from its time evolution. We derive a tractable training objective, which does not rely on explicit assumptions about the underlying dynamics and does not require back-propagation through differential equations or optimal transport solvers. Inspired by connections with optimal transport, we derive extensions of Action Matching to learn stochastic differential equations and dynamics involving creation and destruction of probability mass. Finally, we showcase applications of Action Matching by achieving competitive performance in a diverse set of experiments from biology, physics, and generative modeling.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/neklyudov23a	Kirill Neklyudov, Rob Brekelmans, Daniel Severo, Alireza Makhzani
Geometric Autoencoders What You See is What You Decode	"Visualization is a crucial step in exploratory data analysis. One possible approach is to train an autoencoder with low-dimensional latent space. Large network depth and width can help unfolding the data. However, such expressive networks can achieve low reconstruction error even when the latent representation is distorted. To avoid such misleading visualizations, we propose first a differential geometric perspective on the decoder, leading to insightful diagnostics for an embedding's distortion, and second a new regularizer mitigating such distortion. Our ""Geometric Autoencoder"" avoids stretching the embedding spuriously, so that the visualization captures the data structure more faithfully. It also flags areas where little distortion could not be achieved, thus guarding against misinterpretation."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nazari23a	Philipp Nazari, Sebastian Damrich, Fred A Hamprecht
Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning through Intelligent Information Aggregation	We consider the problem of multi-agent navigation and collision avoidance when observations are limited to the local neighborhood of each agent. We propose InforMARL, a novel architecture for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) which uses local information intelligently to compute paths for all the agents in a decentralized manner. Specifically, InforMARL aggregates information about the local neighborhood of agents for both the actor and the critic using a graph neural network and can be used in conjunction with any standard MARL algorithm. We show that (1) in training, InforMARL has better sample efficiency and performance than baseline approaches, despite using less information, and (2) in testing, it scales well to environments with arbitrary numbers of agents and obstacles. We illustrate these results using four task environments, including one with predetermined goals for each agent, and one in which the agents collectively try to cover all goals.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nayak23a	Siddharth Nayak, Kenneth Choi, Wenqi Ding, Sydney Dolan, Karthik Gopalakrishnan, Hamsa Balakrishnan
Equivariant Architectures for Learning in Deep Weight Spaces	Designing machine learning architectures for processing neural networks in their raw weight matrix form is a newly introduced research direction. Unfortunately, the unique symmetry structure of deep weight spaces makes this design very challenging. If successful, such architectures would be capable of performing a wide range of intriguing tasks, from adapting a pre-trained network to a new domain to editing objects represented as functions (INRs or NeRFs). As a first step towards this goal, we present here a novel network architecture for learning in deep weight spaces. It takes as input a concatenation of weights and biases of a pre-trained MLP and processes it using a composition of layers that are equivariant to the natural permutation symmetry of the MLP's weights: Changing the order of neurons in intermediate layers of the MLP does not affect the function it represents. We provide a full characterization of all affine equivariant and invariant layers for these symmetries and show how these layers can be implemented using three basic operations: pooling, broadcasting, and fully connected layers applied to the input in an appropriate manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our architecture and its advantages over natural baselines in a variety of learning tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/navon23a	Aviv Navon, Aviv Shamsian, Idan Achituve, Ethan Fetaya, Gal Chechik, Haggai Maron
On Many-Actions Policy Gradient	We study the variance of stochastic policy gradients (SPGs) with many action samples per state. We derive a many-actions optimality condition, which determines when many-actions SPG yields lower variance as compared to a single-action agent with proportionally extended trajectory. We propose Model-Based Many-Actions (MBMA), an approach leveraging dynamics models for many-actions sampling in the context of SPG. MBMA addresses issues associated with existing implementations of many-actions SPG and yields lower bias and comparable variance to SPG estimated from states in model-simulated rollouts. We find that MBMA bias and variance structure matches that predicted by theory. As a result, MBMA achieves improved sample efficiency and higher returns on a range of continuous action environments as compared to model-free, many-actions, and model-based on-policy SPG baselines.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nauman23a	Michal Nauman, Marek Cygan
Discovering Object-Centric Generalized Value Functions From Pixels	Deep Reinforcement Learning has shown significant progress in extracting useful representations from high-dimensional inputs albeit using hand-crafted auxiliary tasks and pseudo rewards. Automatically learning such representations in an object-centric manner geared towards control and fast adaptation remains an open research problem. In this paper, we introduce a method that tries to discover meaningful features from objects, translating them to temporally coherent 'question' functions and leveraging the subsequent learned general value functions for control. We compare our approach with state-of-the-art techniques alongside other ablations and show competitive performance in both stationary and non-stationary settings. Finally, we also investigate the discovered general value functions and through qualitative analysis show that the learned representations are not only interpretable but also, centered around objects that are invariant to changes across tasks facilitating fast adaptation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nath23a	Somjit Nath, Gopeshh Subbaraj, Khimya Khetarpal, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou
Counterfactual Identifiability of Bijective Causal Models	We study counterfactual identifiability in causal models with bijective generation mechanisms (BGM), a class that generalizes several widely-used causal models in the literature. We establish their counterfactual identifiability for three common causal structures with unobserved confounding, and propose a practical learning method that casts learning a BGM as structured generative modeling. Learned BGMs enable efficient counterfactual estimation and can be obtained using a variety of deep conditional generative models. We evaluate our techniques in a visual task and demonstrate its application in a real-world video streaming simulation task.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nasr-esfahany23a	Arash Nasr-Esfahany, Mohammad Alizadeh, Devavrat Shah

Sample and Predict Your Latent: Modality-free Sequential Disentanglement via Contrastive Estimation	Unsupervised disentanglement is a long-standing challenge in representation learning. Recently, self-supervised techniques achieved impressive results in the sequential setting, where data is time-dependent. However, the latter methods employ modality-based data augmentations and random sampling or solve auxiliary tasks. In this work, we propose to avoid that by generating, sampling, and comparing empirical distributions from the underlying variational model. Unlike existing work, we introduce a self-supervised sequential disentanglement framework based on contrastive estimation with no external signals, while using common batch sizes and samples from the latent space itself. In practice, we propose a unified, efficient, and easy-to-code sampling strategy for semantically similar and dissimilar views of the data. We evaluate our approach on video, audio, and time series benchmarks. Our method presents state-of-the-art results in comparison to existing techniques.

Do Machine Learning Models Learn Statistical Rules Inferred from Data?	Machine learning models can make critical errors that are easily hidden within vast amounts of data. Such errors often run counter to rules based on human intuition. However, rules based on human knowledge are challenging to scale or to even formalize. We thereby seek to infer statistical rules from the data and quantify the extent to which a model has learned them. We propose a framework SQRL that integrates logic-based methods with statistical inference to derive these rules from a model's training data without supervision. We further show how to adapt models at test time to reduce rule violations and produce more coherent predictions. SQRL generates up to 300K rules over datasets from vision, tabular, and language settings. We uncover up to 158K violations of those rules by state-of-the-art models for classification, object detection, and data imputation. Test-time adaptation reduces these violations by up to 68.7% with relative performance improvement up to 32%. SQRL is available at https://github.com/DebugML/sqrl.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/naik23a	Aaditya Naik, Yinjun Wu, Mayur Naik, Eric Wong
Statistical Foundations of Prior-Data Fitted Networks	Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) were recently proposed as a new paradigm for machine learning. Instead of training the network to an observed training set, a fixed model is pre-trained offline on small, simulated training sets from a variety of tasks. The pre-trained model is then used to infer class probabilities in-context on fresh training sets with arbitrary size and distribution. Empirically, PFNs achieve state-of-the-art performance on tasks with similar size to the ones used in pre-training. Surprisingly, their accuracy further improves when passed larger data sets during inference. This article establishes a theoretical foundation for PFNs and illuminates the statistical mechanisms governing their behavior. While PFNs are motivated by Bayesian ideas, a purely frequentistic interpretation of PFNs as pre-tuned, but untrained predictors explains their behavior. A predictor's variance vanishes if its sensitivity to individual training samples does and the bias vanishes only if it is appropriately localized around the test feature. The transformer architecture used in current PFN implementations ensures only the former. These findings shall prove useful for designing architectures with favorable empirical behavior.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nagler23a	Thomas Nagler
Multi-User Reinforcement Learning with Low Rank Rewards	"We consider collaborative multi-user reinforcement learning, where multiple users have the same state-action space and transition probabilities but different rewards. Under the assumption that the reward matrix of the $N$ users has a low-rank structure – a standard and practically successful assumption in the collaborative filtering setting – we design algorithms with significantly lower sample complexity compared to the ones that learn the MDP individually for each user. Our main contribution is an algorithm which explores rewards collaboratively with $N$ user-specific MDPs and can learn rewards efficiently in two key settings: tabular MDPs and linear MDPs. When $N$ is large and the rank is constant, the sample complexity per MDP depends logarithmically over the size of the state-space, which represents an exponential reduction (in the state-space size) when compared to the standard ""non-collaborative"" algorithms. Our main technical contribution is a method to construct policies which obtain data such that low rank matrix completion is possible (without a generative model). This goes beyond the regular RL framework and is closely related to mean field limits of multi-agent RL."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nagaraj23a	Dheeraj Mysore Nagaraj, Suhas S Kowshik, Naman Agarwal, Praneeth Netrapalli, Prateek Jain
DADAO: Decoupled Accelerated Decentralized Asynchronous Optimization	This work introduces DADAO: the first decentralized, accelerated, asynchronous, primal, first-order algorithm to minimize a sum of $L$-smooth and $\mu$-strongly convex functions distributed over a given network of size $n$. Our key insight is based on modeling the local gradient updates and gossip communication procedures with separate independent Poisson Point Processes. This allows us to decouple the computation and communication steps, which can be run in parallel, while making the whole approach completely asynchronous. This leads to communication acceleration compared to synchronous approaches. Our new method employs primal gradients and does not use a multi-consensus inner loop nor other ad-hoc mechanisms such as Error Feedback, Gradient Tracking, or a Proximal operator. By relating the inverse of the smallest positive eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix $\chi_1$ and the maximal resistance $\chi_2\leq \chi_1$ of the graph to a sufficient minimal communication rate between the nodes of the network, we show that our algorithm requires $\mathcal{O}(n\sqrt{\frac{L}{\mu}}\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ local gradients and only $\mathcal{O}(n\sqrt{\chi_1\chi_2}\sqrt{\frac{L}{\mu}}\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ communications to reach a precision $\epsilon$, up to logarithmic terms. Thus, we simultaneously obtain an accelerated rate for both computations and communications, leading to an improvement over state-of-the-art works, our simulations further validating the strength of our relatively unconstrained method.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nabli23a	Adel Nabli, Edouard Oyallon
Representation-Driven Reinforcement Learning	We present a representation-driven framework for reinforcement learning. By representing policies as estimates of their expected values, we leverage techniques from contextual bandits to guide exploration and exploitation. Particularly, embedding a policy network into a linear feature space allows us to reframe the exploration-exploitation problem as a representation-exploitation problem, where good policy representations enable optimal exploration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework through its application to evolutionary and policy gradient-based approaches, leading to significantly improved performance compared to traditional methods. Our framework provides a new perspective on reinforcement learning, highlighting the importance of policy representation in determining optimal exploration-exploitation strategies.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/nabati23a	Ofir Nabati, Guy Tennenholtz, Shie Mannor
Dynamical Linear Bandits	In many real-world sequential decision-making problems, an action does not immediately reflect on the feedback and spreads its effects over a long time frame. For instance, in online advertising, investing in a platform produces an instantaneous increase of awareness, but the actual reward, i.e., a conversion, might occur far in the future. Furthermore, whether a conversion takes place depends on: how fast the awareness grows, its vanishing effects, and the synergy or interference with other advertising platforms. Previous work has investigated the Multi-Armed Bandit framework with the possibility of delayed and aggregated feedback, without a particular structure on how an action propagates in the future, disregarding possible dynamical effects. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting, the Dynamical Linear Bandits (DLB), an extension of the linear bandits characterized by a hidden state. When an action is performed, the learner observes a noisy reward whose mean is a linear function of the hidden state and of the action. Then, the hidden state evolves according to linear dynamics, affected by the performed action too. We start by introducing the setting, discussing the notion of optimal policy, and deriving an expected regret lower bound. Then, we provide an optimistic regret minimization algorithm, Dynamical Linear Upper Confidence Bound (DynLin-UCB), that suffers an expected regret of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} \Big( \frac{d \sqrt{T}}{(1-\overline{\rho})^{3/2}} \Big)$, where $\overline{\rho}$ is a measure of the stability of the system, and $d$ is the dimension of the action vector. Finally, we conduct a numerical validation on a synthetic environment and on real-world data to show the effectiveness of DynLin-UCB in comparison with several baselines.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mussi23a	Marco Mussi, Alberto Maria Metelli, Marcello Restelli
Efficiently predicting high resolution mass spectra with graph neural networks	Identifying a small molecule from its mass spectrum is the primary open problem in computational metabolomics. This is typically cast as information retrieval: an unknown spectrum is matched against spectra predicted computationally from a large database of chemical structures. However, current approaches to spectrum prediction model the output space in ways that force a tradeoff between capturing high resolution mass information and tractable learning. We resolve this tradeoff by casting spectrum prediction as a mapping from an input molecular graph to a probability distribution over chemical formulas. We further discover that a large corpus of mass spectra can be closely approximated using a fixed vocabulary constituting only 2% of all observed formulas. This enables efficient spectrum prediction using an architecture similar to graph classification - GrAFF-MS - achieving significantly lower prediction error and greater retrieval accuracy than previous approaches.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/murphy23a	Michael Murphy, Stefanie Jegelka, Ernest Fraenkel, Tobias Kind, David Healey, Thomas Butler
DIFF2: Differential Private Optimization via Gradient Differences for Nonconvex Distributed Learning	Differential private optimization for nonconvex smooth objective is considered. In the previous work, the best known utility bound is $\widetilde O(\sqrt{d}/(n\varepsilon_\mathrm{DP}))$ in terms of the squared full gradient norm, which is achieved by Differential Private Gradient Descent (DP-GD) as an instance, where $n$ is the sample size, $d$ is the problem dimensionality and $\varepsilon_\mathrm{DP}$ is the differential privacy parameter. To improve the best known utility bound, we propose a new differential private optimization framework called DIFF2 (DIFFerential private optimization via gradient DIFFerences) that constructs a differential private global gradient estimator with possibly quite small variance based on communicated gradient differences rather than gradients themselves. It is shown that DIFF2 with a gradient descent subroutine achieves the utility of $\widetilde O(d^{2/3}/(n\varepsilon_\mathrm{DP})^{4/3})$, which can be significantly better than the previous one in terms of the dependence on the sample size $n$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fundamental result to improve the standard utility $\widetilde O(\sqrt{d}/(n\varepsilon_\mathrm{DP}))$ for nonconvex objectives. Additionally, a more computational and communication efficient subroutine is combined with DIFF2 and its theoretical analysis is also given. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the superiority of DIFF2 framework.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/murata23b	Tomoya Murata, Taiji Suzuki
GibbsDDRM: A Partially Collapsed Gibbs Sampler for Solving Blind Inverse Problems with Denoising Diffusion Restoration	Pre-trained diffusion models have been successfully used as priors in a variety of linear inverse problems, where the goal is to reconstruct a signal from noisy linear measurements. However, existing approaches require knowledge of the linear operator. In this paper, we propose GibbsDDRM, an extension of Denoising Diffusion Restoration Models (DDRM) to a blind setting in which the linear measurement operator is unknown. GibbsDDRM constructs a joint distribution of the data, measurements, and linear operator by using a pre-trained diffusion model for the data prior, and it solves the problem by posterior sampling with an efficient variant of a Gibbs sampler. The proposed method is problem-agnostic, meaning that a pre-trained diffusion model can be applied to various inverse problems without fine-tuning. In experiments, it achieved high performance on both blind image deblurring and vocal dereverberation tasks, despite the use of simple generic priors for the underlying linear operators.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/murata23a	Naoki Murata, Koichi Saito, Chieh-Hsin Lai, Yuhta Takida, Toshimitsu Uesaka, Yuki Mitsufuji, Stefano Ermon
Uncertain Evidence in Probabilistic Models and Stochastic Simulators	"We consider the problem of performing Bayesian inference in probabilistic models where observations are accompanied by uncertainty, referred to as ""uncertain evidence."" We explore how to interpret uncertain evidence, and by extension the importance of proper interpretation as it pertains to inference about latent variables. We consider a recently-proposed method ""distributional evidence"" as well as revisit two older methods: Jeffrey's rule and virtual evidence. We devise guidelines on how to account for uncertain evidence and we provide new insights, particularly regarding consistency. To showcase the impact of different interpretations of the same uncertain evidence, we carry out experiments in which one interpretation is defined as ""correct."" We then compare inference results from each different interpretation illustrating the importance of careful consideration of uncertain evidence."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/munk23a	Andreas Munk, Alexander Mead, Frank Wood
Achieving High Accuracy with PINNs via Energy Natural Gradient Descent	We propose energy natural gradient descent, a natural gradient method with respect to a Hessian-induced Riemannian metric as an optimization algorithm for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and the deep Ritz method. As a main motivation we show that the update direction in function space resulting from the energy natural gradient corresponds to the Newton direction modulo an orthogonal projection on the model's tangent space. We demonstrate experimentally that energy natural gradient descent yields highly accurate solutions with errors several orders of magnitude smaller than what is obtained when training PINNs with standard optimizers like gradient descent or Adam, even when those are allowed significantly more computation time.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/muller23b	Johannes Müller, Marius Zeinhofer
PFNs4BO: In-Context Learning for Bayesian Optimization	In this paper, we use Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) as a flexible surrogate for Bayesian Optimization (BO). PFNs are neural processes that are trained to approximate the posterior predictive distribution (PPD) through in-context learning on any prior distribution that can be efficiently sampled from. We describe how this flexibility can be exploited for surrogate modeling in BO. We use PFNs to mimic a naive Gaussian process (GP), an advanced GP, and a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN). In addition, we show how to incorporate further information into the prior, such as allowing hints about the position of optima (user priors), ignoring irrelevant dimensions, and performing non-myopic BO by learning the acquisition function. The flexibility underlying these extensions opens up vast possibilities for using PFNs for BO. We demonstrate the usefulness of PFNs for BO in a large-scale evaluation on artificial GP samples and three different hyperparameter optimization testbeds: HPO-B, Bayesmark, and PD1. We publish code alongside trained models at https://github.com/automl/PFNs4BO.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/muller23a	Samuel Müller, Matthias Feurer, Noah Hollmann, Frank Hutter
Improving Statistical Fidelity for Neural Image Compression with Implicit Local Likelihood Models	Lossy image compression aims to represent images in as few bits as possible while maintaining fidelity to the original. Theoretical results indicate that optimizing distortion metrics such as PSNR or MS-SSIM necessarily leads to a discrepancy in the statistics of original images from those of reconstructions, in particular at low bitrates, often manifested by the blurring of the compressed images. Previous work has leveraged adversarial discriminators to improve statistical fidelity. Yet these binary discriminators adopted from generative modeling tasks may not be ideal for image compression. In this paper, we introduce a non-binary discriminator that is conditioned on quantized local image representations obtained via VQ-VAE autoencoders. Our evaluations on the CLIC2020, DIV2K and Kodak datasets show that our discriminator is more effective for jointly optimizing distortion (e.g., PSNR) and statistical fidelity (e.g., FID) than the PatchGAN of the state-of-the-art HiFiC model. On CLIC2020, we obtain the same FID as HiFiC with 30-40% fewer bits.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/muckley23a	Matthew J. Muckley, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Karen Ullrich, Herve Jegou, Jakob Verbeek
Neural signature kernels as infinite-width-depth-limits of controlled ResNets	Motivated by the paradigm of reservoir computing, we consider randomly initialized controlled ResNets defined as Euler-discretizations of neural controlled differential equations (Neural CDEs), a unified architecture which enconpasses both RNNs and ResNets. We show that in the infinite-width-depth limit and under proper scaling, these architectures converge weakly to Gaussian processes indexed on some spaces of continuous paths and with kernels satisfying certain partial differential equations (PDEs) varying according to the choice of activation function $\varphi$, extending the results of Hayou (2022); Hayou & Yang (2023) to the controlled and homogeneous case. In the special, homogeneous, case where $\varphi$ is the identity, we show that the equation reduces to a linear PDE and the limiting kernel agrees with the signature kernel of Salvi et al. (2021a). We name this new family of limiting kernels neural signature kernels. Finally, we show that in the infinite-depth regime, finite-width controlled ResNets converge in distribution to Neural CDEs with random vector fields which, depending on whether the weights are shared across layers, are either time-independent and Gaussian or behave like a matrix-valued Brownian motion.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/muca-cirone23a	Nicola Muca Cirone, Maud Lemercier, Cristopher Salvi
Optimistic Planning by Regularized Dynamic Programming	We propose a new method for optimistic planning in infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision processes based on the idea of adding regularization to the updates of an otherwise standard approximate value iteration procedure. This technique allows us to avoid contraction and monotonicity arguments typically required by existing analyses of approximate dynamic programming methods, and in particular to use approximate transition functions estimated via least-squares procedures in MDPs with linear function approximation. We use our method to recover known guarantees in tabular MDPs and to provide a computationally efficient algorithm for learning near-optimal policies in discounted linear mixture MDPs from a single stream of experience, and show it achieves near-optimal statistical guarantees.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/moulin23a	Antoine Moulin, Gergely Neu
ReLOAD: Reinforcement Learning with Optimistic Ascent-Descent for Last-Iterate Convergence in Constrained MDPs	In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to real-world problems with increasing success. Such applications often require to put constraints on the agent's behavior. Existing algorithms for constrained RL (CRL) rely on gradient descent-ascent, but this approach comes with a caveat. While these algorithms are guaranteed to converge on average, they do not guarantee last-iterate convergence, i.e., the current policy of the agent may never converge to the optimal solution. In practice, it is often observed that the policy alternates between satisfying the constraints and maximizing the reward, rarely accomplishing both objectives simultaneously. Here, we address this problem by introducing Reinforcement Learning with Optimistic Ascent-Descent (ReLOAD), a principled CRL method with guaranteed last-iterate convergence. We demonstrate its empirical effectiveness on a wide variety of CRL problems including discrete MDPs and continuous control. In the process we establish a benchmark of challenging CRL problems.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/moskovitz23a	Ted Moskovitz, Brendan O’Donoghue, Vivek Veeriah, Sebastian Flennerhag, Satinder Singh, Tom Zahavy
WL meet VC	Recently, many works studied the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) by linking it to the $1$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm ($1\text{-}\mathsf{WL}$). Here, the $1\text{-}\mathsf{WL}$ is a well-studied heuristic for the graph isomorphism problem, which iteratively colors or partitions a graph's vertex set. While this connection has led to significant advances in understanding and enhancing GNNs' expressive power, it does not provide insights into their generalization performance, i.e., their ability to make meaningful predictions beyond the training set. In this paper, we study GNNs' generalization ability through the lens of Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension theory in two settings, focusing on graph-level predictions. First, when no upper bound on the graphs' order is known, we show that the bitlength of GNNs' weights tightly bounds their VC dimension. Further, we derive an upper bound for GNNs' VC dimension using the number of colors produced by the $1\text{-}\mathsf{WL}$. Secondly, when an upper bound on the graphs' order is known, we show a tight connection between the number of graphs distinguishable by the $1\text{-}\mathsf{WL}$ and GNNs' VC dimension. Our empirical study confirms the validity of our theoretical findings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/morris23a	Christopher Morris, Floris Geerts, Jan Tönshoff, Martin Grohe
Learning Deductive Reasoning from Synthetic Corpus based on Formal Logic	We study a synthetic corpus based approach for language models (LMs) to acquire logical deductive reasoning ability. The previous studies generated deduction examples using specific sets of deduction rules. However, these rules were limited or otherwise arbitrary. This can limit the generalizability of acquired deductive reasoning ability. We rethink this and adopt a well-grounded set of deduction rules based on formal logic theory, which can derive any other deduction rules when combined in a multistep way. We empirically verify that LMs trained on the proposed corpora, which we name $\textbf{FLD}$ ($\textbf{F}$ormal $\textbf{L}$ogic $\textbf{D}$eduction), acquire more generalizable deductive reasoning ability. Furthermore, we identify the aspects of deductive reasoning ability on which deduction corpora can enhance LMs and those on which they cannot. Finally, on the basis of these results, we discuss the future directions for applying deduction corpora or other approaches for each aspect. We release the code, data, and models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/morishita23a	Terufumi Morishita, Gaku Morio, Atsuki Yamaguchi, Yasuhiro Sogawa
An SDE for Modeling SAM: Theory and Insights	We study the SAM (Sharpness-Aware Minimization) optimizer which has recently attracted a lot of interest due to its increased performance over more classical variants of stochastic gradient descent. Our main contribution is the derivation of continuous-time models (in the form of SDEs) for SAM and two of its variants, both for the full-batch and mini-batch settings. We demonstrate that these SDEs are rigorous approximations of the real discrete-time algorithms (in a weak sense, scaling linearly with the learning rate). Using these models, we then offer an explanation of why SAM prefers flat minima over sharp ones – by showing that it minimizes an implicitly regularized loss with a Hessian-dependent noise structure. Finally, we prove that SAM is attracted to saddle points under some realistic conditions. Our theoretical results are supported by detailed experiments.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/monzio-compagnoni23a	Enea Monzio Compagnoni, Luca Biggio, Antonio Orvieto, Frank Norbert Proske, Hans Kersting, Aurelien Lucchi
Compressing Tabular Data via Latent Variable Estimation	Data used for analytics and machine learning often take the form of tables with categorical entries. We introduce a family of lossless compression algorithms for such data that proceed in four steps: (i) Estimate latent variables associated to rows and columns; (ii) Partition the table in blocks according to the row/column latents; (iii) Apply a sequential (e.g. Lempel-Ziv) coder to each of the blocks; (iv) Append a compressed encoding of the latents. We evaluate this approach on several benchmark datasets, and study optimal compression in a probabilistic model for tabular data, whereby latent values are independent and table entries are conditionally independent given the latent values. We prove that the model has a well defined entropy rate and satisfies an asymptotic equipartition property. We also prove that classical compression schemes such as Lempel-Ziv and finite-state encoders do not achieve this rate. On the other hand, the latent estimation strategy outlined above achieves the optimal rate.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/montanari23a	Andrea Montanari, Eric Weiner
Input uncertainty propagation through trained neural networks	When physical sensors are involved, such as image sensors, the uncertainty over the input data is often a major component of the output uncertainty of machine learning models. In this work, we address the problem of input uncertainty propagation through trained neural networks. We do not rely on a Gaussian distribution assumption of the output or of any intermediate layer. We propagate instead a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) that offers much more flexibility, using the Split&Merge algorithm. This paper's main contribution is the computation of a Wasserstein criterion to control the Gaussian splitting procedure for which theoretical guarantees of convergence on the output distribution estimates are derived. The methodology is tested against a wide range of datasets and networks. It shows robustness, and genericity and offers highly accurate output probability density function estimation while maintaining a reasonable computational cost compared with the standard Monte Carlo (MC) approach.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/monchot23a	Paul Monchot, Loic Coquelin, Sébastien Julien Petit, Sébastien Marmin, Erwan Le Pennec, Nicolas Fischer
Neural Inverse Operators for Solving PDE Inverse Problems	A large class of inverse problems for PDEs are only well-defined as mappings from operators to functions. Existing operator learning frameworks map functions to functions and need to be modified to learn inverse maps from data. We propose a novel architecture termed Neural Inverse Operators (NIOs) to solve these PDE inverse problems. Motivated by the underlying mathematical structure, NIO is based on a suitable composition of DeepONets and FNOs to approximate mappings from operators to functions. A variety of experiments are presented to demonstrate that NIOs significantly outperform baselines and solve PDE inverse problems robustly, accurately and are several orders of magnitude faster than existing direct and PDE-constrained optimization methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/molinaro23a	Roberto Molinaro, Yunan Yang, Björn Engquist, Siddhartha Mishra
Special Properties of Gradient Descent with Large Learning Rates	When training neural networks, it has been widely observed that a large step size is essential in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for obtaining superior models. However, the effect of large step sizes on the success of SGD is not well understood theoretically. Several previous works have attributed this success to the stochastic noise present in SGD. However, we show through a novel set of experiments that the stochastic noise is not sufficient to explain good non-convex training, and that instead the effect of a large learning rate itself is essential for obtaining best performance.We demonstrate the same effects also in the noise-less case, i.e. for full-batch GD. We formally prove that GD with large step size —on certain non-convex function classes — follows a different trajectory than GD with a small step size, which can lead to convergence to a global minimum instead of a local one. Our settings provide a framework for future analysis which allows comparing algorithms based on behaviors that can not be observed in the traditional settings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mohtashami23a	Amirkeivan Mohtashami, Martin Jaggi, Sebastian U Stich
A Fast, Well-Founded Approximation to the Empirical Neural Tangent Kernel	"Empirical neural tangent kernels (eNTKs) can provide a good understanding of a given network's representation: they are often far less expensive to compute and applicable more broadly than infinite-width NTKs. For networks with $O$ output units (e.g. an $O$-class classifier), however, the eNTK on $N$ inputs is of size $NO \times NO$, taking $\mathcal O\big( (N O)^2\big)$ memory and up to $\mathcal O\big( (N O)^3 \big)$ computation to use. Most existing applications have therefore used one of a handful of approximations yielding $N \times N$ kernel matrices, saving orders of magnitude of computation, but with limited to no justification. We prove that one such approximation, which we call ""sum of logits,"" converges to the true eNTK at initialization. Our experiments demonstrate the quality of this approximation for various uses across a range of settings."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mohamadi23a	Mohamad Amin Mohamadi, Wonho Bae, Danica J.

Pruning via Sparsity-indexed ODE: a Continuous Sparsity Viewpoint	Neural pruning, which involves identifying the optimal sparse subnetwork, is a key technique for reducing the complexity and improving the efficiency of deep neural networks. To address the challenge of solving neural pruning at a specific sparsity level directly, we investigate the evolution of optimal subnetworks with continuously increasing sparsity, which can provide insight into how to transform an unpruned dense model into an optimal subnetwork with any desired level of sparsity. In this paper, we proposed a novel pruning framework, coined Sparsity-indexed ODE (SpODE) that provides explicit guidance on how to best preserve model performance while ensuring an infinitesimal increase in model sparsity. On top of this, we develop a pruning algorithm, termed Pruning via Sparsity-indexed ODE (PSO), that enables effective pruning via traveling along the SpODE path. Empirical experiments show that PSO achieves either better or comparable performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various pruning settings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mo23c	Zhanfeng Mo, Haosen Shi, Sinno Jialin Pan
A Unified Audio-Visual Learning Framework for Localization, Separation, and Recognition	The ability to accurately recognize, localize and separate sound sources is fundamental to any audio-visual perception task. Historically, these abilities were tackled separately, with several methods developed independently for each task. However, given the interconnected nature of source localization, separation, and recognition, independent models are likely to yield suboptimal performance as they fail to capture the interdependence between these tasks. To address this problem, we propose a unified audio-visual learning framework (dubbed OneAVM) that integrates audio and visual cues for joint localization, separation, and recognition. OneAVM comprises a shared audio-visual encoder and task-specific decoders trained with three objectives. The first objective aligns audio and visual representations through a localized audio-visual correspondence loss. The second tackles visual source separation using a traditional mix-and-separate framework. Finally, the third objective reinforces visual feature separation and localization by mixing images in pixel space and aligning their representations with those of all corresponding sound sources. Extensive experiments on MUSIC, VGG-Instruments, VGG-Music, and VGGSound datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OneAVM for all three tasks, audio-visual source localization, separation, and nearest neighbor recognition, and empirically demonstrate a strong positive transfer between them.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mo23b	Shentong Mo, Pedro Morgado
Disentangled Multiplex Graph Representation Learning	Unsupervised multiplex graph representation learning (UMGRL) has received increasing interest, but few works simultaneously focused on the common and private information extraction. In this paper, we argue that it is essential for conducting effective and robust UMGRL to extract complete and clean common information, as well as more-complementarity and less-noise private information. To achieve this, we first investigate disentangled representation learning for the multiplex graph to capture complete and clean common information, as well as design a contrastive constraint to preserve the complementarity and remove the noise in the private information. Moreover, we theoretically analyze that the common and private representations learned by our method are provably disentangled and contain more task-relevant and less task-irrelevant information to benefit downstream tasks. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of the proposed method in terms of different downstream tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mo23a	Yujie Mo, Yajie Lei, Jialie Shen, Xiaoshuang Shi, Heng Tao Shen, Xiaofeng Zhu
Diffusion Based Representation Learning	Diffusion-based methods, represented as stochastic differential equations on a continuous-time domain, have recently proven successful as non-adversarial generative models. Training such models relies on denoising score matching, which can be seen as multi-scale denoising autoencoders. Here, we augment the denoising score matching framework to enable representation learning without any supervised signal. GANs and VAEs learn representations by directly transforming latent codes to data samples. In contrast, the introduced diffusion-based representation learning relies on a new formulation of the denoising score matching objective and thus encodes the information needed for denoising. We illustrate how this difference allows for manual control of the level of details encoded in the representation. Using the same approach, we propose to learn an infinite-dimensional latent code that achieves improvements on state-of-the-art models on semi-supervised image classification. We also compare the quality of learned representations of diffusion score matching with other methods like autoencoder and contrastively trained systems through their performances on downstream tasks. Finally, we also ablate with a different SDE formulation for diffusion models and show that the benefits on downstream tasks are still present on changing the underlying differential equation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mittal23a	Sarthak Mittal, Korbinian Abstreiter, Stefan Bauer, Bernhard Schölkopf, Arash Mehrjou
DetectGPT: Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection using Probability Curvature	The increasing fluency and widespread usage of large language models (LLMs) highlight the desirability of corresponding tools aiding detection of LLM-generated text. In this paper, we identify a property of the structure of an LLM's probability function that is useful for such detection. Specifically, we demonstrate that text sampled from an LLM tends to occupy negative curvature regions of the model's log probability function. Leveraging this observation, we then define a new curvature-based criterion for judging if a passage is generated from a given LLM. This approach, which we call DetectGPT, does not require training a separate classifier, collecting a dataset of real or generated passages, or explicitly watermarking generated text. It uses only log probabilities computed by the model of interest and random perturbations of the passage from another generic pre-trained language model (e.g., T5). We find DetectGPT is more discriminative than existing zero-shot methods for model sample detection, notably improving detection of fake news articles generated by 20B parameter GPT-NeoX from 0.81 AUROC for the strongest zero-shot baseline to 0.95 AUROC for DetectGPT.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mitchell23a	Eric Mitchell, Yoonho Lee, Alexander Khazatsky, Christopher D Manning, Chelsea Finn
The Numerical Stability of Hyperbolic Representation Learning	The hyperbolic space is widely used for representing hierarchical datasets due to its ability to embed trees with small distortion. However, this property comes at a price of numerical instability such that training hyperbolic learning models will sometimes lead to catastrophic NaN problems, encountering unrepresentable values in floating point arithmetic. In this work, we analyze the limitations of two popular models for the hyperbolic space, namely, the Poincaré ball and the Lorentz model. We find that, under the 64-bit arithmetic system, the Poincaré ball has a relatively larger capacity than the Lorentz model for correctly representing points. However, the Lorentz model is superior to the Poincaré ball from the perspective of optimization, which we theoretically validate. To address these limitations, we identify one Euclidean parametrization of the hyperbolic space which can alleviate these issues. We further extend this Euclidean parametrization to hyperbolic hyperplanes and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the performance of hyperbolic SVM.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mishne23a	Gal Mishne, Zhengchao Wan, Yusu Wang, Sheng Yang
Optimal Sets and Solution Paths of ReLU Networks	We develop an analytical framework to characterize the set of optimal ReLU neural networks by reformulating the non-convex training problem as a convex program. We show that the global optima of the convex parameterization are given by a polyhedral set and then extend this characterization to the optimal set of the non-convex training objective. Since all stationary points of the ReLU training problem can be represented as optima of sub-sampled convex programs, our work provide a general expression for all critical points of the non-convex objective. We then leverage our results to provide an optimal pruning algorithm for computing minimal networks, establish conditions for the regularization path of ReLU networks to be continuous, and develop sensitivity results for minimal ReLU networks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mishkin23a	Aaron Mishkin, Mert Pilanci
On the Convergence of Gradient Flow on Multi-layer Linear Models	In this paper, we analyze the convergence of gradient flow on a multi-layer linear model with a loss function of the form $f(W_1W_2\cdots W_L)$. We show that when $f$ satisfies the gradient dominance property, proper weight initialization leads to exponential convergence of the gradient flow to a global minimum of the loss. Moreover, the convergence rate depends on two trajectory-specific quantities that are controlled by the weight initialization: the	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/min23d	Hancheng Min, Rene Vidal, Enrique Mallada
An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Nonstationary Bandit Learning	In nonstationary bandit learning problems, the decision-maker must continually gather information and adapt their action selection as the latent state of the environment evolves. In each time period, some latent optimal action maximizes expected reward under the environment state. We view the optimal action sequence as a stochastic process, and take an information-theoretic approach to analyze attainable performance. We bound per-period regret in terms of the entropy rate of the optimal action process. The bound applies to a wide array of problems studied in the literature and reflects the problem's information structure through its information-ratio.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/min23c	Seungki Min, Daniel Russo
Directed Chain Generative Adversarial Networks	Real-world data can be multimodal distributed, e.g., data describing the opinion divergence in a community, the interspike interval distribution of neurons, and the oscillators natural frequencies. Generating multimodal distributed real-world data has become a challenge to existing generative adversarial networks (GANs). For example, it is often observed that Neural SDEs have only demonstrated successfully performance mainly in generating unimodal time series datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel time series generator, named directed chain GANs (DC-GANs), which inserts a time series dataset (called a neighborhood process of the directed chain or input) into the drift and diffusion coefficients of the directed chain SDEs with distributional constraints. DC-GANs can generate new time series of the same distribution as the neighborhood process, and the neighborhood process will provide the key step in learning and generating multimodal distributed time series. The proposed DC-GANs are examined on four datasets, including two stochastic models from social sciences and computational neuroscience, and two real-world datasets on stock prices and energy consumption. To our best knowledge, DC-GANs are the first work that can generate multimodal time series data and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks with respect to measures of distribution, data similarity, and predictive ability.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/min23b	Ming Min, Ruimeng Hu, Tomoyuki Ichiba
Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Asynchronous Communication and Linear Function Approximation	We study multi-agent reinforcement learning in the setting of episodic Markov decision processes, where many agents cooperate via communication through a central server. We propose a provably efficient algorithm based on value iteration that can simultaneously allow asynchronous communication and guarantee the benefit of cooperation with low communication complexity. Under linear function approximation, we prove that our algorithm enjoys a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}H^2\sqrt{K})$ regret upper bound with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(dHM^2)$ communication complexity, where $d$ is the feature dimension, $H$ is the horizon length, $M$ is the total number of agents, and $K$ is the total number of episodes. We also provide a lower bound showing that an $\Omega(dM)$ communication complexity is necessary to improve the performance through collaboration.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/min23a	Yifei Min, Jiafan He, Tianhao Wang, Quanquan Gu
Generative Decoding of Visual Stimuli	Reconstructing natural images from fMRI recordings is a challenging task of great importance in neuroscience. The current architectures are bottlenecked because they fail to effectively capture the hierarchical processing of visual stimuli that takes place in the human brain. Motivated by that fact, we introduce a novel neural network architecture for the problem of neural decoding. Our architecture uses Hierarchical Variational Autoencoders (HVAEs) to learn meaningful representations of natural images and leverages their latent space hierarchy to learn voxel-to-image mappings. By mapping the early stages of the visual pathway to the first set of latent variables and the higher visual cortex areas to the deeper layers in the latent hierarchy, we are able to construct a latent variable neural decoding model that replicates the hierarchical visual information processing. Our model achieves better reconstructions compared to the state of the art and our ablation study indicates that the hierarchical structure of the latent space is responsible for that performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/miliotou23a	Eleni Miliotou, Panagiotis Kyriakis, Jason D Hinman, Andrei Irimia, Paul Bogdan
Learning to acquire novel cognitive tasks with evolution, plasticity and meta-meta-learning	"A hallmark of intelligence is the ability to autonomously learn new flexible, cognitive behaviors - that is, behaviors where the appropriate action depends not just on immediate stimuli (as in simple reflexive stimulus-response associations), but on contextual information that must be adequately acquired, stored and processed. While many meta-learning algorithms can design agents that autonomously learn new tasks, cognitive tasks adds another level of learning and memory to typical ""learning-to-learn"" problems. Here we evolve neural networks, endowed with plastic connections and neuromodulation, over a sizable set of simple cognitive tasks adapted from a computational neuroscience framework. The resulting evolved networks can automatically modify their own connectivity to acquire a novel simple cognitive task, never seen during evolution, from stimuli and rewards alone, through the spontaneous operation of their evolved neural organization and plasticity system. Our results emphasize the importance of carefully considering the multiple learning loops involved in the emergence of intelligent behavior."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/miconi23a	Thomas Miconi
Path Neural Networks: Expressive and Accurate Graph Neural Networks	Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently become the standard approach for learning with graph-structured data. Prior work has shed light into their potential, but also their limitations. Unfortunately, it was shown that standard GNNs are limited in their expressive power. These models are no more powerful than the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) algorithm in terms of distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs. In this paper, we propose Path Neural Networks (PathNNs), a model that updates node representations by aggregating paths emanating from nodes. We derive three different variants of the PathNN model that aggregate single shortest paths, all shortest paths and all simple paths of length up to K. We prove that two of these variants are strictly more powerful than the 1-WL algorithm, and we experimentally validate our theoretical results. We find that PathNNs can distinguish pairs of non-isomorphic graphs that are indistinguishable by 1-WL, while our most expressive PathNN variant can even distinguish between 3-WL indistinguishable graphs. The different PathNN variants are also evaluated on graph classification and graph regression datasets, where in most cases, they outperform the baseline methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/michel23a	Gaspard Michel, Giannis Nikolentzos, Johannes F.

Learning Instance-Specific Augmentations by Capturing Local Invariances	We introduce InstaAug, a method for automatically learning input-specific augmentations from data. Previous methods for learning augmentations have typically assumed independence between the original input and the transformation applied to that input. This can be highly restrictive, as the invariances we hope our augmentation will capture are themselves often highly input dependent. InstaAug instead introduces a learnable invariance module that maps from inputs to tailored transformation parameters, allowing local invariances to be captured. This can be simultaneously trained alongside the downstream model in a fully end-to-end manner, or separately learned for a pre-trained model. We empirically demonstrate that InstaAug learns meaningful input-dependent augmentations for a wide range of transformation classes, which in turn provides better performance on both supervised and self-supervised tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/miao23a	Ning Miao, Tom Rainforth, Emile Mathieu, Yann Dubois, Yee Whye Teh, Adam Foster, Hyunjik Kim
Single Point-Based Distributed Zeroth-Order Optimization with a Non-Convex Stochastic Objective Function	Zero-order (ZO) optimization is a powerful tool for dealing with realistic constraints. On the other hand, the gradient-tracking (GT) technique proved to be an efficient method for distributed optimization aiming to achieve consensus. However, it is a first-order (FO) method that requires knowledge of the gradient, which is not always possible in practice. In this work, we introduce a zero-order distributed optimization method based on a one-point estimate of the gradient tracking technique. We prove that this new technique converges with a single noisy function query at a time in the non-convex setting. We then establish a convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{K}})$ after a number of iterations K, which competes with that of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{K}})$ of its centralized counterparts. Finally, a numerical example validates our theoretical results.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mhanna23a	Elissa Mhanna, Mohamad Assaad
Representation Learning with Multi-Step Inverse Kinematics: An Efficient and Optimal Approach to Rich-Observation RL	We study the design of sample-efficient algorithms for reinforcement learning in the presence of rich, high-dimensional observations, formalized via the Block MDP problem. Existing algorithms suffer from either 1) computational intractability, 2) strong statistical assumptions that are not necessarily satisfied in practice, or 3) suboptimal sample complexity. We address these issues by providing the first computationally efficient algorithm that attains rate-optimal sample complexity with respect to the desired accuracy level, with minimal statistical assumptions. Our algorithm, MusIK, combines exploration with representation learning based on multi-step inverse kinematics, a learning objective in which the aim is to predict the current action from the current observation and observations in the (potentially distant) future. MusIK is simple and flexible, and can efficiently take advantage of general-purpose function approximation. Our analysis of MusIK leverages several new techniques tailored to non-optimistic algorithms for reward-free exploration, which we anticipate will find broader use.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mhammedi23a	Zakaria Mhammedi, Dylan J Foster, Alexander Rakhlin
MANSA: Learning Fast and Slow in Multi-Agent Systems	In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), independent learning (IL) often shows remarkable performance and easily scales with the number of agents. Yet, using IL can be inefficient and runs the risk of failing to successfully train, particularly in scenarios that require agents to coordinate their actions. Using centralised learning (CL) enables MARL agents to quickly learn how to coordinate their behaviour but employing CL everywhere is often prohibitively expensive in real-world applications. Besides, using CL in value-based methods often needs strong representational constraints (e.g. individual-global-max condition) that can lead to poor performance if violated. In this paper, we introduce a novel plug & play IL framework named Multi-Agent Network Selection Algorithm (MANSA) which selectively employs CL only at states that require coordination. At its core, MANSA has an additional agent that uses switching controls to quickly learn the best states to activate CL during training, using CL only where necessary and vastly reducing the computational burden of CL. Our theory proves MANSA preserves cooperative MARL convergence properties, boosts IL performance and can optimally make use of a fixed budget on the number CL calls. We show empirically in Level-based Foraging (LBF) and StarCraft Multi-agent Challenge (SMAC) that MANSA achieves fast, superior and more reliable performance while making 40% fewer CL calls in SMAC and using CL at only 1% CL calls in LBF.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mguni23a	David Henry Mguni, Haojun Chen, Taher Jafferjee, Jianhong Wang, Longfei Yue, Xidong Feng, Stephen Marcus Mcaleer, Feifei Tong, Jun Wang, Yaodong Yang
Training Deep Surrogate Models with Large Scale Online Learning	The spatiotemporal resolution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) plays important roles in the mathematical description of the world's physical phenomena. In general, scientists and engineers solve PDEs numerically by the use of computationally demanding solvers. Recently, deep learning algorithms have emerged as a viable alternative for obtaining fast solutions for PDEs. Models are usually trained on synthetic data generated by solvers, stored on disk and read back for training. This paper advocates that relying on a traditional static dataset to train these models does not allow the full benefit of the solver to be used as a data generator. It proposes an open source online training framework for deep surrogate models. The framework implements several levels of parallelism focused on simultaneously generating numerical simulations and training deep neural networks. This approach suppresses the I/O and storage bottleneck associated with disk-loaded datasets, and opens the way to training on significantly larger datasets. Experiments compare the offline and online training of four surrogate models, including state-of-the-art architectures. Results indicate that exposing deep surrogate models to more dataset diversity, up to hundreds of GB, can increase model generalization capabilities. Fully connected neural networks, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and Message Passing PDE Solver prediction accuracy is improved by 68%, 16% and 7%, respectively.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/meyer23b	Lucas Thibaut Meyer, Marc Schouler, Robert Alexander Caulk, Alejandro Ribes, Bruno Raffin
Quantum Policy Gradient Algorithm with Optimized Action Decoding	Quantum machine learning implemented by variational quantum circuits (VQCs) is considered a promising concept for the noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing era. Focusing on applications in quantum reinforcement learning, we propose an action decoding procedure for a quantum policy gradient approach. We introduce a quality measure that enables us to optimize the classical post-processing required for action selection, inspired by local and global quantum measurements. The resulting algorithm demonstrates a significant performance improvement in several benchmark environments. With this technique, we successfully execute a full training routine on a 5-qubit hardware device. Our method introduces only negligible classical overhead and has the potential to improve VQC-based algorithms beyond the field of quantum reinforcement learning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/meyer23a	Nico Meyer, Daniel Scherer, Axel Plinge, Christopher Mutschler, Michael Hartmann
Towards Theoretical Understanding of Inverse Reinforcement Learning	Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) denotes a powerful family of algorithms for recovering a reward function justifying the behavior demonstrated by an expert agent. A well-known limitation of IRL is the ambiguity in the choice of the reward function, due to the existence of multiple rewards that explain the observed behavior. This limitation has been recently circumvented by formulating IRL as the problem of estimating the feasible reward set, i.e., the region of the rewards compatible with the expert's behavior. In this paper, we make a step towards closing the theory gap of IRL in the case of finite-horizon problems with a generative model. We start by formally introducing the problem of estimating the feasible reward set, the corresponding PAC requirement, and discussing the properties of particular classes of rewards. Then, we provide the first minimax lower bound on the sample complexity for the problem of estimating the feasible reward set of order ${\Omega}\left( \frac{H^3SA}{\epsilon^2} \left( \log \left(\frac{1}{\delta}\right) + S \right)\right)$, being $S$ and $A$ the number of states and actions respectively, $H$ the horizon, $\epsilon$ the desired accuracy, and $\delta$ the confidence. We analyze the sample complexity of a uniform sampling strategy (US-IRL), proving a matching upper bound up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we outline several open questions in IRL and propose future research directions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/metelli23a	Alberto Maria Metelli, Filippo Lazzati, Marcello Restelli
Is Consensus Acceleration Possible in Decentralized Optimization over Slowly Time-Varying Networks?	We consider decentralized optimization problems where one aims to minimize a sum of convex smooth objective functions distributed between nodes in the network. The links in the network can change from time to time. For the setting when the amount of changes is arbitrary, lower complexity bounds and corresponding optimal algorithms are known, and the consensus acceleration is not possible. However, in practice the magnitude of network changes may be limited. We derive lower complexity bounds for several regimes of velocity of networks changes. Moreover, we show how to obtain accelerated communication rates for a certain class of time-varying graphs using a specific consensus algorithm.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/metelev23a	Dmitry Metelev, Alexander Rogozin, Dmitry Kovalev, Alexander Gasnikov
Quantile Credit Assignment	"In reinforcement learning, the credit assignment problem is to distinguish luck from skill, that is, separate the inherent randomness in the environment from the controllable effects of the agent's actions. This paper proposes two novel algorithms, Quantile Credit Assignment (QCA) and Hindsight QCA (HQCA), which incorporate distributional value estimation to perform credit assignment. QCA uses a network that predicts the quantiles of the return distribution, whereas HQCA additionally incorporates information about the future. Both QCA and HQCA have the appealing interpretation of leveraging an estimate of the quantile level of the return (interpreted as the level of ""luck"") in order to derive a ""luck-dependent"" baseline for policy gradient methods. We show theoretically that this approach gives an unbiased policy gradient estimate that can yield significant variance reductions over a standard value estimate baseline. QCA and HQCA significantly outperform prior state-of-the-art methods on a range of extremely difficult credit assignment problems."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mesnard23a	Thomas Mesnard, Wenqi Chen, Alaa Saade, Yunhao Tang, Mark Rowland, Theophane Weber, Clare Lyle, Audrunas Gruslys, Michal Valko, Will Dabney, Georg Ostrovski, Eric Moulines, Remi Munos
On Preemption and Learning in Stochastic Scheduling	We study single-machine scheduling of jobs, each belonging to a job type that determines its duration distribution. We start by analyzing the scenario where the type characteristics are known and then move to two learning scenarios where the types are unknown: non-preemptive problems, where each started job must be completed before moving to another job; and preemptive problems, where job execution can be paused in the favor of moving to a different job. In both cases, we design algorithms that achieve sublinear excess cost, compared to the performance with known types, and prove lower bounds for the non-preemptive case. Notably, we demonstrate, both theoretically and through simulations, how preemptive algorithms can greatly outperform non-preemptive ones when the durations of different job types are far from one another, a phenomenon that does not occur when the type durations are known.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/merlis23a	Nadav Merlis, Hugo Richard, Flore Sentenac, Corentin Odic, Mathieu Molina, Vianney Perchet
Tuning Language Models as Training Data Generators for Augmentation-Enhanced Few-Shot Learning	Recent studies have revealed the intriguing few-shot learning ability of pretrained language models (PLMs): They can quickly adapt to a new task when fine-tuned on a small amount of labeled data formulated as prompts, without requiring abundant task-specific annotations. Despite their promising performance, most existing few-shot approaches that only learn from the small training set still underperform fully supervised training by nontrivial margins. In this work, we study few-shot learning with PLMs from a different perspective: We first tune an autoregressive PLM on the few-shot samples and then use it as a generator to synthesize a large amount of novel training samples which augment the original training set. To encourage the generator to produce label-discriminative samples, we train it via weighted maximum likelihood where the weight of each token is automatically adjusted based on a discriminative meta-learning objective. A classification PLM can then be fine-tuned on both the few-shot and the synthetic samples with regularization for better generalization and stability. Our approach FewGen achieves an overall better result across seven classification tasks of the GLUE benchmark than existing few-shot learning methods, improving no-augmentation methods by 5+ average points, and outperforming augmentation methods by 3+ average points.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/meng23b	Yu Meng, Martin Michalski, Jiaxin Huang, Yu Zhang, Tarek Abdelzaher, Jiawei Han
A Model-Based Method for Minimizing CVaR and Beyond	We develop a variant of the stochastic prox-linear method for minimizing the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) objective. CVaR is a risk measure focused on minimizing worst-case performance, defined as the average of the top quantile of the losses. In machine learning, such a risk measure is useful to train more robust models. Although the stochastic subgradient method (SGM) is a natural choice for minimizing the CVaR objective, we show that our stochastic prox-linear (SPL+) algorithm can better exploit the structure of the objective, while still providing a convenient closed form update. Our SPL+ method also adapts to the scaling of the loss function, which allows for easier tuning. We then specialize a general convergence theorem for SPL+ to our setting, and show that it allows for a wider selection of step sizes compared to SGM. We support this theoretical finding experimentally.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/meng23a	Si Yi Meng, Robert M. Gower
Superhuman Fairness	The fairness of machine learning-based decisions has become an increasingly important focus in the design of supervised machine learning methods. Most fairness approaches optimize a specified trade-off between performance measure(s) (e.g., accuracy, log loss, or AUC) and fairness metric(s) (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds). This begs the question: are the right performance-fairness trade-offs being specified? We instead re-cast fair machine learning as an imitation learning task by introducing superhuman fairness, which seeks to simultaneously outperform human decisions on multiple predictive performance and fairness measures. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach given suboptimal decisions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/memarrast23a	Omid Memarrast, Linh Vu, Brian D Ziebart
Reprogramming Pretrained Language Models for Antibody Sequence Infilling	Antibodies comprise the most versatile class of binding molecules, with numerous applications in biomedicine. Computational design of antibodies involves generating novel and diverse sequences, while maintaining structural consistency. Unique to antibodies, designing the complementarity-determining region (CDR), which determines the antigen binding affinity and specificity, creates its own unique challenges. Recent deep learning models have shown impressive results, however the limited number of known antibody sequence/structure pairs frequently leads to degraded performance, particularly lacking diversity in the generated sequences. In our work we address this challenge by leveraging Model Reprogramming (MR), which repurposes pretrained models on a source language to adapt to the tasks that are in a different language and have scarce data - where it may be difficult to train a high-performing model from scratch or effectively fine-tune an existing pre-trained model on the specific task. Specifically, we introduce ReprogBert in which a pretrained English language model is repurposed for protein sequence infilling - thus considers cross-language adaptation using less data. Results on antibody design benchmarks show that our model on low-resourced antibody sequence dataset provides highly diverse CDR sequences, up to more than a two-fold increase of diversity over the baselines, without losing structural integrity and naturalness. The generated sequences also demonstrate enhanced antigen binding specificity and virus neutralization ability.

Normalizing Flows for Interventional Density Estimation	Existing machine learning methods for causal inference usually estimate quantities expressed via the mean of potential outcomes (e.g., average treatment effect). However, such quantities do not capture the full information about the distribution of potential outcomes. In this work, we estimate the density of potential outcomes after interventions from observational data. For this, we propose a novel, fully-parametric deep learning method called Interventional Normalizing Flows. Specifically, we combine two normalizing flows, namely (i) a nuisance flow for estimating nuisance parameters and (ii) a target flow for parametric estimation of the density of potential outcomes. We further develop a tractable optimization objective based on a one-step bias correction for efficient and doubly robust estimation of the target flow parameters. As a result, our Interventional Normalizing Flows offer a properly normalized density estimator. Across various experiments, we demonstrate that our Interventional Normalizing Flows are expressive and highly effective, and scale well with both sample size and high-dimensional confounding. To the best of our knowledge, our Interventional Normalizing Flows are the first proper fully-parametric, deep learning method for density estimation of potential outcomes.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/melnychuk23a	Valentyn Melnychuk, Dennis Frauen, Stefan Feuerriegel
Stochastic Gradient Succeeds for Bandits	"We show that the stochastic gradient bandit algorithm converges to a globally optimal policy at an $O(1/t)$ rate, even with a constant step size. Remarkably, global convergence of the stochastic gradient bandit algorithm has not been previously established, even though it is an old algorithm known to be applicable to bandits. The new result is achieved by establishing two novel technical findings: first, the noise of the stochastic updates in the gradient bandit algorithm satisfies a strong ""growth condition"" property, where the variance diminishes whenever progress becomes small, implying that additional noise control via diminishing step sizes is unnecessary; second, a form of ""weak exploration"" is automatically achieved through the stochastic gradient updates, since they prevent the action probabilities from decaying faster than $O(1/t)$, thus ensuring that every action is sampled infinitely often with probability $1$. These two findings can be used to show that the stochastic gradient update is already ""sufficient"" for bandits in the sense that exploration versus exploitation is automatically balanced in a manner that ensures almost sure convergence to a global optimum. These novel theoretical findings are further verified by experimental results."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mei23a	Jincheng Mei, Zixin Zhong, Bo Dai, Alekh Agarwal, Csaba Szepesvari, Dale Schuurmans
A Model-free Closeness-of-influence Test for Features in Supervised Learning	Understanding the effect of a feature vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^d$ on the response value (label) $y\in \mathbb{R}$ is the cornerstone of many statistical learning problems. Ideally, it is desired to understand how a set of collected features combine together and influence the response value, but this problem is notoriously difficult, due to the high-dimensionality of data and limited number of labeled data points, among many others. In this work, we take a new perspective on this problem, and we study the question of assessing the difference of influence that the two given features have on the response value. We first propose a notion of closeness for the influence of features, and show that our definition recovers the familiar notion of the magnitude of coefficients in the parametric model. We then propose a novel method to test for the closeness of influence in general model-free supervised learning problems. Our proposed test can be used with finite number of samples with control on type I error rate, no matter the ground truth conditional law $\mathcal{L}(Y|X)$. We analyze the power of our test for two general learning problems i) linear regression, and ii) binary classification under mixture of Gaussian models, and show that under the proper choice of score function, an internal component of our test, with sufficient number of samples will achieve full statistical power. We evaluate our findings through extensive numerical simulations, specifically we adopt the datamodel framework (Ilyas, et al., 2022) for CIFAR-10 dataset to identify pairs of training samples with different influence on the trained model via optional black box training mechanisms.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mehrabi23a	Mohammad Mehrabi, Ryan A.

Robustness in Multimodal Learning under Train-Test Modality Mismatch	Multimodal learning is defined as learning over multiple heterogeneous input modalities such as video, audio, and text. In this work, we are concerned with understanding how models behave as the type of modalities differ between training and deployment, a situation that naturally arises in many applications of multimodal learning to hardware platforms. We present a multimodal robustness framework to provide a systematic analysis of common multimodal representation learning methods. Further, we identify robustness short-comings of these approaches and propose two intervention techniques leading to $1.5\times$-$4\times$ robustness improvements on three datasets, AudioSet, Kinetics-400 and ImageNet-Captions. Finally, we demonstrate that these interventions better utilize additional modalities, if present, to achieve competitive results of $44.2$ mAP on AudioSet 20K.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mckinzie23a	Brandon Mckinzie, Vaishaal Shankar, Joseph Yitan Cheng, Yinfei Yang, Jonathon Shlens, Alexander T Toshev
PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bounds for Adversarial Generative Models	We extend PAC-Bayesian theory to generative models and develop generalization bounds for models based on the Wasserstein distance and the total variation distance. Our first result on the Wasserstein distance assumes the instance space is bounded, while our second result takes advantage of dimensionality reduction. Our results naturally apply to Wasserstein GANs and Energy-Based GANs, and our bounds provide new training objectives for these two. Although our work is mainly theoretical, we perform numerical experiments showing non-vacuous generalization bounds for Wasserstein GANs on synthetic datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mbacke23a	Sokhna Diarra Mbacke, Florence Clerc, Pascal Germain
Nonparametric Density Estimation under Distribution Drift	We study nonparametric density estimation in non-stationary drift settings. Given a sequence of independent samples taken from a distribution that gradually changes in time, the goal is to compute the best estimate for the current distribution. We prove tight minimax risk bounds for both discrete and continuous smooth densities, where the minimum is over all possible estimates and the maximum is over all possible distributions that satisfy the drift constraints. Our technique handles a broad class of drift models and generalizes previous results on agnostic learning under drift.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mazzetto23a	Alessio Mazzetto, Eli Upfal
Communication-Constrained Bandits under Additive Gaussian Noise	We study a distributed stochastic multi-armed bandit where a client supplies the learner with communication-constrained feedback based on the rewards for the corresponding arm pulls. In our setup, the client must encode the rewards such that the second moment of the encoded rewards is no more than $P$, and this encoded reward is further corrupted by additive Gaussian noise of variance $\sigma^2$; the learner only has access to this corrupted reward. For this setting, we derive an information-theoretic lower bound of $\Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{KT}{\mathtt{SNR} \wedge1}} \right)$ on the minimax regret of any scheme, where $\mathtt{SNR}\coloneqq \frac{P}{\sigma^2}$, and $K$ and $T$ are the number of arms and time horizon, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a multi-phase bandit algorithm, $\mathtt{UE}\text{-}\mathtt{UCB}\text{++}$, which matches this lower bound to a minor additive factor. $\mathtt{UE}\text{-}\mathtt{UCB}\text{++}$ performs uniform exploration in its initial phases and then utilizes the	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mayekar23a	Prathamesh Mayekar, Jonathan Scarlett, Vincent Y.

Multi-Fidelity Covariance Estimation in the Log-Euclidean Geometry	We introduce a multi-fidelity estimator of covariance matrices that employs the log-Euclidean geometry of the symmetric positive-definite manifold. The estimator fuses samples from a hierarchy of data sources of differing fidelities and costs for variance reduction while guaranteeing definiteness, in contrast with previous approaches. The new estimator makes covariance estimation tractable in applications where simulation or data collection is expensive; to that end, we develop an optimal sample allocation scheme that minimizes the mean-squared error of the estimator given a fixed budget. Guaranteed definiteness is crucial to metric learning, data assimilation, and other downstream tasks. Evaluations of our approach using data from physical applications (heat conduction, fluid dynamics) demonstrate more accurate metric learning and speedups of more than one order of magnitude compared to benchmarks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/maurais23a	Aimee Maurais, Terrence Alsup, Benjamin Peherstorfer, Youssef Marzouk
Improved Policy Evaluation for Randomized Trials of Algorithmic Resource Allocation	We consider the task of evaluating policies of algorithmic resource allocation through randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Such policies are tasked with optimizing the utilization of limited intervention resources, with the goal of maximizing the benefits derived. Evaluation of such allocation policies through RCTs proves difficult, notwithstanding the scale of the trial, because the individuals' outcomes are inextricably interlinked through resource constraints controlling the policy decisions. Our key contribution is to present a new estimator leveraging our proposed novel concept, that involves retrospective reshuffling of participants across experimental arms at the end of an RCT. We identify conditions under which such reassignments are permissible and can be leveraged to construct counterfactual trials, whose outcomes can be accurately ascertained, for free. We prove theoretically that such an estimator is more accurate than common estimators based on sample means – we show that it returns an unbiased estimate and simultaneously reduces variance. We demonstrate the value of our approach through empirical experiments on synthetic, semisynthetic as well as real case study data and show improved estimation accuracy across the board.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mate23a	Aditya Mate, Bryan Wilder, Aparna Taneja, Milind Tambe
Generative Pretraining for Black-Box Optimization	Many problems in science and engineering involve optimizing an expensive black-box function over a high-dimensional space. In the offline model-based optimization (MBO) setting, we assume access to a fixed, offline dataset for pretraining and a small budget for online function evaluations. Prior approaches seek to utilize the offline data to approximate the function or its inverse but are not sufficiently accurate far from the data distribution. We propose BONET, a generative framework for pretraining a novel model-based optimizer using offline datasets. In BONET, we train an autoregressive model on fixed-length trajectories derived from an offline dataset. We design a sampling strategy to synthesize trajectories from offline data using a simple heuristic of rolling out monotonic transitions from low-fidelity to high-fidelity samples. Empirically, we instantiate BONET using a causally masked Transformer (Radford et al., 2019) and evaluate it on Design-Bench (Trabucco et al., 2022), where we rank the best on average, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mashkaria23a	Satvik Mehul Mashkaria, Siddarth Krishnamoorthy, Aditya Grover
Neural Network Approximations of PDEs Beyond Linearity: A Representational Perspective	A burgeoning line of research has developed deep neural networks capable of approximating the solutions to high dimensional PDEs, opening related lines of theoretical inquiry focused on explaining how it is that these models appear to evade the curse of dimensionality.

In this work, we take a step towards studying the representational power of neural networks for approximating solutions to nonlinear PDEs.

Computational Asymmetries in Robust Classification	In the context of adversarial robustness, we make three strongly related contributions. First, we prove that while attacking ReLU classifiers is $\mathit{NP}$-hard, ensuring their robustness at training time is $\Sigma^2_P$-hard (even on a single example). This asymmetry provides a rationale for the fact that robust classifications approaches are frequently fooled in the literature. Second, we show that inference-time robustness certificates are not affected by this asymmetry, by introducing a proof-of-concept approach named Counter-Attack (CA). Indeed, CA displays a reversed asymmetry: running the defense is $\mathit{NP}$-hard, while attacking it is $\Sigma_2^P$-hard. Finally, motivated by our previous result, we argue that adversarial attacks can be used in the context of robustness certification, and provide an empirical evaluation of their effectiveness. As a byproduct of this process, we also release UG100, a benchmark dataset for adversarial attacks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/marro23a	Samuele Marro, Michele Lombardi
Efficient Transformed Gaussian Processes for Non-Stationary Dependent Multi-class Classification	This work introduces the Efficient Transformed Gaussian Process (ETGP), a new way of creating $C$ stochastic processes characterized by: 1) the $C$ processes are non-stationary, 2) the $C$ processes are dependent by construction without needing a mixing matrix, 3) training and making predictions is very efficient since the number of Gaussian Processes (GP) operations (e.g. inverting the inducing point's covariance matrix) do not depend on the number of processes. This makes the ETGP particularly suited for multi-class problems with a very large number of classes, which are the problems studied in this work. ETGP exploits the recently proposed Transformed Gaussian Process (TGP), a stochastic process specified by transforming a Gaussian Process using an invertible transformation. However, unlike TGP, ETGP is constructed by transforming a single sample from a GP using $C$ invertible transformations. We derive an efficient sparse variational inference algorithm for the proposed model and demonstrate its utility in 5 classification tasks which include low/medium/large datasets and a different number of classes, ranging from just a few to hundreds. Our results show that ETGP, in general, outperforms state-of-the-art methods for multi-class classification based on GPs, and has a lower computational cost (around one order of magnitude smaller).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/maronas23a	Juan Maroñas, Daniel Hernández-Lobato
Quantized Distributed Training of Large Models with Convergence Guarantees	Communication-reduction techniques are a popular way to improve scalability in data-parallel training of deep neural networks (DNNs). The recent emergence of large language models such as GPT has created the need for new approaches to exploit data-parallelism. Among these, fully-sharded data parallel (FSDP) training is highly popular, yet it still encounters scalability bottlenecks. One reason is that applying compression techniques to FSDP is challenging: as the vast majority of the communication involves the model's weights, direct compression alters convergence and leads to accuracy loss. We present QSDP, a variant of FSDP which supports both gradient and weight quantization with theoretical guarantees, is simple to implement and has essentially no overheads. To derive QSDP we prove that a natural modification of SGD achieves convergence even when we only maintain quantized weights, and thus the domain over which we train consists of quantized points and is, therefore, highly non-convex. We validate this approach by training GPT-family models with up to 1.3 billion parameters on a multi-node cluster. Experiments show that QSDP preserves model accuracy, while completely removing the communication bottlenecks of FSDP, providing end-to-end speedups of up to 2.2x.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/markov23a	Ilia Markov, Adrian Vladu, Qi Guo, Dan Alistarh
Analyzing Diffusion as Serial Reproduction	Diffusion models are a class of generative models that learn to synthesize samples by inverting a diffusion process that gradually maps data into noise. While these models have enjoyed great success recently, a full theoretical understanding of their observed properties is still lacking, in particular, their weak sensitivity to the choice of noise family and the role of adequate scheduling of noise levels for good synthesis. By identifying a correspondence between diffusion models and a well-known paradigm in cognitive science known as serial reproduction, whereby human agents iteratively observe and reproduce stimuli from memory, we show how the aforementioned properties of diffusion models can be explained as a natural consequence of this correspondence. We then complement our theoretical analysis with simulations that exhibit these key features. Our work highlights how classic paradigms in cognitive science can shed light on state-of-the-art machine learning problems.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/marjieh23a	Raja Marjieh, Ilia Sucholutsky, Thomas A Langlois, Nori Jacoby, Thomas L.

Regions of Reliability in the Evaluation of Multivariate Probabilistic Forecasts	"Multivariate probabilistic time series forecasts are commonly evaluated via proper scoring rules, i.e., functions that are minimal in expectation for the ground-truth distribution. However, this property is not sufficient to guarantee good discrimination in the non-asymptotic regime. In this paper, we provide the first systematic finite-sample study of proper scoring rules for time series forecasting evaluation. Through a power analysis, we identify the ""region of reliability"" of a scoring rule, i.e., the set of practical conditions where it can be relied on to identify forecasting errors. We carry out our analysis on a comprehensive synthetic benchmark, specifically designed to test several key discrepancies between ground-truth and forecast distributions, and we gauge the generalizability of our findings to real-world tasks with an application to an electricity production problem. Our results reveal critical shortcomings in the evaluation of multivariate probabilistic forecasts as commonly performed in the literature."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/marcotte23a	Étienne Marcotte, Valentina Zantedeschi, Alexandre Drouin, Nicolas Chapados
Evaluating Unsupervised Denoising Requires Unsupervised Metrics	Unsupervised denoising is a crucial challenge in real-world imaging applications. Unsupervised deep-learning methods have demonstrated impressive performance on benchmarks based on synthetic noise. However, no metrics exist to evaluate these methods in an unsupervised fashion. This is highly problematic for the many practical applications where ground-truth clean images are not available. In this work, we propose two novel metrics: the unsupervised mean squared error (MSE) and the unsupervised peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), which are computed using only noisy data. We provide a theoretical analysis of these metrics, showing that they are asymptotically consistent estimators of the supervised MSE and PSNR. Controlled numerical experiments with synthetic noise confirm that they provide accurate approximations in practice. We validate our approach on real-world data from two imaging modalities: videos in raw format and transmission electron microscopy. Our results demonstrate that the proposed metrics enable unsupervised evaluation of denoising methods based exclusively on noisy data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/marcos-morales23a	Adria Marcos Morales, Matan Leibovich, Sreyas Mohan, Joshua Lawrence Vincent, Piyush Haluai, Mai Tan, Peter Crozier, Carlos Fernandez-Granda
Neuro-Symbolic Continual Learning: Knowledge, Reasoning Shortcuts and Concept Rehearsal	We introduce Neuro-Symbolic Continual Learning, where a model has to solve a sequence of neuro-symbolic tasks, that is, it has to map sub-symbolic inputs to high-level concepts and compute predictions by reasoning consistently with prior knowledge. Our key observation is that neuro-symbolic tasks, although different, often share concepts whose semantics remains stable over time. Traditional approaches fall short: existing continual strategies ignore knowledge altogether, while stock neuro-symbolic architectures suffer from catastrophic forgetting. We show that leveraging prior knowledge by combining neuro-symbolic architectures with continual strategies does help avoid catastrophic forgetting, but also that doing so can yield models affected by reasoning shortcuts. These undermine the semantics of the acquired concepts, even when detailed prior knowledge is provided upfront and inference is exact, and in turn continual performance. To overcome these issues, we introduce COOL, a COncept-level cOntinual Learning strategy tailored for neuro-symbolic continual problems that acquires high-quality concepts and remembers them over time. Our experiments on three novel benchmarks highlights how COOL attains sustained high performance on neuro-symbolic continual learning tasks in which other strategies fail.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/marconato23a	Emanuele Marconato, Gianpaolo Bontempo, Elisa Ficarra, Simone Calderara, Andrea Passerini, Stefano Teso
SRATTA: Sample Re-ATTribution Attack of Secure Aggregation in Federated Learning.	We consider a federated learning (FL) setting where a machine learning model with a fully connected first layer is trained between different clients and a central server using FedAvg, and where the aggregation step can be performed with secure aggregation (SA). We present SRATTA an attack relying only on aggregated models which, under realistic assumptions, (i) recovers data samples from the different clients, and (ii) groups data samples coming from the same client together. While sample recovery has already been explored in an FL setting, the ability to group samples per client, despite the use of SA, is novel. This poses a significant unforeseen security threat to FL and effectively breaks SA. We show that SRATTA is both theoretically grounded and can be used in practice on realistic models and datasets. We also propose counter-measures, and claim that clients should play an active role to guarantee their privacy during training.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/marchand23a	Tanguy Marchand, Regis Loeb, Ulysse Marteau-Ferey, Jean Ogier Du Terrail, Arthur Pignet
Reliable Measures of Spread in High Dimensional Latent Spaces	Understanding geometric properties of the latent spaces of natural language processing models allows the manipulation of these properties for improved performance on downstream tasks. One such property is the amount of data spread in a model's latent space, or how fully the available latent space is being used. We demonstrate that the commonly used measures of data spread, average cosine similarity and a partition function min/max ratio I(V), do not provide reliable metrics to compare the use of latent space across data distributions. We propose and examine six alternative measures of data spread, all of which improve over these current metrics when applied to seven synthetic data distributions. Of our proposed measures, we recommend one principal component-based measure and one entropy-based measure that provide reliable, relative measures of spread and can be used to compare models of different sizes and dimensionalities.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/marbut23a	Anna Marbut, Katy Mckinney-Bock, Travis Wheeler
Robust Perception through Equivariance	Deep networks for computer vision are not reliable when they encounter adversarial examples. In this paper, we introduce a framework that uses the dense intrinsic constraints in natural images to robustify inference. By introducing constraints at inference time, we can shift the burden of robustness from training to testing, thereby allowing the model to dynamically adjust to each individual image's unique and potentially novel characteristics at inference time. Our theoretical results show the importance of having dense constraints at inference time. In contrast to existing single-constraint methods, we propose to use equivariance, which naturally allows dense constraints at a fine-grained level in the feature space. Our empirical experiments show that restoring feature equivariance at inference time defends against worst-case adversarial perturbations. The method obtains improved adversarial robustness on four datasets (ImageNet, Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC, and MS-COCO) on image recognition, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mao23d	Chengzhi Mao, Lingyu Zhang, Abhishek Vaibhav Joshi, Junfeng Yang, Hao Wang, Carl Vondrick
Supported Trust Region Optimization for Offline Reinforcement Learning	Offline reinforcement learning suffers from the out-of-distribution issue and extrapolation error. Most policy constraint methods regularize the density of the trained policy towards the behavior policy, which is too restrictive in most cases. We propose Supported Trust Region optimization (STR) which performs trust region policy optimization with the policy constrained within the support of the behavior policy, enjoying the less restrictive support constraint. We show that, when assuming no approximation and sampling error, STR guarantees strict policy improvement until convergence to the optimal support-constrained policy in the dataset. Further with both errors incorporated, STR still guarantees safe policy improvement for each step. Empirical results validate the theory of STR and demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance on MuJoCo locomotion domains and much more challenging AntMaze domains.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mao23c	Yixiu Mao, Hongchang Zhang, Chen Chen, Yi Xu, Xiangyang Ji

Differential Privacy has Bounded Impact on Fairness in Classification	We theoretically study the impact of differential privacy on fairness in classification. We prove that, given a class of models, popular group fairness measures are pointwise Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the parameters of the model. This result is a consequence of a more general statement on accuracy conditioned on an arbitrary event (such as membership to a sensitive group), which may be of independent interest. We use this Lipschitz property to prove a non-asymptotic bound showing that, as the number of samples increases, the fairness level of private models gets closer to the one of their non-private counterparts. This bound also highlights the importance of the confidence margin of a model on the disparate impact of differential privacy.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mangold23a	Paul Mangold, Michaël Perrot, Aurélien Bellet, Marc Tommasi
Performative Reinforcement Learning	We introduce the framework of performative reinforcement learning where the policy chosen by the learner affects the underlying reward and transition dynamics of the environment. Following the recent literature on performative prediction (Perdomo et al., 2020), we introduce the concept of performatively stable policy. We then consider a regularized version of the reinforcement learning problem and show that repeatedly optimizing this objective converges to a performatively stable policy under reasonable assumptions on the transition dynamics. Our proof utilizes the dual perspective of the reinforcement learning problem and may be of independent interest in analyzing the convergence of other algorithms with decision-dependent environments. We then extend our results for the setting where the learner just performs gradient ascent steps instead of fully optimizing the objective, and for the setting where the learner has access to a finite number of trajectories from the changed environment. For both the settings, we leverage the dual formulation of performative reinforcement learning, and establish convergence to a stable solution. Finally, through extensive experiments on a grid-world environment, we demonstrate the dependence of convergence on various parameters e.g. regularization, smoothness, and the number of samples.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mandal23a	Debmalya Mandal, Stelios Triantafyllou, Goran Radanovic
A Kernel-Based View of Language Model Fine-Tuning	It has become standard to solve NLP tasks by fine-tuning pre-trained language models (LMs), especially in low-data settings. There is minimal theoretical understanding of empirical success, e.g., why fine-tuning a model with $10^8$ or more parameters on a couple dozen training points does not result in overfitting. We investigate whether the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)—which originated as a model to study the gradient descent dynamics of infinitely wide networks with suitable random initialization—describes fine-tuning of pre-trained LMs. This study was inspired by the decent performance of NTK for computer vision tasks (Wei et al., 2022). We extend the NTK formalism to Adam and use Tensor Programs (Yang, 2020) to characterize conditions under which the NTK lens may describe fine-tuning updates to pre-trained language models. Extensive experiments on 14 NLP tasks validate our theory and show that formulating the downstream task as a masked word prediction problem through prompting often induces kernel-based dynamics during fine-tuning. Finally, we use this kernel view to propose an explanation for the success of parameter-efficient subspace-based fine-tuning methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/malladi23a	Sadhika Malladi, Alexander Wettig, Dingli Yu, Danqi Chen, Sanjeev Arora
Weighted Tallying Bandits: Overcoming Intractability via Repeated Exposure Optimality	In human-interactive applications of online learning, a human's preferences or abilities are often a function of the algorithm's recent actions. Motivated by this, a significant line of work has formalized settings where an action's loss is a function of the number of times it was played in the prior $m$ timesteps, where $m$ corresponds to a bound on human memory capacity. To more faithfully capture decay of human memory with time, we introduce the Weighted Tallying Bandit (WTB), which generalizes this setting by requiring that an action's loss is a function of a	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/malik23a	Dhruv Malik, Conor Igoe, Yuanzhi Li, Aarti Singh
Additive Causal Bandits with Unknown Graph	We explore algorithms to select actions in the causal bandit setting where the learner can choose to intervene on a set of random variables related by a causal graph, and the learner sequentially chooses interventions and observes a sample from the interventional distribution. The learner's goal is to quickly find the intervention, among all interventions on observable variables, that maximizes the expectation of an outcome variable. We depart from previous literature by assuming no knowledge of the causal graph except that latent confounders between the outcome and its ancestors are not present. We first show that the unknown graph problem can be exponentially hard in the parents of the outcome. To remedy this, we adopt an additional additive assumption on the outcome which allows us to solve the problem by casting it as an additive combinatorial linear bandit problem with full-bandit feedback. We propose a novel action-elimination algorithm for this setting, show how to apply this algorithm to the causal bandit problem, provide sample complexity bounds, and empirically validate our findings on a suite of randomly generated causal models, effectively showing that one does not need to explicitly learn the parents of the outcome to identify the best intervention.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/malek23a	Alan Malek, Virginia Aglietti, Silvia Chiappa
Fundamental Tradeoffs in Learning with Prior Information	We seek to understand fundamental tradeoffs between the accuracy of prior information that a learner has on a given problem and its learning performance. We introduce the notion of prioritized risk, which differs from traditional notions of minimax and Bayes risk by allowing us to study such fundamental tradeoffs in settings where reality does not necessarily conform to the learner's prior. We present a general reduction-based approach for extending classical minimax lower-bound techniques in order to lower bound the prioritized risk for statistical estimation problems. We also introduce a novel generalization of Fano's inequality (which may be of independent interest) for lower bounding the prioritized risk in more general settings involving unbounded losses.

Vertical Federated Graph Neural Network for Recommender System	Conventional recommender systems are required to train the recommendation model using a centralized database. However, due to data privacy concerns, this is often impractical when multi-parties are involved in recommender system training. Federated learning appears as an excellent solution to the data isolation and privacy problem. Recently, Graph neural network (GNN) is becoming a promising approach for federated recommender systems. However, a key challenge is to conduct embedding propagation while preserving the privacy of the graph structure. Few studies have been conducted on the federated GNN-based recommender system. Our study proposes the first vertical federated GNN-based recommender system, called VerFedGNN. We design a framework to transmit: (i) the summation of neighbor embeddings using random projection, and (ii) gradients of public parameter perturbed by ternary quantization mechanism. Empirical studies show that VerFedGNN has competitive prediction accuracy with existing privacy preserving GNN frameworks while enhanced privacy protection for users' interaction information.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mai23b	Peihua Mai, Yan Pang
CSP: Self-Supervised Contrastive Spatial Pre-Training for Geospatial-Visual Representations	Geo-tagged images are publicly available in large quantities, whereas labels such as object classes are rather scarce and expensive to collect. Meanwhile, contrastive learning has achieved tremendous success in various natural image and language tasks with limited labeled data. However, existing methods fail to fully leverage geospatial information, which can be paramount to distinguishing objects that are visually similar. To directly leverage the abundant geospatial information associated with images in pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference stages, we present Contrastive Spatial Pre-Training (CSP), a self-supervised learning framework for geo-tagged images. We use a dual-encoder to separately encode the images and their corresponding geo-locations, and use contrastive objectives to learn effective location representations from images, which can be transferred to downstream supervised tasks such as image classification. Experiments show that CSP can improve model performance on both iNat2018 and fMoW datasets. Especially, on iNat2018, CSP significantly boosts the model performance with 10-34% relative improvement with various labeled training data sampling ratios.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/mai23a	Gengchen Mai, Ni Lao, Yutong He, Jiaming Song, Stefano Ermon
Applied Online Algorithms with Heterogeneous Predictors	For many application domains, the integration of machine learning (ML) models into decision making is hindered by the poor explainability and theoretical guarantees of black box models. Although the emerging area of algorithms with predictions offers a way to leverage ML while enjoying worst-case guarantees, existing work usually assumes access to only one predictor. We demonstrate how to more effectively utilize historical datasets and application domain knowledge by intentionally using predictors of	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/maghakian23a	Jessica Maghakian, Russell Lee, Mohammad Hajiesmaili, Jian Li, Ramesh Sitaraman, Zhenhua Liu
Learning GFlowNets From Partial Episodes For Improved Convergence And Stability	Generative flow networks (GFlowNets) are a family of algorithms for training a sequential sampler of discrete objects under an unnormalized target density and have been successfully used for various probabilistic modeling tasks. Existing training objectives for GFlowNets are either local to states or transitions, or propagate a reward signal over an entire sampling trajectory. We argue that these alternatives represent opposite ends of a gradient bias-variance tradeoff and propose a way to exploit this tradeoff to mitigate its harmful effects. Inspired by the TD($\lambda$) algorithm in reinforcement learning, we introduce	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/madan23a	Kanika Madan, Jarrid Rector-Brooks, Maksym Korablyov, Emmanuel Bengio, Moksh Jain, Andrei Cristian Nica, Tom Bosc, Yoshua Bengio, Nikolay Malkin
AutoCoreset: An Automatic Practical Coreset Construction Framework	"A coreset is a small weighted subset of an input set that approximates its loss function, for a given set of queries. Coresets became prevalent in machine learning as they have shown to be advantageous for many applications. Unfortunately, coresets are constructed in a problem-dependent manner, where for each problem, a new coreset construction algorithm is suggested, taking years to prove its correctness. Even the generic frameworks require additional (problem-dependent) computations or proofs to be done by the user. Besides, many problems do not have (provable) small coresets, limiting their applicability. To this end, we suggest an automatic practical framework for constructing coresets, which requires (only) the input data and the desired cost function from the user, without the need for any other task-related computation to be done by the user. To do so, we reduce the problem of approximating a loss function to an instance of vector summation approximation, where the vectors we aim to sum are loss vectors of a specific subset of the queries, such that we aim to approximate the image of the function on this subset. We show that while this set is limited, the coreset is quite general. An extensive experimental study on various machine learning applications is also conducted. Finally, we provide a ""plug and play"" style implementation, proposing a user-friendly system that can be easily used to apply coresets for many problems. We believe that these contributions enable future research and easier use and applications of coresets."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/maalouf23a	Alaa Maalouf, Murad Tukan, Vladimir Braverman, Daniela Rus
Calibrating Multimodal Learning	Multimodal machine learning has achieved remarkable progress in a wide range of scenarios. However, the reliability of multimodal learning remains largely unexplored. In this paper, through extensive empirical studies, we identify current multimodal classification methods suffer from unreliable predictive confidence that tend to rely on partial modalities when estimating confidence. Specifically, we find that the confidence estimated by current models could even increase when some modalities are corrupted. To address the issue, we introduce an intuitive principle for multimodal learning, i.e., the confidence should not increase when one modality is removed. Accordingly, we propose a novel regularization technique, i.e., Calibrating Multimodal Learning (CML) regularization, to calibrate the predictive confidence of previous methods. This technique could be flexibly equipped by existing models and improve the performance in terms of confidence calibration, classification accuracy, and model robustness.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ma23i	Huan Ma, Qingyang Zhang, Changqing Zhang, Bingzhe Wu, Huazhu Fu, Joey Tianyi Zhou, Qinghua Hu
Generated Graph Detection	Graph generative models become increasingly effective for data distribution approximation and data augmentation. While they have aroused public concerns about their malicious misuses or misinformation broadcasts, just as what Deepfake visual and auditory media has been delivering to society. Hence it is essential to regulate the prevalence of generated graphs. To tackle this problem, we pioneer the formulation of the generated graph detection problem to distinguish generated graphs from real ones. We propose the first framework to systematically investigate a set of sophisticated models and their performance in four classification scenarios. Each scenario switches between seen and unseen datasets/generators during testing to get closer to real-world settings and progressively challenge the classifiers. Extensive experiments evidence that all the models are qualified for generated graph detection, with specific models having advantages in specific scenarios. Resulting from the validated generality and oblivion of the classifiers to unseen datasets/generators, we draw a safe conclusion that our solution can sustain for a decent while to curb generated graph misuses.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ma23h	Yihan Ma, Zhikun Zhang, Ning Yu, Xinlei He, Michael Backes, Yun Shen, Yang Zhang
Buying Information for Stochastic Optimization	Stochastic optimization is one of the central problems in Machine Learning and Theoretical Computer Science. In the standard model, the algorithm is given a fixed distribution known in advance. In practice though, one may acquire at a cost extra information to make better decisions. In this paper, we study how to buy information for stochastic optimization and formulate this question as an online learning problem. Assuming the learner has an oracle for the original optimization problem, we design a $2$-competitive deterministic algorithm and a $e/(e-1)$-competitive randomized algorithm for buying information. We show that this ratio is tight as the problem is equivalent to a robust generalization of the ski-rental problem, which we call super-martingale stopping. We also consider an adaptive setting where the learner can choose to buy information after taking some actions for the underlying optimization problem. We focus on the classic optimization problem, Min-Sum Set Cover, where the goal is to quickly find an action that covers a given request drawn from a known distribution. We provide an $8$-competitive algorithm running in polynomial time that chooses actions and decides when to buy information about the underlying request.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ma23g	Mingchen Ma, Christos Tzamos
Over-parametrization via Lifting for Low-rank Matrix Sensing: Conversion of Spurious Solutions to Strict Saddle Points	This paper studies the role of over-parametrization in solving non-convex optimization problems. The focus is on the important class of low-rank matrix sensing, where we propose an infinite hierarchy of non-convex problems via the lifting technique and the Burer-Monteiro factorization. This contrasts with the existing over-parametrization technique where the search rank is limited by the dimension of the matrix and it does not allow a rich over-parametrization of an arbitrary degree. We show that although the spurious solutions of the problem remain stationary points through the hierarchy, they will be transformed into strict saddle points (under some technical conditions) and can be escaped via local search methods. This is the first result in the literature showing that over-parametrization creates a negative curvature for escaping spurious solutions. We also derive a bound on how much over-parametrization is requited to enable the elimination of spurious solutions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ma23f	Ziye Ma, Igor Molybog, Javad Lavaei, Somayeh Sojoudi
Learning Intuitive Policies Using Action Features	An unaddressed challenge in multi-agent coordination is to enable AI agents to exploit the semantic relationships between the features of actions and the features of observations. Humans take advantage of these relationships in highly intuitive ways. For instance, in the absence of a shared language, we might point to the object we desire or hold up our fingers to indicate how many objects we want. To address this challenge, we investigate the effect of network architecture on the propensity of learning algorithms to exploit these semantic relationships. Across a procedurally generated coordination task, we find that attention-based architectures that jointly process a featurized representation of observations and actions have a better inductive bias for learning intuitive policies. Through fine-grained evaluation and scenario analysis, we show that the resulting policies are human-interpretable. Moreover, such agents coordinate with people without training on any human data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ma23e	Mingwei Ma, Jizhou Liu, Samuel Sokota, Max Kleiman-Weiner, Jakob Nicolaus Foerster
Learning Signed Distance Functions from Noisy 3D Point Clouds via Noise to Noise Mapping	Learning signed distance functions (SDFs) from 3D point clouds is an important task in 3D computer vision. However, without ground truth signed distances, point normals or clean point clouds, current methods still struggle from learning SDFs from noisy point clouds. To overcome this challenge, we propose to learn SDFs via a noise to noise mapping, which does not require any clean point cloud or ground truth supervision for training. Our novelty lies in the noise to noise mapping which can infer a highly accurate SDF of a single object or scene from its multiple or even single noisy point cloud observations. Our novel learning manner is supported by modern Lidar systems which capture multiple noisy observations per second. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables statistical reasoning on point clouds and maintains geometric consistency although point clouds are irregular, unordered and have no point correspondence among noisy observations. Our evaluation under the widely used benchmarks demonstrates our superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in surface reconstruction, point cloud denoising and upsampling. Our code, data, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/mabaorui/Noise2NoiseMapping/ .	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ma23d	Baorui Ma, Yu-Shen Liu, Zhizhong Han
Graph Inductive Biases in Transformers without Message Passing	Transformers for graph data are increasingly widely studied and successful in numerous learning tasks. Graph inductive biases are crucial for Graph Transformers, and previous works incorporate them using message-passing modules and/or positional encodings. However, Graph Transformers that use message-passing inherit known issues of message-passing, and differ significantly from Transformers used in other domains, thus making transfer of research advances more difficult. On the other hand, Graph Transformers without message-passing often perform poorly on smaller datasets, where inductive biases are more crucial. To bridge this gap, we propose the Graph Inductive bias Transformer (GRIT) — a new Graph Transformer that incorporates graph inductive biases without using message passing. GRIT is based on several architectural changes that are each theoretically and empirically justified, including: learned relative positional encodings initialized with random walk probabilities, a flexible attention mechanism that updates node and node-pair representations, and injection of degree information in each layer. We prove that GRIT is expressive — it can express shortest path distances and various graph propagation matrices. GRIT achieves state-of-the-art empirical performance across a variety of graph datasets, thus showing the power that Graph Transformers without message-passing can deliver.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ma23c	Liheng Ma, Chen Lin, Derek Lim, Adriana Romero-Soriano, Puneet K.

LIV: Language-Image Representations and Rewards for Robotic Control	We present Language-Image Value learning (LIV), a unified objective for vision-language representation and reward learning from action-free videos with text annotations. Exploiting a novel connection between dual reinforcement learning and mutual information contrastive learning, the LIV objective trains a multi-modal representation that implicitly encodes a universal value function for tasks specified as language or image goals. We use LIV to pre-train the first control-centric vision-language representation from large human video datasets such as EpicKitchen. Given only a language or image goal, the pre-trained LIV model can assign dense rewards to each frame in videos of unseen robots or humans attempting that task in unseen environments. Further, when some target domain-specific data is available, the same objective can be used to fine-tune and improve LIV and even other pre-trained representations for robotic control and reward specification in that domain. In our experiments on several simulated and real-world robot environments, LIV models consistently outperform the best prior input state representations for imitation learning, as well as reward specification methods for policy synthesis. Our results validate the advantages of joint vision-language representation and reward learning within the unified, compact LIV framework.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ma23b	Yecheng Jason Ma, Vikash Kumar, Amy Zhang, Osbert Bastani, Dinesh Jayaraman
Learning Neural Constitutive Laws from Motion Observations for Generalizable PDE Dynamics	"We propose a hybrid neural network (NN) and PDE approach for learning generalizable PDE dynamics from motion observations. Many NN approaches learn an end-to-end model that implicitly models both the governing PDE and constitutive models (or material models). Without explicit PDE knowledge, these approaches cannot guarantee physical correctness and have limited generalizability. We argue that the governing PDEs are often well-known and should be explicitly enforced rather than learned. Instead, constitutive models are particularly suitable for learning due to their data-fitting nature. To this end, we introduce a new framework termed ""Neural Constitutive Laws"" (NCLaw), which utilizes a network architecture that strictly guarantees standard constitutive priors, including rotation equivariance and undeformed state equilibrium. We embed this network inside a differentiable simulation and train the model by minimizing a loss function based on the difference between the simulation and the motion observation. We validate NCLaw on various large-deformation dynamical systems, ranging from solids to fluids. After training on a single motion trajectory, our method generalizes to new geometries, initial/boundary conditions, temporal ranges, and even multi-physics systems. On these extremely out-of-distribution generalization tasks, NCLaw is orders-of-magnitude more accurate than previous NN approaches. Real-world experiments demonstrate our method's ability to learn constitutive laws from videos."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ma23a	Pingchuan Ma, Peter Yichen Chen, Bolei Deng, Joshua B.

Which Tricks are Important for Learning to Rank?	Nowadays, state-of-the-art learning-to-rank methods are based on gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT). The most well-known algorithm is LambdaMART which was proposed more than a decade ago. Recently, several other GBDT-based ranking algorithms were proposed. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze these methods in a unified setup. In particular, we address the following questions. Is direct optimization of a smoothed ranking loss preferable over optimizing a convex surrogate? How to properly construct and smooth surrogate ranking losses? To address these questions, we compare LambdaMART with YetiRank and StochasticRank methods and their modifications. We also propose a simple improvement of the YetiRank approach that allows for optimizing specific ranking loss functions. As a result, we gain insights into learning-to-rank techniques and obtain a new state-of-the-art algorithm.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lyzhin23a	Ivan Lyzhin, Aleksei Ustimenko, Andrey Gulin, Liudmila Prokhorenkova
Pairwise Ranking Losses of Click-Through Rates Prediction for Welfare Maximization in Ad Auctions	We study the design of loss functions for click-through rates (CTR) to optimize (social) welfare in advertising auctions. Existing works either only focus on CTR predictions without consideration of business objectives (e.g., welfare) in auctions or assume that the distribution over the participants' expected cost-per-impression (eCPM) is known a priori, then use various additional assumptions on the parametric form of the distribution to derive loss functions for predicting CTRs. In this work, we bring back the welfare objectives of ad auctions into CTR predictions and propose a novel weighted rankloss to train the CTR model. Compared to existing literature, our approach provides a provable guarantee on welfare but without assumptions on the eCPMs' distribution while also avoiding the intractability of naively applying existing learning-to-rank methods. Further, we propose a theoretically justifiable technique for calibrating the losses using labels generated from a teacher network, only assuming that the teacher network has bounded $\ell_2$ generalization error. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed loss on synthetic and real-world data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lyu23b	Boxiang Lyu, Zhe Feng, Zachary Robertson, Sanmi Koyejo
Bandits with Knapsacks: Advice on Time-Varying Demands	We consider a non-stationary Bandits with Knapsack problem. The outcome distribution at each time is scaled by a non-stationary quantity that signifies changing demand volumes. Instead of studying settings with limited non-stationarity, we investigate how online predictions on the total demand volume $Q$ allows us to improve our performance guarantees. We show that, without any prediction, any online algorithm incurs a linear-in-$T$ regret. In contrast, with online predictions on $Q$, we propose an online algorithm that judiciously incorporates the predictions, and achieve regret bounds that depends on the accuracy of the predictions. These bounds are shown to be tight in settings when prediction accuracy improves across time. Our theoretical results are corroborated by our numerical findings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lyu23a	Lixing Lyu, Wang Chi Cheung
Understanding Plasticity in Neural Networks	Plasticity, the ability of a neural network to quickly change its predictions in response to new information, is essential for the adaptability and robustness of deep reinforcement learning systems. Deep neural networks are known to lose plasticity over the course of training even in relatively simple learning problems, but the mechanisms driving this phenomenon are still poorly understood. This paper conducts a systematic empirical analysis into plasticity loss, with the goal of understanding the phenomenon mechanistically in order to guide the future development of targeted solutions. We find that loss of plasticity is deeply connected to changes in the curvature of the loss landscape, but that it often occurs in the absence of saturated units. Based on this insight, we identify a number of parameterization and optimization design choices which enable networks to better preserve plasticity over the course of training. We validate the utility of these findings on larger-scale RL benchmarks in the Arcade Learning Environment.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lyle23b	Clare Lyle, Zeyu Zheng, Evgenii Nikishin, Bernardo Avila Pires, Razvan Pascanu, Will Dabney
DiscoBAX Discovery of optimal intervention sets in genomic experiment design	The discovery of therapeutics to treat genetically-driven pathologies relies on identifying genes involved in the underlying disease mechanism. Existing approaches search over the billions of potential interventions to maximize the expected influence on the target phenotype. However, to reduce the risk of failure in future stages of trials, practical experiment design aims to find a set of interventions that maximally change a target phenotype via diverse mechanisms. We propose DiscoBAX - a sample-efficient method for maximizing the rate of significant discoveries per experiment while simultaneously probing for a wide range of diverse mechanisms during a genomic experiment campaign. We provide theoretical guarantees of optimality under standard assumptions, and conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation covering both synthetic as well as real-world experimental design tasks. DiscoBAX outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for experimental design, selecting effective and diverse perturbations in biological systems.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lyle23a	Clare Lyle, Arash Mehrjou, Pascal Notin, Andrew Jesson, Stefan Bauer, Yarin Gal, Patrick Schwab
OCD: Learning to Overfit with Conditional Diffusion Models	We present a dynamic model in which the weights are conditioned on an input sample x and are learned to match those that would be obtained by finetuning a base model on x and its label y. This mapping between an input sample and network weights is approximated by a denoising diffusion model. The diffusion model we employ focuses on modifying a single layer of the base model and is conditioned on the input, activations, and output of this layer. Since the diffusion model is stochastic in nature, multiple initializations generate different networks, forming an ensemble, which leads to further improvements. Our experiments demonstrate the wide applicability of the method for image classification, 3D reconstruction, tabular data, speech separation, and natural language processing.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lutati23a	Shahar Lutati, Lior Wolf
Stabilizing GANs’ Training with Brownian Motion Controller	The training process of generative adversarial networks (GANs) is unstable and does not converge globally. In this paper, we examine the stability of GANs from the perspective of control theory and propose a universal higher-order noise-based controller called Brownian Motion Controller (BMC). Starting with the prototypical case of Dirac-GANs, we design a BMC to retrieve precisely the same but reachable optimal equilibrium. We theoretically prove that the training process of DiracGANs-BMC is globally exponential stable and derive bounds on the rate of convergence. Then we extend our BMC to normal GANs and provide implementation instructions on GANs-BMC. Our experiments show that our GANs-BMC effectively stabilizes GANs' training under StyleGANv2-ada frameworks with a faster rate of convergence, a smaller range of oscillation, and better performance in terms of FID score.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/luo23g	Tianjiao Luo, Ziyu Zhu, Jianfei Chen, Jun Zhu
HOPE: High-order Graph ODE For Modeling Interacting Dynamics	Leading graph ordinary differential equation (ODE) models have offered generalized strategies to model interacting multi-agent dynamical systems in a data-driven approach. They typically consist of a temporal graph encoder to get the initial states and a neural ODE-based generative model to model the evolution of dynamical systems. However, existing methods have severe deficiencies in capacity and efficiency due to the failure to model high-order correlations in long-term temporal trends. To tackle this, in this paper, we propose a novel model named High-order graph ODE (HOPE) for learning from dynamic interaction data, which can be naturally represented as a graph. It first adopts a twin graph encoder to initialize the latent state representations of nodes and edges, which consists of two branches to capture spatio-temporal correlations in complementary manners. More importantly, our HOPE utilizes a second-order graph ODE function which models the dynamics for both nodes and edges in the latent space respectively, which enables efficient learning of long-term dependencies from complex dynamical systems. Experiment results on a variety of datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/luo23f	Xiao Luo, Jingyang Yuan, Zijie Huang, Huiyu Jiang, Yifang Qin, Wei Ju, Ming Zhang, Yizhou Sun
A Closer Look at Few-shot Classification Again	Few-shot classification consists of a training phase where a model is learned on a relatively large dataset and an adaptation phase where the learned model is adapted to previously-unseen tasks with limited labeled samples. In this paper, we empirically prove that the training algorithm and the adaptation algorithm can be completely disentangled, which allows algorithm analysis and design to be done individually for each phase. Our meta-analysis for each phase reveals several interesting insights that may help better understand key aspects of few-shot classification and connections with other fields such as visual representation learning and transfer learning. We hope the insights and research challenges revealed in this paper can inspire future work in related directions. Code and pre-trained models (in PyTorch) are available at https://github.com/Frankluox/CloserLookAgainFewShot.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/luo23e	Xu Luo, Hao Wu, Ji Zhang, Lianli Gao, Jing Xu, Jingkuan Song
Iterative Approximate Cross-Validation	Cross-validation (CV) is one of the most popular tools for assessing and selecting predictive models. However, standard CV suffers from high computational cost when the number of folds is large. Recently, under the empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework, a line of works proposed efficient methods to approximate CV based on the solution of the ERM problem trained on the full dataset. However, in large-scale problems, it can be hard to obtain the exact solution of the ERM problem, either due to limited computational resources or due to early stopping as a way of preventing overfitting. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm to efficiently approximate CV when the ERM problem is solved via an iterative first-order algorithm, without running until convergence. Our new method extends existing guarantees for CV approximation to hold along the whole trajectory of the algorithm, including at convergence, thus generalizing existing CV approximation methods. Finally, we illustrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of our method through a range of empirical studies.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/luo23d	Yuetian Luo, Zhimei Ren, Rina Barber
Dimensionality Reduction for General KDE Mode Finding	Finding the mode of a high dimensional probability distribution $\mathcal{D}$ is a fundamental algorithmic problem in statistics and data analysis. There has been particular interest in efficient methods for solving the problem when $\mathcal{D}$ is represented as a mixture model or kernel density estimate, although few algorithmic results with worst-case approximation and runtime guarantees are known. In this work, we significantly generalize a result of (LeeLiMusco:2021) on mode approximation for Gaussian mixture models. We develop randomized dimensionality reduction methods for mixtures involving a broader class of kernels, including the popular logistic, sigmoid, and generalized Gaussian kernels. As in Lee et al.'s work, our dimensionality reduction results yield quasi-polynomial algorithms for mode finding with multiplicative accuracy $(1-\epsilon)$ for any $\epsilon > 0$. Moreover, when combined with gradient descent, they yield efficient practical heuristics for the problem. In addition to our positive results, we prove a hardness result for box kernels, showing that there is no polynomial time algorithm for finding the mode of a kernel density estimate, unless $\mathit{P} = \mathit{NP}$. Obtaining similar hardness results for kernels used in practice (like Gaussian or logistic kernels) is an interesting future direction.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/luo23c	Xinyu Luo, Christopher Musco, Cas Widdershoven
Image Restoration with Mean-Reverting Stochastic Differential Equations	This paper presents a stochastic differential equation (SDE) approach for general-purpose image restoration. The key construction consists in a mean-reverting SDE that transforms a high-quality image into a degraded counterpart as a mean state with fixed Gaussian noise. Then, by simulating the corresponding reverse-time SDE, we are able to restore the origin of the low-quality image without relying on any task-specific prior knowledge. Crucially, the proposed mean-reverting SDE has a closed-form solution, allowing us to compute the ground truth time-dependent score and learn it with a neural network. Moreover, we propose a maximum likelihood objective to learn an optimal reverse trajectory that stabilizes the training and improves the restoration results. The experiments show that our proposed method achieves highly competitive performance in quantitative comparisons on image deraining, deblurring, and denoising, setting a new state-of-the-art on two deraining datasets. Finally, the general applicability of our approach is further demonstrated via qualitative results on image super-resolution, inpainting, and dehazing.

SegCLIP: Patch Aggregation with Learnable Centers for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation	Recently, the contrastive language-image pre-training, e.g., CLIP, has demonstrated promising results on various downstream tasks. The pre-trained model can capture enriched visual concepts for images by learning from a large scale of text-image data. However, transferring the learned visual knowledge to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a CLIP-based model named SegCLIP for the topic of open-vocabulary segmentation in an annotation-free manner. The SegCLIP achieves segmentation based on ViT and the main idea is to gather patches with learnable centers to semantic regions through training on text-image pairs. The gathering operation can dynamically capture the semantic groups, which can be used to generate the final segmentation results. We further propose a reconstruction loss on masked patches and a superpixel-based KL loss with pseudo-labels to enhance the visual representation. Experimental results show that our model achieves comparable or superior segmentation accuracy on the PASCAL VOC 2012 (+0.3% mIoU), PASCAL Context (+2.3% mIoU), and COCO (+2.2% mIoU) compared with baselines. We release the code at https://github.com/ArrowLuo/SegCLIP.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/luo23a	Huaishao Luo, Junwei Bao, Youzheng Wu, Xiaodong He, Tianrui Li
A Unifying Framework to the Analysis of Interaction Methods using Synergy Functions	"Deep learning has revolutionized many areas of machine learning, from computer vision to natural language processing, but these high-performance models are generally ""black box."" Explaining such models would improve transparency and trust in AI-powered decision making and is necessary for understanding other practical needs such as robustness and fairness. A popular means of enhancing model transparency is to quantify how individual inputs contribute to model outputs (called attributions) and the magnitude of interactions between groups of inputs. A growing number of these methods import concepts and results from game theory to produce attributions and interactions. This work presents a unifying framework for game-theory-inspired attribution and $k^\text{th}$-order interaction methods. We show that, given modest assumptions, a unique full account of interactions between features, called synergies, is possible in the continuous input setting. We identify how various methods are characterized by their policy of distributing synergies. We establish that gradient-based methods are characterized by their actions on monomials, a type of synergy function, and introduce unique gradient-based methods. We show that the combination of various criteria uniquely defines the attribution/interaction methods. Thus, the community needs to identify goals and contexts when developing and employing attribution and interaction methods."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lundstrom23a	Daniel Lundstrom, Meisam Razaviyayn
Mechanistic Mode Connectivity	We study neural network loss landscapes through the lens of mode connectivity, the observation that minimizers of neural networks retrieved via training on a dataset are connected via simple paths of low loss. Specifically, we ask the following question: are minimizers that rely on different mechanisms for making their predictions connected via simple paths of low loss? We provide a definition of mechanistic similarity as shared invariances to input transformations and demonstrate that lack of linear connectivity between two models implies they use dissimilar mechanisms for making their predictions. Relevant to practice, this result helps us demonstrate that naive fine-tuning on a downstream dataset can fail to alter a model's mechanisms, e.g., fine-tuning can fail to eliminate a model's reliance on spurious attributes. Our analysis also motivates a method for targeted alteration of a model's mechanisms, named connectivity-based fine-tuning (CBFT), which we analyze using several synthetic datasets for the task of reducing a model's reliance on spurious attributes.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lubana23a	Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Eric J Bigelow, Robert P.

Adversarial Cheap Talk	Adversarial attacks in reinforcement learning (RL) often assume highly-privileged access to the victim's parameters, environment, or data. Instead, this paper proposes a novel adversarial setting called a Cheap Talk MDP in which an Adversary can merely append deterministic messages to the Victim's observation, resulting in a minimal range of influence. The Adversary cannot occlude ground truth, influence underlying environment dynamics or reward signals, introduce non-stationarity, add stochasticity, see the Victim's actions, or access their parameters. Additionally, we present a simple meta-learning algorithm called Adversarial Cheap Talk (ACT) to train Adversaries in this setting. We demonstrate that an Adversary trained with ACT can still significantly influence the Victim's training and testing performance, despite the highly constrained setting. Affecting train-time performance reveals a new attack vector and provides insight into the success and failure modes of existing RL algorithms. More specifically, we show that an ACT Adversary is capable of harming performance by interfering with the learner's function approximation, or instead helping the Victim's performance by outputting useful features. Finally, we show that an ACT Adversary can manipulate messages during train-time to directly and arbitrarily control the Victim at test-time.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lu23h	Chris Lu, Timon Willi, Alistair Letcher, Jakob Nicolaus Foerster
Learning Dense Correspondences between Photos and Sketches	Humans effortlessly grasp the connection between sketches and real-world objects, even when these sketches are far from realistic. Moreover, human sketch understanding goes beyond categorization – critically, it also entails understanding how individual elements within a sketch correspond to parts of the physical world it represents. What are the computational ingredients needed to support this ability? Towards answering this question, we make two contributions: first, we introduce a new sketch-photo correspondence benchmark, PSC6k, containing 150K annotations of 6250 sketch-photo pairs across 125 object categories, augmenting the existing Sketchy dataset with fine-grained correspondence metadata. Second, we propose a self-supervised method for learning dense correspondences between sketch-photo pairs, building upon recent advances in correspondence learning for pairs of photos. Our model uses a spatial transformer network to estimate the warp flow between latent representations of a sketch and photo extracted by a contrastive learning-based ConvNet backbone. We found that this approach outperformed several strong baselines and produced predictions that were quantitatively consistent with other warp-based methods. However, our benchmark also revealed systematic differences between predictions of the suite of models we tested and those of humans. Taken together, our work suggests a promising path towards developing artificial systems that achieve more human-like understanding of visual images at different levels of abstraction.

QAS-Bench: Rethinking Quantum Architecture Search and A Benchmark	Automatic quantum architecture search (QAS) has been widely studied across disciplines with different implications. In this paper, beyond a particular domain, we formulate the QAS problem into two basic (and relatively even ideal) tasks: i) arbitrary quantum circuit (QC) regeneration given a target QC; ii) approximating an arbitrary unitary (oracle). The latter can be connected to the setting of various quantum machine learning tasks and other QAS applications. Based on these two tasks, we generate a public QAS benchmark including 900 random QCs and 400 random unitary matrices which is still missing in the literature. We evaluate six baseline algorithms including brute force search, simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, reinforcement learning, hybrid algorithm, and differentiable algorithm as part of our benchmark. One characteristic of our proposed evaluation protocol on the basic tasks is that it deprives the domain-specific designs and techniques as used in existing QAS literature, making a unified evaluation possible and focusing on the vanilla search methods themselves without coupling with domain prior. In fact, the unitary approximation task could be algorithmically more difficult than the specific problems as it needs to explore the whole matrix space to fit the unitary. While specific tasks often only need to fit a partial observation of the unitary as the objective for search. Data and code are available at https://github.com/Lucky-Lance/QAS-Bench.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lu23f	Xudong Lu, Kaisen Pan, Ge Yan, Jiaming Shan, Wenjie Wu, Junchi Yan
Exploring the Limits of Model-Targeted Indiscriminate Data Poisoning Attacks	Indiscriminate data poisoning attacks aim to decrease a model's test accuracy by injecting a small amount of corrupted training data. Despite significant interest, existing attacks remain relatively ineffective against modern machine learning (ML) architectures. In this work, we introduce the notion of model poisoning reachability as a technical tool to explore the intrinsic limits of data poisoning attacks towards target parameters (i.e., model-targeted attacks). We derive an easily computable threshold to establish and quantify a surprising phase transition phenomenon among popular ML models: data poisoning attacks can achieve certain target parameters only when the poisoning ratio exceeds our threshold. Building on existing parameter corruption attacks and refining the Gradient Canceling attack, we perform extensive experiments to confirm our theoretical findings, test the predictability of our transition threshold, and significantly improve existing indiscriminate data poisoning baselines over a range of datasets and models. Our work highlights the critical role played by the poisoning ratio, and sheds new insights on existing empirical results, attacks and mitigation strategies in data poisoning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lu23e	Yiwei Lu, Gautam Kamath, Yaoliang Yu
Contrastive Energy Prediction for Exact Energy-Guided Diffusion Sampling in Offline Reinforcement Learning	Guided sampling is a vital approach for applying diffusion models in real-world tasks that embeds human-defined guidance during the sampling procedure. This paper considers a general setting where the guidance is defined by an (unnormalized) energy function. The main challenge for this setting is that the intermediate guidance during the diffusion sampling procedure, which is jointly defined by the sampling distribution and the energy function, is unknown and is hard to estimate. To address this challenge, we propose an exact formulation of the intermediate guidance as well as a novel training objective named contrastive energy prediction (CEP) to learn the exact guidance. Our method is guaranteed to converge to the exact guidance under unlimited model capacity and data samples, while previous methods can not. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to offline reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms. We also provide some examples of applying CEP for image synthesis to demonstrate the scalability of CEP on high-dimensional data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lu23d	Cheng Lu, Huayu Chen, Jianfei Chen, Hang Su, Chongxuan Li, Jun Zhu
STEP: Learning N:M Structured Sparsity Masks from Scratch with Precondition	Recent innovations on hardware (e.g. Nvidia A100) have motivated learning N:M structured sparsity masks from scratch for fast model inference. However, state-of-the-art learning recipes in this regime (e.g. SR-STE) are proposed for non-adaptive optimizers like momentum SGD, while incurring non-trivial accuracy drop for Adam-trained models like attention-based LLMs. In this paper, we first demonstrate such gap origins from poorly estimated second moment (i.e. variance) in Adam states given by the masked weights. We conjecture that learning N:M masks with Adam should take the critical regime of variance estimation into account. In light of this, we propose STEP, an Adam-aware recipe that learns N:M masks with two phases: first, STEP calculates a reliable variance estimate (	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lu23c	Yucheng Lu, Shivani Agrawal, Suvinay Subramanian, Oleg Rybakov, Christopher De Sa, Amir Yazdanbakhsh
Two-Scale Gradient Descent Ascent Dynamics Finds Mixed Nash Equilibria of Continuous Games: A Mean-Field Perspective	Finding the mixed Nash equilibria (MNE) of a two-player zero sum continuous game is an important and challenging problem in machine learning. A canonical algorithm to finding the MNE is the noisy gradient descent ascent method which in the infinite particle limit gives rise to the Mean-Field Gradient Descent Ascent (GDA) dynamics on the space of probability measures. In this paper, we first study the convergence of a two-scale Mean-Field GDA dynamics for finding the MNE of the entropy-regularized objective. More precisely we show that for each finite temperature (or regularization parameter), the two-scale Mean-Field GDA with a suitable finite scale ratio converges exponentially to the unique MNE without assuming the convexity or concavity of the interaction potential. The key ingredient of our proof lies in the construction of new Lyapunov functions that dissipate exponentially along the Mean-Field GDA. We further study the simulated annealing of the Mean-Field GDA dynamics. We show that with a temperature schedule that decays logarithmically in time the annealed Mean-Field GDA converges to the MNE of the original unregularized objective.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lu23b	Yulong Lu
Bilevel Optimization with Coupled Decision-Dependent Distributions	Bilevel optimization has gained significant popularity in recent years due to its ability to formulate various machine learning problems. For instance, in meta-learning, the upper-level (UL) problem offers a good initialization for the lower-level (LL) model to facilitate adaptation. However, the decision variables can impact data features and outcomes, leading to the phenomenon known as performativity. In this work, we investigate the inclusion of decision-dependent distributions in bilevel optimization. Specifically, we consider the scenarios where the UL data distribution depends on the LL optimization variable, and the LL data distribution also depends on the UL decision variable. We first establish sufficient conditions for the existence of performatively stable (PS) solutions in this class of bilevel problems. Also, we propose efficient stochastic algorithms to find the PS point with theoretical convergence rate analysis and discuss the theoretical optimality of the obtained solution. Our theoretical analysis is corroborated through a series of numerical experiments, wherein we evaluate the performance of the bilevel performative prediction algorithms alongside non-performative counterparts in the context of meta strategic learning problems.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lu23a	Songtao Lu

Reflected Diffusion Models	Score-based diffusion models learn to reverse a stochastic differential equation that maps data to noise. However, for complex tasks, numerical error can compound and result in highly unnatural samples. Previous work mitigates this drift with thresholding, which projects to the natural data domain (such as pixel space for images) after each diffusion step, but this leads to a mismatch between the training and generative processes. To incorporate data constraints in a principled manner, we present Reflected Diffusion Models, which instead reverse a reflected stochastic differential equation evolving on the support of the data. Our approach learns the perturbed score function through a generalized score matching loss and extends key components of standard diffusion models including diffusion guidance, likelihood-based training, and ODE sampling. We also bridge the theoretical gap with thresholding: such schemes are just discretizations of reflected SDEs. On standard image benchmarks, our method is competitive with or surpasses the state of the art without architectural modifications and, for classifier-free guidance, our approach enables fast exact sampling with ODEs and produces more faithful samples under high guidance weight.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lou23a	Aaron Lou, Stefano Ermon
Dataset Distillation with Convexified Implicit Gradients	We propose a new dataset distillation algorithm using reparameterization and convexification of implicit gradients (RCIG), that substantially improves the state-of-the-art. To this end, we first formulate dataset distillation as a bi-level optimization problem. Then, we show how implicit gradients can be effectively used to compute meta-gradient updates. We further equip the algorithm with a convexified approximation that corresponds to learning on top of a frozen finite-width neural tangent kernel. Finally, we improve bias in implicit gradients by parameterizing the neural network to enable analytical computation of final-layer parameters given the body parameters. RCIG establishes the new state-of-the-art on a diverse series of dataset distillation tasks. Notably, with one image per class, on resized ImageNet, RCIG sees on average a 108% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art distillation algorithm. Similarly, we observed a 66% gain over SOTA on Tiny-ImageNet and 37% on CIFAR-100.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/loo23a	Noel Loo, Ramin Hasani, Mathias Lechner, Daniela Rus
The Flan Collection: Designing Data and Methods for Effective Instruction Tuning	We study the design decision of publicly available instruction tuning methods, by reproducing and breaking down the development of Flan 2022 (Chung et al., 2022). Through careful ablation studies on the Flan Collection of tasks and methods, we tease apart the effect of design decisions which enable Flan-T5 to outperform prior work by 3-17% across evaluation settings. We find task balancing and enrichment techniques are overlooked but critical to effective instruction tuning, and in particular, training with mixed prompt settings (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) actually yields equivalent or stronger (2%) performance in all settings. In further experiments we show Flan-T5 requires less finetuning to converge higher and faster than T5 on single downstream tasks – motivating instruction-tuned models as more computationally-efficient starting checkpoints for new tasks. Finally, to accelerate research on instruction tuning, we make the Flan 2022 collection of datasets, templates, and methods publicly available.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/longpre23a	Shayne Longpre, Le Hou, Tu Vu, Albert Webson, Hyung Won Chung, Yi Tay, Denny Zhou, Quoc V Le, Barret Zoph, Jason Wei, Adam Roberts
Multi-Symmetry Ensembles: Improving Diversity and Generalization via Opposing Symmetries	Deep ensembles (DE) have been successful in improving model performance by learning diverse members via the stochasticity of random initialization. While recent works have attempted to promote further diversity in DE via hyperparameters or regularizing loss functions, these methods primarily still rely on a stochastic approach to explore the hypothesis space. In this work, we present Multi-Symmetry Ensembles (MSE), a framework for constructing diverse ensembles by capturing the multiplicity of hypotheses along symmetry axes, which explore the hypothesis space beyond stochastic perturbations of model weights and hyperparameters. We leverage recent advances in contrastive representation learning to create models that separately capture opposing hypotheses of invariant and equivariant functional classes and present a simple ensembling approach to efficiently combine appropriate hypotheses for a given task. We show that MSE effectively captures the multiplicity of conflicting hypotheses that is often required in large, diverse datasets like ImageNet. As a result of their inherent diversity, MSE improves classification performance, uncertainty quantification, and generalization across a series of transfer tasks.

Flipping Coins to Estimate Pseudocounts for Exploration in Reinforcement Learning	We propose a new method for count-based exploration in high-dimensional state spaces. Unlike previous work which relies on density models, we show that counts can be derived by averaging samples from the Rademacher distribution (or coin flips). This insight is used to set up a simple supervised learning objective which, when optimized, yields a state's visitation count. We show that our method is significantly more effective at deducing ground-truth visitation counts than previous work; when used as an exploration bonus for a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, it outperforms existing approaches on most of 9 challenging exploration tasks, including the Atari game Montezuma's Revenge.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lobel23a	Sam Lobel, Akhil Bagaria, George Konidaris
Contextual Combinatorial Bandits with Probabilistically Triggered Arms	We study contextual combinatorial bandits with probabilistically triggered arms (C$^2$MAB-T) under a variety of smoothness conditions that capture a wide range of applications, such as contextual cascading bandits and contextual influence maximization bandits. Under the triggering probability modulated (TPM) condition, we devise the C$^2$-UCB-T algorithm and propose a novel analysis that achieves an $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{KT})$ regret bound, removing a potentially exponentially large factor $O(1/p_{\min})$, where $d$ is the dimension of contexts, $p_{\min}$ is the minimum positive probability that any arm can be triggered, and batch-size $K$ is the maximum number of arms that can be triggered per round. Under the variance modulated (VM) or triggering probability and variance modulated (TPVM) conditions, we propose a new variance-adaptive algorithm VAC$^2$-UCB and derive a regret bound $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$, which is independent of the batch-size $K$. As a valuable by-product, our analysis technique and variance-adaptive algorithm can be applied to the CMAB-T and C$^2$MAB setting, improving existing results there as well. We also include experiments that demonstrate the improved performance of our algorithms compared with benchmark algorithms on synthetic and real-world datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23bf	Xutong Liu, Jinhang Zuo, Siwei Wang, John C.S.

N$\textA^\text2$Q: Neural Attention Additive Model for Interpretable Multi-Agent Q-Learning	Value decomposition is widely used in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, however, its implicit credit assignment mechanism is not yet fully understood due to black-box networks. In this work, we study an interpretable value decomposition framework via the family of generalized additive models. We present a novel method, named Neural Attention Additive Q-learning (N$\text{A}^\text{2}$Q), providing inherent intelligibility of collaboration behavior. N$\text{A}^\text{2}$Q can explicitly factorize the optimal joint policy induced by enriching shape functions to model all possible coalition of agents into individual policies. Moreover, we construct the identity semantics to promote estimating credits together with the global state and individual value functions, where local semantic masks help us diagnose whether each agent captures the relevant-task information. Extensive experiments show that N$\text{A}^\text{2}$Q consistently achieves superior performance compared to different state-of-the-art methods on all challenging tasks, while yielding human-like interpretability.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23be	Zichuan Liu, Yuanyang Zhu, Chunlin Chen
Unsupervised Out-of-Distribution Detection with Diffusion Inpainting	Unsupervised out-of-distribution detection (OOD) seeks to identify out-of-domain data by learning only from unlabeled in-domain data. We present a novel approach for this task – Lift, Map, Detect (LMD) – that leverages recent advancement in diffusion models. Diffusion models are one type of generative models. At their core, they learn an iterative denoising process that gradually maps a noisy image closer to their training manifolds. LMD leverages this intuition for OOD detection. Specifically, LMD lifts an image off its original manifold by corrupting it, and maps it towards the in-domain manifold with a diffusion model. For an OOD image, the mapped image would have a large distance away from its original manifold, and LMD would identify it as OOD accordingly. We show through extensive experiments that LMD achieves competitive performance across a broad variety of datasets.

Which Invariance Should We Transfer? A Causal Minimax Learning Approach	A major barrier to deploying current machine learning models lies in their non-reliability to dataset shifts. To resolve this problem, most existing studies attempted to transfer stable information to unseen environments. Particularly, independent causal mechanisms-based methods proposed to remove mutable causal mechanisms via the do-operator. Compared to previous methods, the obtained stable predictors are more effective in identifying stable information. However, a key question remains: which subset of this whole stable information should the model transfer, in order to achieve optimal generalization ability? To answer this question, we present a comprehensive minimax analysis from a causal perspective. Specifically, we first provide a graphical condition for the whole stable set to be optimal. When this condition fails, we surprisingly find with an example that this whole stable set, although can fully exploit stable information, is not the optimal one to transfer. To identify the optimal subset under this case, we propose to estimate the worst-case risk with a novel optimization scheme over the intervention functions on mutable causal mechanisms. We then propose an efficient algorithm to search for the subset with minimal worst-case risk, based on a newly defined equivalence relation between stable subsets. Compared to the exponential cost of exhaustively searching over all subsets, our searching strategy enjoys a polynomial complexity. The effectiveness and efficiency of our methods are demonstrated on synthetic data and the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23bc	Mingzhou Liu, Xiangyu Zheng, Xinwei Sun, Fang Fang, Yizhou Wang
Image Shortcut Squeezing: Countering Perturbative Availability Poisons with Compression	Perturbative availability poisoning (PAP) adds small changes to images to prevent their use for model training. Current research adopts the belief that practical and effective approaches to countering such poisons do not exist. In this paper, we argue that it is time to abandon this belief. We present extensive experiments showing that 12 state-of-the-art PAP methods are vulnerable to Image Shortcut Squeezing (ISS), which is based on simple compression. For example, on average, ISS restores the CIFAR-10 model accuracy to 81.73%, surpassing the previous best preprocessing-based countermeasures by 37.97% absolute. ISS also (slightly) outperforms adversarial training and has higher generalizability to unseen perturbation norms and also higher efficiency. Our investigation reveals that the property of PAP perturbations depends on the type of surrogate model used for poison generation, and it explains why a specific ISS compression yields the best performance for a specific type of PAP perturbation. We further test stronger, adaptive poisoning, and show it falls short of being an ideal defense against ISS. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of considering various (simple) countermeasures to ensure the meaningfulness of analysis carried out during the development of availability poisons.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23bb	Zhuoran Liu, Zhengyu Zhao, Martha Larson
D2Match: Leveraging Deep Learning and Degeneracy for Subgraph Matching	Subgraph matching is a fundamental building block for graph-based applications and is challenging due to its high-order combinatorial nature. Existing studies usually tackle it by combinatorial optimization or learning-based methods. However, they suffer from exponential computational costs or searching the matching without theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we develop $D^2$Match by leveraging the efficiency of Deep learning and Degeneracy for subgraph matching. More specifically, we first prove that subgraph matching can degenerate to subtree matching, and subsequently is equivalent to finding a perfect matching on a bipartite graph. We can then yield an implementation of linear time complexity by the built-in tree-structured aggregation mechanism on graph neural networks. Moreover, circle structures and node attributes can be easily incorporated in $D^2$Match to boost the matching performance. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to show the superior performance of our $D^2$Match and confirm that our $D^2$Match indeed exploits the subtrees and differs from existing GNNs-based subgraph matching methods that depend on memorizing the data distribution divergence.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23ba	Xuanzhou Liu, Lin Zhang, Jiaqi Sun, Yujiu Yang, Haiqin Yang

VectorMapNet: End-to-end Vectorized HD Map Learning	Autonomous driving systems require High-Definition (HD) semantic maps to navigate around urban roads. Existing solutions approach the semantic mapping problem by offline manual annotation, which suffers from serious scalability issues. Recent learning-based methods produce dense rasterized segmentation predictions to construct maps. However, these predictions do not include instance information of individual map elements and require heuristic post-processing to obtain vectorized maps. To tackle these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end vectorized HD map learning pipeline, termed VectorMapNet. VectorMapNet takes onboard sensor observations and predicts a sparse set of polylines in the bird's-eye view. This pipeline can explicitly model the spatial relation between map elements and generate vectorized maps that are friendly to downstream autonomous driving tasks. Extensive experiments show that VectorMapNet achieve strong map learning performance on both nuScenes and Argoverse2 dataset, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by 14.2 mAP and 14.6mAP. Qualitatively, VectorMapNet is capable of generating comprehensive maps and capturing fine-grained details of road geometry. To the best of our knowledge, VectorMapNet is the first work designed towards end-to-end vectorized map learning from onboard observations.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23ax	Yicheng Liu, Tianyuan Yuan, Yue Wang, Yilun Wang, Hang Zhao
Gradient-based Wang-Landau Algorithm: A Novel Sampler for Output Distribution of Neural Networks over the Input Space	The output distribution of a neural network (NN) over the entire input space captures the complete input-output mapping relationship, offering in- sights toward a more comprehensive NN under- standing. Exhaustive enumeration or traditional Monte Carlo methods for the entire input space can exhibit impractical sampling time, especially for high-dimensional inputs. To make such difficult sampling computationally feasible, in this paper, we propose a novel Gradient-based Wang-Landau (GWL) sampler. We first draw the connection between the output distribution of a NN and the density of states (DOS) of a physical system. Then, we renovate the classic sampler for the DOS problem, Wang-Landau algorithm, by re-placing its random proposals with gradient-based Monte Carlo proposals. This way, our GWL sampler investigates the under-explored subsets of the input space much more efficiently. Extensive experiments have verified the accuracy of the output distribution generated by GWL and also showcased several interesting findings - for example, in a binary image classification task, both CNN and ResNet mapped the majority of human unrecognizable images to very negative logit values.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23aw	Weitang Liu, Yi-Zhuang You, Ying Wai Li, Jingbo Shang
Active Policy Improvement from Multiple Black-box Oracles	Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant strides in various complex domains. However, identifying an effective policy via RL often necessitates extensive exploration. Imitation learning aims to mitigate this issue by using expert demonstrations to guide exploration. In real-world scenarios, one often has access to multiple suboptimal black-box experts, rather than a single optimal oracle. These experts do not universally outperform each other across all states, presenting a challenge in actively deciding which oracle to use and in which state. We introduce MAPS and MAPS-SE, a class of policy improvement algorithms that perform imitation learning from multiple suboptimal oracles. In particular, MAPS actively selects which of the oracles to imitate and improve their value function estimates, and MAPS-SE additionally leverages an active state exploration criterion to determine which states one should explore. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis and demonstrate that MAPS and MAPS-SE enjoy sample efficiency advantage over the state-of-the-art policy improvement algorithms. Empirical results show that MAPS-SE significantly accelerates policy optimization via state-wise imitation learning from multiple oracles across a broad spectrum of control tasks in the DeepMind Control Suite.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23av	Xuefeng Liu, Takuma Yoneda, Chaoqi Wang, Matthew Walter, Yuxin Chen
Optimization for Amortized Inverse Problems	Incorporating a deep generative model as the prior distribution in inverse problems has established substantial success in reconstructing images from corrupted observations. Notwithstanding, the existing optimization approaches use gradient descent largely without adapting to the non-convex nature of the problem and can be sensitive to initial values, impeding further performance improvement. In this paper, we propose an efficient amortized optimization scheme for inverse problems with a deep generative prior. Specifically, the optimization task with high degrees of difficulty is decomposed into optimizing a sequence of much easier ones. We provide a theoretical guarantee of the proposed algorithm and empirically validate it on different inverse problems. As a result, our approach outperforms baseline methods qualitatively and quantitatively by a large margin.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23au	Tianci Liu, Tong Yang, Quan Zhang, Qi Lei
Online Nonstochastic Control with Adversarial and Static Constraints	This paper studies online nonstochastic control problems with adversarial and static constraints. We propose online nonstochastic control algorithms that achieve both sublinear regret and sublinear adversarial constraint violation while keeping static constraint violation minimal against the optimal constrained linear control policy in hindsight. To establish the results, we introduce an online convex optimization with memory framework under adversarial and static constraints, which serves as a subroutine for the constrained online nonstochastic control algorithms. This subroutine also achieves the state-of-the-art regret and constraint violation bounds for constrained online convex optimization problems, which is of independent interest. Our experiments demonstrate the proposed control algorithms are adaptive to adversarial constraints and achieve smaller cumulative costs and violations. Moreover, our algorithms are less conservative and achieve significantly smaller cumulative costs than the state-of-the-art algorithm.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23at	Xin Liu, Zixian Yang, Lei Ying
Retrosynthetic Planning with Dual Value Networks	Retrosynthesis, which aims to find a route to synthesize a target molecule from commercially available starting materials, is a critical task in drug discovery and materials design. Recently, the combination of ML-based single-step reaction predictors with multi-step planners has led to promising results. However, the single-step predictors are mostly trained offline to optimize the single-step accuracy, without considering complete routes. Here, we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the single-step predictor, by using a tree-shaped MDP to optimize complete routes. Specifically, we propose a novel online training algorithm, called Planning with Dual Value Networks (PDVN), which alternates between the planning phase and updating phase. In PDVN, we construct two separate value networks to predict the synthesizability and cost of molecules, respectively. To maintain the single-step accuracy, we design a two-branch network structure for the single-step predictor. On the widely-used USPTO dataset, our PDVN algorithm improves the search success rate of existing multi-step planners (e.g., increasing the success rate from 85.79% to 98.95% for Retro$^{\ast}$, and reducing the number of model calls by half while solving 99.47% molecules for RetroGraph). Additionally, PDVN helps find shorter synthesis routes (e.g., reducing the average route length from 5.76 to 4.83 for Retro$^{\ast}$, and from 5.63 to 4.78 for RetroGraph).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23as	Guoqing Liu, Di Xue, Shufang Xie, Yingce Xia, Austin Tripp, Krzysztof Maziarz, Marwin Segler, Tao Qin, Zongzhang Zhang, Tie-Yan Liu
Revisiting Pseudo-Label for Single-Positive Multi-Label Learning	To deal with the challenge of high cost of annotating all relevant labels for each example in multi-label learning, single-positive multi-label learning (SPMLL) has been studied in recent years, where each example is annotated with only one positive label. By adopting pseudo-label generation, i.e., assigning pseudo-label to each example by various strategies, existing methods have empirically validated that SPMLL would significantly reduce the amount of supervision with a tolerable damage in classification performance. However, there is no existing method that can provide a theoretical guarantee for learning from pseudo-label on SPMLL. In this paper, the conditions of the effectiveness of learning from pseudo-label for SPMLL are shown and the learnability of pseudo-label-based methods is proven. Furthermore, based on the theoretical guarantee of pseudo-label for SPMLL, we propose a novel SPMLL method named MIME, i.e., Mutual label enhancement for sIngle-positive Multi-label lEarning and prove that the generated pseudo-label by MIME approximately converges to the fully-supervised case. Experiments on four image datasets and five MLL datasets show the effectiveness of our methods over several existing SPMLL approaches.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23ar	Biao Liu, Ning Xu, Jiaqi Lv, Xin Geng
Dropout Reduces Underfitting	Introduced by Hinton et al. in 2012, dropout has stood the test of time as a regularizer for preventing overfitting in neural networks. In this study, we demonstrate that dropout can also mitigate underfitting when used at the start of training. During the early phase, we find dropout reduces the directional variance of gradients across mini-batches and helps align the mini-batch gradients with the entire dataset's gradient. This helps counteract the stochasticity of SGD and limit the influence of individual batches on model training. Our findings lead us to a solution for improving performance in underfitting models - early dropout: dropout is applied only during the initial phases of training, and turned off afterwards. Models equipped with early dropout achieve lower final training loss compared to their counterparts without dropout. Additionally, we explore a symmetric technique for regularizing overfitting models - late dropout, where dropout is not used in the early iterations and is only activated later in training. Experiments on ImageNet and various vision tasks demonstrate that our methods consistently improve generalization accuracy. Our results encourage more research on understanding regularization in deep learning and our methods can be useful tools for future neural network training, especially in the era of large data.

Taxonomy-Structured Domain Adaptation	Domain adaptation aims to mitigate distribution shifts among different domains. However, traditional formulations are mostly limited to categorical domains, greatly simplifying nuanced domain relationships in the real world. In this work, we tackle a generalization with taxonomy-structured domains, which formalizes domains with nested, hierarchical similarity structures such as animal species and product catalogs.

Same Pre-training Loss, Better Downstream: Implicit Bias Matters for Language Models	Language modeling on large-scale datasets improves performance of various downstream tasks. The validation pre-training loss is often used as the evaluation metric for language models since the pre-training loss tends to be well-correlated with downstream performance (which is itself hard to evaluate comprehensively). Contrary to the conventional wisdom, this paper shows that 1) pre-training loss cannot fully explain downstream performance and 2) flatness of the model is well-correlated with downstream performance where pre-training loss is not. We identify three ways to produce models with the same pre-training loss but different downstream performance: continue pre-training after convergence, increasing the model size, and changing the pre-training algorithms. These experiments demonstrate the existence of implicit bias of pre-training algorithms—among models with the same minimal pre-training loss, they implicitly prefer more transferable ones. Toward understanding this implicit bias, we prove that SGD with standard mini-batch noise implicitly prefers flatter minima of pre-training loss in language models, and empirically observe a strong correlation between flatness (measured by the trace of Hessian) and downstream performance among models with the same pre-training loss. We also prove in a synthetic language setting that among models with the minimal pre-training loss, the flattest model transfers to downstream tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23ao	Hong Liu, Sang Michael Xie, Zhiyuan Li, Tengyu Ma
Trapdoor Normalization with Irreversible Ownership Verification	This paper introduces a deep model watermark with an irreversible ownership verification scheme: Trapdoor Normalization (TdN), inspired by the trapdoor function in traditional cryptography. To protect intellectual property within deep models, the proposed method is able to embed ownership information into normalization layers during training. We argue and empirically validate that relevant methods are vulnerable to ambiguity attacks, where the forged watermarks can cast ambiguity over the ownership verification. The primary trait that distinguishes this work from previous ones, is its design of a bidirectional connection between watermarks and deep models. Thereby, TdN enables an irreversible ownership verification scheme that is difficult for the adversary to compromise. In this way, the proposed TdN can effectively defeat ambiguity attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is not only superior to previous state-of-the-art methods in robustness, but also has better efficiency.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23an	Hanwen Liu, Zhenyu Weng, Yuesheng Zhu, Yadong Mu
Deja Vu: Contextual Sparsity for Efficient LLMs at Inference Time	Large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of parameters have sparked a new wave of exciting AI applications. However, they are computationally expensive at inference time. Sparsity is a natural approach to reduce this cost, but existing methods either require costly retraining, have to forgo LLM's in-context learning ability, or do not yield wall-clock time speedup on modern hardware. We hypothesize that contextual sparsity, which are small, input-dependent sets of attention heads and MLP parameters that yield approximately the same output as the dense model for a given input, can address these issues. We show that contextual sparsity exists, that it can be accurately predicted, and that we can exploit it to speed up LLM inference in wall-clock time without compromising LLM's quality or in-context learning ability. Based on these insights, we propose DejaVu, a system that uses a low-cost algorithm to predict contextual sparsity on the fly given inputs to each layer, along with an asynchronous and hardware-aware implementation that speeds up LLM inference. We validate that DejaVu can reduce the inference latency of OPT-175B by over 2$\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art FasterTransformer, and over 6$\times$ compared to the widely used Hugging Face implementation, without compromising model quality. The code is available at https://github.com/FMInference/DejaVu.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23am	Zichang Liu, Jue Wang, Tri Dao, Tianyi Zhou, Binhang Yuan, Zhao Song, Anshumali Shrivastava, Ce Zhang, Yuandong Tian, Christopher Re, Beidi Chen
Global Optimization with Parametric Function Approximation	We consider the problem of global optimization with noisy zeroth order oracles — a well-motivated problem useful for various applications ranging from hyper-parameter tuning for deep learning to new material design. Existing work relies on Gaussian processes or other non-parametric family, which suffers from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm GO-UCB that leverages a parametric family of functions (e.g., neural networks) instead. Under a realizable assumption and a few other mild geometric conditions, we show that GO-UCB achieves a cumulative regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ where $T$ is the time horizon. At the core of GO-UCB is a carefully designed uncertainty set over parameters based on gradients that allows optimistic exploration. Synthetic and real-world experiments illustrate GO-UCB works better than popular Bayesian optimization approaches, even if the model is misspecified.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23al	Chong Liu, Yu-Xiang Wang
TR0N: Translator Networks for 0-Shot Plug-and-Play Conditional Generation	"We propose TR0N, a highly general framework to turn pre-trained unconditional generative models, such as GANs and VAEs, into conditional models. The conditioning can be highly arbitrary, and requires only a pre-trained auxiliary model. For example, we show how to turn unconditional models into class-conditional ones with the help of a classifier, and also into text-to-image models by leveraging CLIP. TR0N learns a lightweight stochastic mapping which ""translates'"" between the space of conditions and the latent space of the generative model, in such a way that the generated latent corresponds to a data sample satisfying the desired condition. The translated latent samples are then further improved upon through Langevin dynamics, enabling us to obtain higher-quality data samples. TR0N requires no training data nor fine-tuning, yet can achieve a zero-shot FID of 10.9 on MS-COCO, outperforming competing alternatives not only on this metric, but also in sampling speed – all while retaining a much higher level of generality. Our code is available at https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/tr0n."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23ak	Zhaoyan Liu, Noël Vouitsis, Satya Krishna Gorti, Jimmy Ba, Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem
What can online reinforcement learning with function approximation benefit from general coverage conditions?	In online reinforcement learning (RL), instead of employing standard structural assumptions on Markov decision processes (MDPs), using a certain coverage condition (original from offline RL) is enough to ensure sample-efficient guarantees (Xie et al. 2023). In this work, we focus on this new direction by digging more possible and general coverage conditions, and study the potential and the utility of them in efficient online RL. We identify more concepts, including the $L^p$ variant of concentrability, the density ratio realizability, and trade-off on the partial/rest coverage condition, that can be also beneficial to sample-efficient online RL, achieving improved regret bound. Furthermore, if exploratory offline data are used, under our coverage conditions, both statistically and computationally efficient guarantees can be achieved for online RL. Besides, even though the MDP structure is given, e.g., linear MDP, we elucidate that, good coverage conditions are still beneficial to obtain faster regret bound beyond $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ and even a logarithmic order regret. These results provide a good justification for the usage of general coverage conditions in efficient online RL.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23aj	Fanghui Liu, Luca Viano, Volkan Cevher
I$^2$SB: Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge	We propose Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (I$^2$SB), a new class of conditional diffusion models that directly learn the nonlinear diffusion processes between two given distributions. These diffusion bridges are particularly useful for image restoration, as the degraded images are structurally informative priors for reconstructing the clean images. I$^2$SB belongs to a tractable class of Schrödinger bridge, the nonlinear extension to score-based models, whose marginal distributions can be computed analytically given boundary pairs. This results in a simulation-free framework for nonlinear diffusions, where the I$^2$SB training becomes scalable by adopting practical techniques used in standard diffusion models. We validate I$^2$SB in solving various image restoration tasks, including inpainting, super-resolution, deblurring, and JPEG restoration on ImageNet 256$\times$256 and show that I$^2$SB surpasses standard conditional diffusion models with more interpretable generative processes. Moreover, I$^2$SB matches the performance of inverse methods that additionally require the knowledge of the corruption operators. Our work opens up new algorithmic opportunities for developing efficient nonlinear diffusion models on a large scale.

FusionRetro: Molecule Representation Fusion via In-Context Learning for Retrosynthetic Planning	Retrosynthetic planning aims to devise a complete multi-step synthetic route from starting materials to a target molecule. Current strategies use a decoupled approach of single-step retrosynthesis models and search algorithms, taking only the product as the input to predict the reactants for each planning step and ignoring valuable context information along the synthetic route. In this work, we propose a novel framework that utilizes context information for improved retrosynthetic planning. We view synthetic routes as reaction graphs and propose to incorporate context through three principled steps: encode molecules into embeddings, aggregate information over routes, and readout to predict reactants. Our approach is the first attempt to utilize in-context learning for retrosynthesis prediction in retrosynthetic planning. The entire framework can be efficiently optimized in an end-to-end fashion and produce more practical and accurate predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that by fusing in the context information over routes, our model significantly improves the performance of retrosynthetic planning over baselines that are not context-aware, especially for long synthetic routes. Code is available at https://github.com/SongtaoLiu0823/FusionRetro.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23ah	Songtao Liu, Zhengkai Tu, Minkai Xu, Zuobai Zhang, Lu Lin, Rex Ying, Jian Tang, Peilin Zhao, Dinghao Wu
Generating Private Synthetic Data with Genetic Algorithms	We study the problem of efficiently generating differentially private synthetic data that approximate the statistical properties of an underlying sensitive dataset. In recent years, there has been a growing line of work that approaches this problem using first-order optimization techniques. However, such techniques are restricted to optimizing differentiable objectives only, severely limiting the types of analyses that can be conducted. For example, first-order mechanisms have been primarily successful in approximating statistical queries only in the form of marginals for discrete data domains. In some cases, one can circumvent such issues by relaxing the task's objective to maintain differentiability. However, even when possible, these approaches impose a fundamental limitation in which modifications to the minimization problem become additional sources of error. Therefore, we propose Private-GSD, a private genetic algorithm based on	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23ag	Terrance Liu, Jingwu Tang, Giuseppe Vietri, Steven Wu
Simple Embodied Language Learning as a Byproduct of Meta-Reinforcement Learning	Whereas machine learning models typically learn language by directly training on language tasks (e.g., next-word prediction), language emerges in human children as a byproduct of solving non-language tasks (e.g., acquiring food). Motivated by this observation, we ask: can embodied reinforcement learning (RL) agents also indirectly learn language from non-language tasks? Learning to associate language with its meaning requires a dynamic environment with varied language. Therefore, we investigate this question in a multi-task environment with language that varies across the different tasks. Specifically, we design an office navigation environment, where the agent's goal is to find a particular office, and office locations differ in different buildings (i.e., tasks). Each building includes a floor plan with a simple language description of the goal office's location, which can be visually read as an RGB image when visited. We find RL agents indeed are able to indirectly learn language. Agents trained with current meta-RL algorithms successfully generalize to reading floor plans with held-out layouts and language phrases, and quickly navigate to the correct office, despite receiving no direct language supervision.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23af	Evan Zheran Liu, Sahaana Suri, Tong Mu, Allan Zhou, Chelsea Finn

RSC: Accelerate Graph Neural Networks Training via Randomized Sparse Computations	Training graph neural networks (GNNs) is extremely time consuming because sparse graph-based operations are hard to be accelerated by community hardware. Prior art successfully reduces the computation cost of dense matrix based operations (e.g., convolution and linear) via sampling-based approximation. However, unlike dense matrices, sparse matrices are stored in the irregular data format such that each row/column may have different number of non-zero entries. Thus, compared to the dense counterpart, approximating sparse operations has two unique challenges (1) we cannot directly control the efficiency of approximated sparse operation since the computation is only executed on non-zero entries; (2) sampling sparse matrices is much more inefficient due to the irregular data format. To address the issues, our key idea is to control the accuracy-efficiency trade off by optimizing computation resource allocation layer-wisely and epoch-wisely. For the first challenge, we customize the computation resource to different sparse operations, while limit the total used resource below a certain budget. For the second challenge, we cache previous sampled sparse matrices to reduce the epoch-wise sampling overhead. Finally, we propose a switching mechanisms to improve the generalization of GNNs trained with approximated operations. To this end, we propose Randomized Sparse Computation. In practice, rsc can achieve up to 11.6X speedup for a single sparse operation and 1.6X end-to-end wall-clock time speedup with almost no accuracy drop.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23ad	Zirui Liu, Chen Shengyuan, Kaixiong Zhou, Daochen Zha, Xiao Huang, Xia Hu
Lazy Agents: A New Perspective on Solving Sparse Reward Problem in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning	Sparse reward remains a valuable and challenging problem in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). This paper addresses this issue from a new perspective, i.e., lazy agents. We empirically illustrate how lazy agents damage learning from both exploration and exploitation. Then, we propose a novel MARL framework called Lazy Agents Avoidance through Influencing External States (LAIES). Firstly, we examine the causes and types of lazy agents in MARL using a causal graph of the interaction between agents and their environment. Then, we mathematically define the concept of fully lazy agents and teams by calculating the causal effect of their actions on external states using the do-calculus process. Based on definitions, we provide two intrinsic rewards to motivate agents, i.e., individual diligence intrinsic motivation (IDI) and collaborative diligence intrinsic motivation (CDI). IDI and CDI employ counterfactual reasoning based on the external states transition model (ESTM) we developed. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various tasks, including the sparse-reward version of StarCraft multi-agent challenge (SMAC) and Google Research Football (GRF). Our code is open-source and available at https://github.com/liuboyin/LAIES.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23ac	Boyin Liu, Zhiqiang Pu, Yi Pan, Jianqiang Yi, Yanyan Liang, D. Zhang
OMS-DPM: Optimizing the Model Schedule for Diffusion Probabilistic Models	Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) are a new class of generative models that have achieved state-of-the-art generation quality in various domains. Despite the promise, one major drawback of DPMs is the slow generation speed due to the large number of neural network evaluations required in the generation process. In this paper, we reveal an overlooked dimension—model schedule—for optimizing the trade-off between generation quality and speed. More specifically, we observe that small models, though having worse generation quality when used alone, could outperform large models in certain generation steps. Therefore, unlike the traditional way of using a single model, using different models in different generation steps in a carefully designed model schedule could potentially improve generation quality and speed simultaneously. We design OMS-DPM, a predictor-based search algorithm, to determine the optimal model schedule given an arbitrary generation time budget and a set of pre-trained models. We demonstrate that OMS-DPM can find model schedules that improve generation quality and speed than prior state-of-the-art methods across CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet, and LSUN datasets. When applied to the public checkpoints of the Stable Diffusion model, we are able to accelerate the sampling by 2x while maintaining the generation quality.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23ab	Enshu Liu, Xuefei Ning, Zinan Lin, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang
High Probability Convergence of Stochastic Gradient Methods	In this work, we describe a generic approach to show convergence with high probability for both stochastic convex and non-convex optimization with sub-Gaussian noise. In previous works for convex optimization, either the convergence is only in expectation or the bound depends on the diameter of the domain. Instead, we show high probability convergence with bounds depending on the initial distance to the optimal solution. The algorithms use step sizes analogous to the standard settings and are universal to Lipschitz functions, smooth functions, and their linear combinations. The method can be applied to the non-convex case. We demonstrate an $O((1+\sigma^{2}\log(1/\delta))/T+\sigma/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate when the number of iterations $T$ is known and an $O((1+\sigma^{2}\log(T/\delta))/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate when $T$ is unknown for SGD, where $1-\delta$ is the desired success probability. These bounds improve over existing bounds in the literature. We also revisit AdaGrad-Norm (Ward et al., 2019) and show a new analysis to obtain a high probability bound that does not require the bounded gradient assumption made in previous works. The full version of our paper contains results for the standard per-coordinate AdaGrad.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23aa	Zijian Liu, Ta Duy Nguyen, Thien Hang Nguyen, Alina Ene, Huy Nguyen

Averaged Method of Multipliers for Bi-Level Optimization without Lower-Level Strong Convexity	Gradient methods have become mainstream techniques for Bi-Level Optimization (BLO) in learning fields. The validity of existing works heavily rely on either a restrictive Lower- Level Strong Convexity (LLSC) condition or on solving a series of approximation subproblems with high accuracy or both. In this work, by averaging the upper and lower level objectives, we propose a single loop Bi-level Averaged Method of Multipliers (sl-BAMM) for BLO that is simple yet efficient for large-scale BLO and gets rid of the limited LLSC restriction. We further provide non-asymptotic convergence analysis of sl-BAMM towards KKT stationary points, and the comparative advantage of our analysis lies in the absence of strong gradient boundedness assumption, which is always required by others. Thus our theory safely captures a wider variety of applications in deep learning, especially where the upper-level objective is quadratic w.r.t. the lower-level variable. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23y	Risheng Liu, Yaohua Liu, Wei Yao, Shangzhi Zeng, Jin Zhang
Understanding the Distillation Process from Deep Generative Models to Tractable Probabilistic Circuits	Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a general and unified computational framework for tractable probabilistic models that support efficient computation of various inference tasks (e.g., computing marginal probabilities). Towards enabling such reasoning capabilities in complex real-world tasks, Liu et al. (2022) propose to distill knowledge (through latent variable assignments) from less tractable but more expressive deep generative models. However, it is still unclear what factors make this distillation work well. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically discover that the performance of a PC can exceed that of its teacher model. Therefore, instead of performing distillation from the most expressive deep generative model, we study what properties the teacher model and the PC should have in order to achieve good distillation performance. This leads to a generic algorithmic improvement as well as other data-type-specific ones over the existing latent variable distillation pipeline. Empirically, we outperform SoTA TPMs by a large margin on challenging image modeling benchmarks. In particular, on ImageNet32, PCs achieve 4.06 bits-per-dimension, which is only 0.34 behind variational diffusion models (Kingma et al., 2021).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23x	Xuejie Liu, Anji Liu, Guy Van Den Broeck, Yitao Liang
Oscillation-free Quantization for Low-bit Vision Transformers	Weight oscillation is a by-product of quantization-aware training, in which quantized weights frequently jump between two quantized levels, resulting in training instability and a sub-optimal final model. We discover that the learnable scaling factor, a widely-used $\textit{de facto}$ setting in quantization aggravates weight oscillation. In this work, we investigate the connection between learnable scaling factor and quantized weight oscillation using ViT, and we additionally find that the interdependence between quantized weights in $\textit{query}$ and $\textit{key}$ of a self-attention layer also makes ViT vulnerable to oscillation. We propose three techniques correspondingly: statistical weight quantization ($\rm StatsQ$) to improve quantization robustness compared to the prevalent learnable-scale-based method; confidence-guided annealing ($\rm CGA$) that freezes the weights with $\textit{high confidence}$ and calms the oscillating weights; and $\textit{query}$-$\textit{key}$ reparameterization ($\rm QKR$) to resolve the query-key intertwined oscillation and mitigate the resulting gradient misestimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our algorithms successfully abate weight oscillation and consistently achieve substantial accuracy improvement on ImageNet. Specifically, our 2-bit DeiT-T/DeiT-S surpass the previous state-of-the-art by 9.8% and 7.7%, respectively. The code is included in the supplementary material and will be released.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23w	Shih-Yang Liu, Zechun Liu, Kwang-Ting Cheng
Dink-Net: Neural Clustering on Large Graphs	Deep graph clustering, which aims to group the nodes of a graph into disjoint clusters with deep neural networks, has achieved promising progress in recent years. However, the existing methods fail to scale to the large graph with million nodes. To solve this problem, a scalable deep graph clustering method (Dink-Net) is proposed with the idea of dilation and shrink. Firstly, by discriminating nodes, whether being corrupted by augmentations, representations are learned in a self-supervised manner. Meanwhile, the cluster centers are initialized as learnable neural parameters. Subsequently, the clustering distribution is optimized by minimizing the proposed cluster dilation loss and cluster shrink loss in an adversarial manner. By these settings, we unify the two-step clustering, i.e., representation learning and clustering optimization, into an end-to-end framework, guiding the network to learn clustering-friendly features. Besides, Dink-Net scales well to large graphs since the designed loss functions adopt the mini-batch data to optimize the clustering distribution even without performance drops. Both experimental results and theoretical analyses demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared to the runner-up, Dink-Net achieves $9.62%$ NMI improvement on the ogbn-papers100M dataset with 111 million nodes and 1.6 billion edges.

Structural Re-weighting Improves Graph Domain Adaptation	In many real-world applications, graph-structured data used for training and testing have differences in distribution, such as in high energy physics (HEP) where simulation data used for training may not match real experiments. Graph domain adaptation (GDA) is a method used to address these differences. However, current GDA primarily works by aligning the distributions of node representations output by a single graph neural network encoder shared across the training and testing domains, which may often yield sub-optimal solutions. This work examines different impacts of distribution shifts caused by either graph structure or node attributes and identifies a new type of shift, named conditional structure shift (CSS), which current GDA approaches are provably sub-optimal to deal with. A novel approach, called structural reweighting (StruRW), is proposed to address this issue and is tested on synthetic graphs, four benchmark datasets, and a new application in HEP. StruRW has shown significant performance improvement over the baselines in the settings with large graph structure shifts, and reasonable performance improvement when node attribute shift dominates.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23u	Shikun Liu, Tianchun Li, Yongbin Feng, Nhan Tran, Han Zhao, Qiang Qiu, Pan Li
Causal Structure Learning for Latent Intervened Non-stationary Data	Causal structure learning can reveal the causal mechanism behind natural systems. It is well studied that the multiple domain data consisting of observational and interventional samples benefit causal identifiability. However, for non-stationary time series data, domain indexes are often unavailable, making it difficult to distinguish observational samples from interventional samples. To address these issues, we propose a novel Latent Intervened Non-stationary learning (LIN) method to make the domain indexes recovery process and the causal structure learning process mutually promote each other. We characterize and justify a possible faithfulness condition to guarantee the identifiability of the proposed LIN method. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines on causal structure learning for latent intervened non-stationary data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23t	Chenxi Liu, Kun Kuang
2D-Shapley: A Framework for Fragmented Data Valuation	Data valuation—quantifying the contribution of individual data sources to certain predictive behaviors of a model—is of great importance to enhancing the transparency of machine learning and designing incentive systems for data sharing. Existing work has focused on evaluating data sources with the shared feature or sample space. How to valuate fragmented data sources of which each only contains partial features and samples remains an open question. We start by presenting a method to calculate the counterfactual of removing a fragment from the aggregated data matrix. Based on the counterfactual calculation, we further propose 2D-Shapley, a theoretical framework for fragmented data valuation that uniquely satisfies some appealing axioms in the fragmented data context. 2D-Shapley empowers a range of new use cases, such as selecting useful data fragments, providing interpretation for sample-wise data values, and fine-grained data issue diagnosis.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23s	Zhihong Liu, Hoang Anh Just, Xiangyu Chang, Xi Chen, Ruoxi Jia
GFlowOut: Dropout with Generative Flow Networks	Bayesian inference offers principled tools to tackle many critical problems with modern neural networks such as poor calibration and generalization, and data inefficiency. However, scaling Bayesian inference to large architectures is challenging and requires restrictive approximations. Monte Carlo Dropout has been widely used as a relatively cheap way to approximate inference and estimate uncertainty with deep neural networks. Traditionally, the dropout mask is sampled independently from a fixed distribution. Recent research shows that the dropout mask can be seen as a latent variable, which can be inferred with variational inference. These methods face two important challenges: (a) the posterior distribution over masks can be highly multi-modal which can be difficult to approximate with standard variational inference and (b) it is not trivial to fully utilize sample-dependent information and correlation among dropout masks to improve posterior estimation. In this work, we propose GFlowOut to address these issues. GFlowOut leverages the recently proposed probabilistic framework of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to learn the posterior distribution over dropout masks. We empirically demonstrate that GFlowOut results in predictive distributions that generalize better to out-of-distribution data and provide uncertainty estimates which lead to better performance in downstream tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23r	Dianbo Liu, Moksh Jain, Bonaventure F.

Online Local Differential Private Quantile Inference via Self-normalization	Based on binary inquiries, we developed an algorithm to estimate population quantiles under Local Differential Privacy (LDP). By self-normalizing, our algorithm provides asymptotically normal estimation with valid inference, resulting in tight confidence intervals without the need for nuisance parameters to be estimated. Our proposed method can be conducted fully online, leading to high computational efficiency and minimal storage requirements with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ space. We also proved an optimality result by an elegant application of one central limit theorem of Gaussian Differential Privacy (GDP) when targeting the frequently encountered median estimation problem. With mathematical proof and extensive numerical testing, we demonstrate the validity of our algorithm both theoretically and experimentally.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23q	Yi Liu, Qirui Hu, Lei Ding, Linglong Kong
Hierarchical Programmatic Reinforcement Learning via Learning to Compose Programs	Aiming to produce reinforcement learning (RL) policies that are human-interpretable and can generalize better to novel scenarios, Trivedi et al. (2021) present a method (LEAPS) that first learns a program embedding space to continuously parameterize diverse programs from a pre-generated program dataset, and then searches for a task-solving program in the learned program embedding space when given a task. Despite the encouraging results, the program policies that LEAPS can produce are limited by the distribution of the program dataset. Furthermore, during searching, LEAPS evaluates each candidate program solely based on its return, failing to precisely reward correct parts of programs and penalize incorrect parts. To address these issues, we propose to learn a meta-policy that composes a series of programs sampled from the learned program embedding space. By learning to compose programs, our proposed hierarchical programmatic reinforcement learning (HPRL) framework can produce program policies that describe out-of-distributionally complex behaviors and directly assign credits to programs that induce desired behaviors. The experimental results in the Karel domain show that our proposed framework outperforms baselines. The ablation studies confirm the limitations of LEAPS and justify our design choices.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23p	Guan-Ting Liu, En-Pei Hu, Pu-Jen Cheng, Hung-Yi Lee, Shao-Hua Sun
NUNO: A General Framework for Learning Parametric PDEs with Non-Uniform Data	The neural operator has emerged as a powerful tool in learning mappings between function spaces in PDEs. However, when faced with real-world physical data, which are often highly non-uniformly distributed, it is challenging to use mesh-based techniques such as the FFT. To address this, we introduce the Non-Uniform Neural Operator (NUNO), a comprehensive framework designed for efficient operator learning with non-uniform data. Leveraging a K-D tree-based domain decomposition, we transform non-uniform data into uniform grids while effectively controlling interpolation error, thereby paralleling the speed and accuracy of learning from non-uniform data. We conduct extensive experiments on 2D elasticity, (2+1)D channel flow, and a 3D multi-physics heatsink, which, to our knowledge, marks a novel exploration into 3D PDE problems with complex geometries. Our framework has reduced error rates by up to 60% and enhanced training speeds by 2x to 30x.

Understanding and Defending Patched-based Adversarial Attacks for Vision Transformer	Vision Transformer (ViT) is an attention-based model architecture that has demonstrated superior performance on many computer vision tasks. However, its security properties, in particular, the robustness against adversarial attacks, are yet to be thoroughly studied. Recent works have shown that ViT is vulnerable to attention-based adversarial patch attacks, which cover 1-3% area of the input image using adversarial patches and degrades the model accuracy to 0%. This work provides a generic study targeting the attention-based patch attack. First, we experimentally observe that adversarial patches only activate in a few layers and become lazy during attention updating. According to experiments, we study the theory of how a small adversarial patch perturbates the whole model. Based on understanding adversarial patch attacks, we propose a simple but efficient defense that correctly detects more than 95% of adversarial patches.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23n	Liang Liu, Yanan Guo, Youtao Zhang, Jun Yang
Constrained Decision Transformer for Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning	Safe reinforcement learning (RL) trains a constraint satisfaction policy by interacting with the environment. We aim to tackle a more challenging problem: learning a safe policy from an offline dataset. We study the offline safe RL problem from a novel multi-objective optimization perspective and propose the $\epsilon$-reducible concept to characterize problem difficulties. The inherent trade-offs between safety and task performance inspire us to propose the constrained decision transformer (CDT) approach, which can dynamically adjust the trade-offs during deployment. Extensive experiments show the advantages of the proposed method in learning an adaptive, safe, robust, and high-reward policy. CDT outperforms its variants and strong offline safe RL baselines by a large margin with the same hyperparameters across all tasks, while keeping the zero-shot adaptation capability to different constraint thresholds, making our approach more suitable for real-world RL under constraints.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23m	Zuxin Liu, Zijian Guo, Yihang Yao, Zhepeng Cen, Wenhao Yu, Tingnan Zhang, Ding Zhao
Towards Robust and Safe Reinforcement Learning with Benign Off-policy Data	Previous work demonstrates that the optimal safe reinforcement learning policy in a noise-free environment is vulnerable and could be unsafe under observational attacks. While adversarial training effectively improves robustness and safety, collecting samples by attacking the behavior agent online could be expensive or prohibitively dangerous in many applications. We propose the robuSt vAriational ofF-policy lEaRning (SAFER) approach, which only requires benign training data without attacking the agent. SAFER obtains an optimal non-parametric variational policy distribution via convex optimization and then uses it to improve the parameterized policy robustly via supervised learning. The two-stage policy optimization facilitates robust training, and extensive experiments on multiple robot platforms show the efficiency of SAFER in learning a robust and safe policy: achieving the same reward with much fewer constraint violations during training than on-policy baselines.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23l	Zuxin Liu, Zijian Guo, Zhepeng Cen, Huan Zhang, Yihang Yao, Hanjiang Hu, Ding Zhao
Opponent-Limited Online Search for Imperfect Information Games	In recent years, online search has been playing an increasingly important role in imperfect information games (IIGs). Previous online search is known as common-knowledge subgame solving, which has to consider all the states in a common-knowledge closure. This is only computationally tolerable for medium size games, such as poker. To handle larger games, order-1 Knowledge-Limited Subgame Solving (1-KLSS) only considers the states in a knowledge-limited closure, which results in a much smaller subgame. However, 1-KLSS is unsafe. In this paper, we first extend 1-KLSS to Safe-1-KLSS and prove its safeness. To make Safe-1-KLSS applicable to even larger games, we propose Opponent-Limited Subgame Solving (OLSS) to limit how the opponent reaches a subgame and how it acts in the subgame. Limiting the opponent's strategy dramatically reduces the subgame size and improves the efficiency of subgame solving while still preserving some safety in the limit. Experiments in medium size poker show that Safe-1-KLSS and OLSS are orders of magnitude faster than previous common-knowledge subgame solving. Also, OLSS significantly improves the online performance in a two-player Mahjong game, whose game size prohibits the use of previous common-knowledge subgame-solving methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23k	Weiming Liu, Haobo Fu, Qiang Fu, Yang Wei
Cones: Concept Neurons in Diffusion Models for Customized Generation	Human brains respond to semantic features of presented stimuli with different neurons. This raises the question of whether deep neural networks admit a similar behavior pattern. To investigate this phenomenon, this paper identifies a small cluster of neurons associated with a specific subject in a diffusion model. We call those neurons the concept neurons. They can be identified by statistics of network gradients to a stimulation connected with the given subject. The concept neurons demonstrate magnetic properties in interpreting and manipulating generation results. Shutting them can directly yield the related subject contextualized in different scenes. Concatenating multiple clusters of concept neurons can vividly generate all related concepts in a single image. Our method attains impressive performance for multi-subject customization, even four or more subjects. For large-scale applications, the concept neurons are environmentally friendly as we only need to store a sparse cluster of int index instead of dense float32 parameter values, reducing storage consumption by 90% compared with previous customized generation methods. Extensive qualitative and quantitative studies on diverse scenarios show the superiority of our method in interpreting and manipulating diffusion models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23j	Zhiheng Liu, Ruili Feng, Kai Zhu, Yifei Zhang, Kecheng Zheng, Yu Liu, Deli Zhao, Jingren Zhou, Yang Cao
Using Perturbation to Improve Goodness-of-Fit Tests based on Kernelized Stein Discrepancy	Kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD) is a score-based discrepancy widely used in goodness-of-fit tests. It can be applied even when the target distribution has an unknown normalising factor, such as in Bayesian analysis. We show theoretically and empirically that the KSD test can suffer from low power when the target and the alternative distributions have the same well-separated modes but differ in mixing proportions. We propose to perturb the observed sample via Markov transition kernels, with respect to which the target distribution is invariant. This allows us to then employ the KSD test on the perturbed sample. We provide numerical evidence that with suitably chosen transition kernels the proposed approach can lead to substantially higher power than the KSD test.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23i	Xing Liu, Andrew B.

A Group Symmetric Stochastic Differential Equation Model for Molecule Multi-modal Pretraining	Molecule pretraining has quickly become the go-to schema to boost the performance of AI-based drug discovery. Naturally, molecules can be represented as 2D topological graphs or 3D geometric point clouds. Although most existing pertaining methods focus on merely the single modality, recent research has shown that maximizing the mutual information (MI) between such two modalities enhances the molecule representation ability. Meanwhile, existing molecule multi-modal pretraining approaches approximate MI based on the representation space encoded from the topology and geometry, thus resulting in the loss of critical structural information of molecules. To address this issue, we propose MoleculeSDE. MoleculeSDE leverages group symmetric (e.g., SE(3)-equivariant and reflection-antisymmetric) stochastic differential equation models to generate the 3D geometries from 2D topologies, and vice versa, directly in the input space. It not only obtains tighter MI bound but also enables prosperous downstream tasks than the previous work. By comparing with 17 pretraining baselines, we empirically verify that MoleculeSDE can learn an expressive representation with state-of-the-art performance on 26 out of 32 downstream tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23h	Shengchao Liu, Weitao Du, Zhi-Ming Ma, Hongyu Guo, Jian Tang
Identifiability of Label Noise Transition Matrix	The noise transition matrix plays a central role in the problem of learning with noisy labels. Among many other reasons, a large number of existing solutions rely on the knowledge of it. Identifying and estimating the transition matrix without ground truth labels is a critical and challenging task. When label noise transition depends on each instance, the problem of identifying the instance-dependent noise transition matrix becomes substantially more challenging. Despite recently proposed solutions for learning from instance-dependent noisy labels, the literature lacks a unified understanding of when such a problem remains identifiable. The goal of this paper is to characterize the identifiability of the label noise transition matrix. Building on Kruskal's identifiability results, we are able to show the necessity of multiple noisy labels in identifying the noise transition matrix at the instance level. We further instantiate the results to explain the successes of the state-of-the-art solutions and how additional assumptions alleviated the requirement of multiple noisy labels. Our result reveals that disentangled features improve identification. This discovery led us to an approach that improves the estimation of the transition matrix using properly disentangled features.

AudioLDM: Text-to-Audio Generation with Latent Diffusion Models	Text-to-audio (TTA) systems have recently gained attention for their ability to synthesize general audio based on text descriptions. However, previous studies in TTA have limited generation quality with high computational costs. In this study, we propose AudioLDM, a TTA system that is built on a latent space to learn continuous audio representations from contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) embeddings. The pretrained CLAP models enable us to train LDMs with audio embeddings while providing text embeddings as the condition during sampling. By learning the latent representations of audio signals without modelling the cross-modal relationship, AudioLDM improves both generation quality and computational efficiency. Trained on AudioCaps with a single GPU, AudioLDM achieves state-of-the-art TTA performance compared to other open-sourced systems, measured by both objective and subjective metrics. AudioLDM is also the first TTA system that enables various text-guided audio manipulations (e.g., style transfer) in a zero-shot fashion. Our implementation and demos are available at https://audioldm.github.io.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23f	Haohe Liu, Zehua Chen, Yi Yuan, Xinhao Mei, Xubo Liu, Danilo Mandic, Wenwu Wang, Mark D Plumbley
Towards Constituting Mathematical Structures for Learning to Optimize	Learning to Optimize (L2O), a technique that utilizes machine learning to learn an optimization algorithm automatically from data, has gained arising attention in recent years. A generic L2O approach parameterizes the iterative update rule and learns the update direction as a black-box network. While the generic approach is widely applicable, the learned model can overfit and may not generalize well to out-of-distribution test sets. In this paper, we derive the basic mathematical conditions that successful update rules commonly satisfy. Consequently, we propose a novel L2O model with a mathematics-inspired structure that is broadly applicable and generalized well to out-of-distribution problems. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the proposed L2O model.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23e	Jialin Liu, Xiaohan Chen, Zhangyang Wang, Wotao Yin, Hanqin Cai
Byzantine-Robust Learning on Heterogeneous Data via Gradient Splitting	Federated learning has exhibited vulnerabilities to Byzantine attacks, where the Byzantine attackers can send arbitrary gradients to a central server to destroy the convergence and performance of the global model. A wealth of robust AGgregation Rules (AGRs) have been proposed to defend against Byzantine attacks. However, Byzantine clients can still circumvent robust AGRs when data is non-Identically and Independently Distributed (non-IID). In this paper, we first reveal the root causes of performance degradation of current robust AGRs in non-IID settings: the curse of dimensionality and gradient heterogeneity. In order to address this issue, we propose GAS, a GrAdient Splitting approach that can successfully adapt existing robust AGRs to non-IID settings. We also provide a detailed convergence analysis when the existing robust AGRs are combined with GAS. Experiments on various real-world datasets verify the efficacy of our proposed GAS. The implementation code is provided in https://github.com/YuchenLiu-a/byzantine-gas.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23d	Yuchen Liu, Chen Chen, Lingjuan Lyu, Fangzhao Wu, Sai Wu, Gang Chen
Learning Representations without Compositional Assumptions	This paper addresses unsupervised representation learning on tabular data containing multiple views generated by distinct sources of measurement. Traditional methods, which tackle this problem using the multi-view framework, are constrained by predefined assumptions that assume feature sets share the same information and representations should learn globally shared factors. However, this assumption is not always valid for real-world tabular datasets with complex dependencies between feature sets, resulting in localized information that is harder to learn. To overcome this limitation, we propose a data-driven approach that learns feature set dependencies by representing feature sets as graph nodes and their relationships as learnable edges. Furthermore, we introduce $\texttt{LEGATO}$, a novel hierarchical graph autoencoder that learns a smaller, latent graph to aggregate information from multiple views dynamically. This approach results in latent graph components that specialize in capturing localized information from different regions of the input, leading to superior downstream performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23c	Tennison Liu, Jeroen Berrevoets, Zhaozhi Qian, Mihaela Van Der Schaar
Shapley Based Residual Decomposition for Instance Analysis	In this paper, we introduce the idea of decomposing the residuals of regression with respect to the data instances instead of features. This allows us to determine the effects of each individual instance on the model and each other, and in doing so makes for a model-agnostic method of identifying instances of interest. In doing so, we can also determine the appropriateness of the model and data in the wider context of a given study. The paper focuses on the possible applications that such a framework brings to the relatively unexplored field of instance analysis in the context of Explainable AI tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23b	Tommy Liu, Amanda S Barnard
Emergent Agentic Transformer from Chain of Hindsight Experience	Large transformer models powered by diverse data and model scale have dominated natural language modeling and computer vision and pushed the frontier of multiple AI areas. In reinforcement learning (RL), despite many efforts into transformer-based policies, a key limitation, however, is that current transformer-based policies cannot learn by directly combining information from multiple sub-optimal trials. In this work, we address this issue using recently proposed chain of hindsight to relabel experience, where we train a transformer on a sequence of trajectory experience ascending sorted according to their total rewards. Our method consists of relabelling target return of each trajectory to the maximum total reward among in sequence of trajectories and training an autoregressive model to predict actions conditioning on past states, actions, rewards, target returns, and task completion tokens, the resulting model, Agentic Transformer (AT), can learn to improve upon itself both at training and test time. As we show on D4RL and ExoRL benchmarks, to the best our knowledge, this is the first time that a simple transformer-based model performs competitively with both temporal-difference and imitation-learning-based approaches, even from sub-optimal data. Our Agentic Transformer also shows a promising scaling trend that bigger models consistently improve results.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23a	Hao Liu, Pieter Abbeel
Deep Graph Representation Learning and Optimization for Influence Maximization	Influence maximization (IM) is formulated as selecting a set of initial users from a social network to maximize the expected number of influenced users. Researchers have made great progresses to design various traditional methods, yet both theoretical design and performance gain are close to their limits. In the past few years, learning-based IM methods have emerged to achieve stronger generalization ability to unknown graphs than traditional ones. However, the development of learning-based IM methods is still limited by fundamental obstacles, including 1) the difficulty of effectively solving the objective function; 2) the difficulty of characterizing the diversified and underlying diffusion patterns; and 3) the difficulty of adapting the solution under various node-centrality-constrained IM variants. To cope with the above challenges, we design a novel framework DeepIM to generatively characterize the latent representation of seed sets, and we propose to learn the diversified information diffusion pattern in a data-driven and end-to-end manner. Finally, we design a novel objective function to infer optimal seed sets under flexible node-centrality-based budget constraints. Extensive analyses are conducted over both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the overall performance of DeepIM.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ling23b	Chen Ling, Junji Jiang, Junxiang Wang, My T.

Graph Mixup with Soft Alignments	We study graph data augmentation by mixup, which has been used successfully on images. A key operation of mixup is to compute a convex combination of a pair of inputs. This operation is straightforward for grid-like data, such as images, but challenging for graph data. The key difficulty lies in the fact that different graphs typically have different numbers of nodes, and thus there lacks a node-level correspondence between graphs. In this work, we propose S-Mixup, a simple yet effective mixup method for graph classification by soft alignments. Specifically, given a pair of graphs, we explicitly obtain node-level correspondence via computing a soft assignment matrix to match the nodes between two graphs. Based on the soft assignments, we transform the adjacency and node feature matrices of one graph, so that the transformed graph is aligned with the other graph. In this way, any pair of graphs can be mixed directly to generate an augmented graph. We conduct systematic experiments to show that S-Mixup can improve the performance and generalization of graph neural networks (GNNs) on various graph classification tasks. In addition, we show that S-Mixup can increase the robustness of GNNs against noisy labels.

Speed-Oblivious Online Scheduling: Knowing (Precise) Speeds is not Necessary	We consider online scheduling on unrelated (heterogeneous) machines in a speed-oblivious setting, where an algorithm is unaware of the exact job-dependent processing speeds. We show strong impossibility results for clairvoyant and non-clairvoyant algorithms and overcome them in models inspired by practical settings: (i) we provide competitive learning-augmented algorithms, assuming that (possibly erroneous) predictions on the speeds are given, and (ii) we provide competitive algorithms for the speed-ordered model, where a single global order of machines according to their unknown job-dependent speeds is known. We prove strong theoretical guarantees and evaluate our findings on a representative heterogeneous multi-core processor. These seem to be the first empirical results for scheduling algorithms with predictions that are evaluated in a non-synthetic hardware environment.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lindermayr23a	Alexander Lindermayr, Nicole Megow, Martin Rapp
Continuation Path Learning for Homotopy Optimization	Homotopy optimization is a traditional method to deal with a complicated optimization problem by solving a sequence of easy-to-hard surrogate subproblems. However, this method can be very sensitive to the continuation schedule design and might lead to a suboptimal solution to the original problem. In addition, the intermediate solutions, often ignored by classic homotopy optimization, could be useful for many real-world applications. In this work, we propose a novel model-based approach to learn the whole continuation path for homotopy optimization, which contains infinite intermediate solutions for any surrogate subproblems. Rather than the classic unidirectional easy-to-hard optimization, our method can simultaneously optimize the original problem and all surrogate subproblems in a collaborative manner. The proposed model also supports the real-time generation of any intermediate solution, which could be desirable for many applications. Experimental studies on different problems show that our proposed method can significantly improve the performance of homotopy optimization and provide extra helpful information to support better decision-making.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lin23n	Xi Lin, Zhiyuan Yang, Xiaoyuan Zhang, Qingfu Zhang
Efficient Approximations of Complete Interatomic Potentials for Crystal Property Prediction	We study property prediction for crystal materials. A crystal structure consists of a minimal unit cell that is repeated infinitely in 3D space. How to accurately represent such repetitive structures in machine learning models remains unresolved. Current methods construct graphs by establishing edges only between nearby nodes, thereby failing to faithfully capture infinite repeating patterns and distant interatomic interactions. In this work, we propose several innovations to overcome these limitations. First, we propose to model physics-principled interatomic potentials directly instead of only using distances as in many existing methods. These potentials include the Coulomb potential, London dispersion potential, and Pauli repulsion potential. Second, we model the complete set of potentials among all atoms, instead of only between nearby atoms as in existing methods. This is enabled by our approximations of infinite potential summations with provable error bounds. We further develop efficient algorithms to compute the approximations. Finally, we propose to incorporate our computations of complete interatomic potentials into message passing neural networks for representation learning. We perform experiments on the JARVIS and Materials Project benchmarks for evaluation. Results show that the use of interatomic potentials and complete interatomic potentials leads to consistent performance improvements with reasonable computational costs.

Fair yet Asymptotically Equal Collaborative Learning	"In collaborative learning with streaming data, nodes (e.g., organizations) jointly and continuously learn a machine learning (ML) model by sharing the latest model updates computed from their latest streaming data. For the more resourceful nodes to be willing to share their model updates, they need to be fairly incentivized. This paper explores an incentive design that guarantees fairness so that nodes receive rewards commensurate to their contributions. Our approach leverages an explore-then-exploit formulation to estimate the nodes' contributions (i.e., exploration) for realizing our theoretically guaranteed fair incentives (i.e., exploitation). However, we observe a ""rich get richer"" phenomenon arising from the existing approaches to guarantee fairness and it discourages the participation of the less resourceful nodes. To remedy this, we additionally preserve asymptotic equality, i.e., less resourceful nodes achieve equal performance eventually to the more resourceful/""rich"" nodes. We empirically demonstrate in two settings with real-world streaming data: federated online incremental learning and federated reinforcement learning, that our proposed approach outperforms existing baselines in fairness and learning performance while remaining competitive in preserving equality."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lin23l	Xiaoqiang Lin, Xinyi Xu, See-Kiong Ng, Chuan-Sheng Foo, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low
Unveiling The Mask of Position-Information Pattern Through the Mist of Image Features	Recent studies have shown that paddings in convolutional neural networks encode absolute position information which can negatively affect the model performance for certain tasks. However, existing metrics for quantifying the strength of positional information remain unreliable and frequently lead to erroneous results. To address this issue, we propose novel metrics for measuring and visualizing the encoded positional information. We formally define the encoded information as Position-information Pattern from Padding (PPP) and conduct a series of experiments to study its properties as well as its formation. The proposed metrics measure the presence of positional information more reliably than the existing metrics based on PosENet and tests in F-Conv. We also demonstrate that for any extant (and proposed) padding schemes, PPP is primarily a learning artifact and is less dependent on the characteristics of the underlying padding schemes.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lin23k	Chieh Hubert Lin, Hung-Yu Tseng, Hsin-Ying Lee, Maneesh Kumar Singh, Ming-Hsuan Yang

Probabilistic Unrolling: Scalable, Inverse-Free Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Latent Gaussian Models	Latent Gaussian models have a rich history in statistics and machine learning, with applications ranging from factor analysis to compressed sensing to time series analysis. The classical method for maximizing the likelihood of these models is the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. For problems with high-dimensional latent variables and large datasets, EM scales poorly because it needs to invert as many large covariance matrices as the number of data points. We introduce probabilistic unrolling, a method that combines Monte Carlo sampling with iterative linear solvers to circumvent matrix inversion. Our theoretical analyses reveal that unrolling and backpropagation through the iterations of the solver can accelerate gradient estimation for maximum likelihood estimation. In experiments on simulated and real data, we demonstrate that probabilistic unrolling learns latent Gaussian models up to an order of magnitude faster than gradient EM, with minimal losses in model performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lin23i	Alexander Lin, Bahareh Tolooshams, Yves Atchade, Demba E.

Safe Offline Reinforcement Learning with Real-Time Budget Constraints	Aiming at promoting the safe real-world deployment of Reinforcement Learning (RL), research on safe RL has made significant progress in recent years. However, most existing works in the literature still focus on the online setting where risky violations of the safety budget are likely to be incurred during training. Besides, in many realworld applications, the learned policy is required to respond to dynamically determined safety budgets (i.e., constraint threshold) in real time. In this paper, we target at the above real-time budget constraint problem under the offline setting, and propose Trajectory-based REal-time Budget Inference (TREBI) as a novel solution that approaches this problem from the perspective of trajectory distribution. Theoretically, we prove an error bound of the estimation on the episodic reward and cost under the offline setting and thus provide a performance guarantee for TREBI. Empirical results on a wide range of simulation tasks and a real-world large-scale advertising application demonstrate the capability of TREBI in solving real-time budget constraint problems under offline settings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lin23h	Qian Lin, Bo Tang, Zifan Wu, Chao Yu, Shangqin Mao, Qianlong Xie, Xingxing Wang, Dong Wang
Accelerated Cyclic Coordinate Dual Averaging with Extrapolation for Composite Convex Optimization	Exploiting partial first-order information in a cyclic way is arguably the most natural strategy to obtain scalable first-order methods.

Theory on Forgetting and Generalization of Continual Learning	"Continual learning (CL), which aims to learn a sequence of tasks, has attracted significant recent attention. However, most work has focused on the experimental performance of CL, and theoretical studies of CL are still limited. In particular, there is a lack of understanding on what factors are important and how they affect ""catastrophic forgetting"" and generalization performance. To fill this gap, our theoretical analysis, under overparameterized linear models, provides the first-known explicit form of the expected forgetting and generalization error for a general CL setup with an arbitrary number of tasks. Further analysis of such a key result yields a number of theoretical explanations about how overparameterization, task similarity, and task ordering affect both forgetting and generalization error of CL. More interestingly, by conducting experiments on real datasets using deep neural networks (DNNs), we show that some of these insights even go beyond the linear models and can be carried over to practical setups. In particular, we use concrete examples to show that our results not only explain some interesting empirical observations in recent studies, but also motivate better practical algorithm designs of CL."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lin23f	Sen Lin, Peizhong Ju, Yingbin Liang, Ness Shroff
Self-supervised Neural Factor Analysis for Disentangling Utterance-level Speech Representations	Self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models such as wav2vec and HuBERT have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on automatic speech recognition (ASR) and proved to be extremely useful in low label-resource settings. However, the success of SSL models has yet to transfer to utterance-level tasks such as speaker, emotion, and language recognition, which still require supervised fine-tuning of the SSL models to obtain good performance. We argue that the problem is caused by the lack of disentangled representations and an utterance-level learning objective for these tasks. Inspired by how HuBERT uses clustering to discover hidden acoustic units, we formulate a factor analysis (FA) model that uses the discovered hidden acoustic units to align the SSL features. The underlying utterance-level representations are disentangled using probabilistic inference on the aligned features. Furthermore, the variational lower bound derived from the FA model provides an utterance-level objective, allowing error gradients to be backpropagated to the Transformer layers to learn highly discriminative acoustic units. When used in conjunction with HuBERT's masked prediction training, our models outperform the current best model, WavLM, on all utterance-level non-semantic tasks on the SUPERB benchmark with only 20% of labeled data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lin23e	Weiwei Lin, Chenhang He, Man-Wai Mak, Youzhi Tu
Text Generation with Diffusion Language Models: A Pre-training Approach with Continuous Paragraph Denoise	In this paper, we introduce a novel dIffusion language modEl pre-training framework for text generation, which we call GENIE. GENIE is a large-scale pre-trained diffusion language model that consists of an encoder and a diffusion-based decoder, which can generate text by gradually transforming a random noise sequence into a coherent text sequence. To pre-train GENIE on a large-scale language corpus, we design a new continuous paragraph denoise objective, which encourages the diffusion-decoder to reconstruct a clean text paragraph from a corrupted version, while preserving the semantic and syntactic coherence. We evaluate GENIE on four downstream text generation benchmarks, namely XSum, CNN/DailyMail, Gigaword, and CommonGen. Our experimental results show that GENIE achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art autoregressive models on these benchmarks, and generates more diverse text samples. The code and models of GENIE are available at https://github.com/microsoft/ProphetNet/tree/master/GENIE.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lin23d	Zhenghao Lin, Yeyun Gong, Yelong Shen, Tong Wu, Zhihao Fan, Chen Lin, Nan Duan, Weizhu Chen
Simplifying Momentum-based Positive-definite Submanifold Optimization with Applications to Deep Learning	Riemannian submanifold optimization with momentum is computationally challenging because, to ensure that the iterates remain on the submanifold, we often need to solve difficult differential equations. Here, we simplify such difficulties for a class of structured symmetric positive-definite matrices with the affine-invariant metric. We do so by proposing a generalized version of the Riemannian normal coordinates that dynamically orthonormalizes the metric and locally converts the problem into an unconstrained problem in the Euclidean space. We use our approach to simplify existing approaches for structured covariances and develop matrix-inverse-free $2^\text{nd}$-order optimizers for deep learning in low precision settings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lin23c	Wu Lin, Valentin Duruisseaux, Melvin Leok, Frank Nielsen, Mohammad Emtiyaz Khan, Mark Schmidt
Hyperbolic Diffusion Embedding and Distance for Hierarchical Representation Learning	Finding meaningful representations and distances of hierarchical data is important in many fields. This paper presents a new method for hierarchical data embedding and distance. Our method relies on combining diffusion geometry, a central approach to manifold learning, and hyperbolic geometry. Specifically, using diffusion geometry, we build multi-scale densities on the data, aimed to reveal their hierarchical structure, and then embed them into a product of hyperbolic spaces. We show theoretically that our embedding and distance recover the underlying hierarchical structure. In addition, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method and its advantages compared to existing methods on graph embedding benchmarks and hierarchical datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lin23b	Ya-Wei Eileen Lin, Ronald R.

Generating Novel, Designable, and Diverse Protein Structures by Equivariantly Diffusing Oriented Residue Clouds	Proteins power a vast array of functional processes in living cells. The capability to create new proteins with designed structures and functions would thus enable the engineering of cellular behavior and development of protein-based therapeutics and materials. Structure-based protein design aims to find structures that are designable (can be realized by a protein sequence), novel (have dissimilar geometry from natural proteins), and diverse (span a wide range of geometries). While advances in protein structure prediction have made it possible to predict structures of novel protein sequences, the combinatorially large space of sequences and structures limits the practicality of search-based methods. Generative models provide a compelling alternative, by implicitly learning the low-dimensional structure of complex data distributions. Here, we leverage recent advances in denoising diffusion probabilistic models and equivariant neural networks to develop Genie, a generative model of protein structures that performs discrete-time diffusion using a cloud of oriented reference frames in 3D space. Through in silico evaluations, we demonstrate that Genie generates protein backbones that are more designable, novel, and diverse than existing models. This indicates that Genie is capturing key aspects of the distribution of protein structure space and facilitates protein design with high success rates. Code for generating new proteins and training new versions of Genie is available at https://github.com/aqlaboratory/genie.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lin23a	Yeqing Lin, Mohammed Alquraishi
Variational Open-Domain Question Answering	Retrieval-augmented models have proven to be effective in natural language processing tasks, yet there remains a lack of research on their optimization using variational inference. We introduce the Variational Open-Domain (VOD) framework for end-to-end training and evaluation of retrieval-augmented models, focusing on open-domain question answering and language modelling. The VOD objective, a self-normalized estimate of the Rényi variational bound, approximates the task marginal likelihood and is evaluated under samples drawn from an auxiliary sampling distribution (cached retriever and/or approximate posterior). It remains tractable, even for retriever distributions defined on large corpora. We demonstrate VOD's versatility by training reader-retriever BERT-sized models on multiple-choice medical exam questions. On the MedMCQA dataset, we outperform the domain-tuned Med-PaLM by +5.3% despite using 2.500$\times$ fewer parameters. Our retrieval-augmented BioLinkBERT model scored 62.9% on the MedMCQA and 55.0% on the MedQA-USMLE. Last, we show the effectiveness of our learned retriever component in the context of medical semantic search.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lievin23a	Valentin Liévin, Andreas Geert Motzfeldt, Ida Riis Jensen, Ole Winther
Revisiting Domain Randomization via Relaxed State-Adversarial Policy Optimization	Domain randomization (DR) is widely used in reinforcement learning (RL) to bridge the gap between simulation and reality by maximizing its average returns under the perturbation of environmental parameters. However, even the most complex simulators cannot capture all details in reality due to finite domain parameters and simplified physical models. Additionally, the existing methods often assume that the distribution of domain parameters belongs to a specific family of probability functions, such as normal distributions, which may not be correct. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach to DR by rethinking it from the perspective of adversarial state perturbation, without the need for reconfiguring the simulator or relying on prior knowledge about the environment. We also address the issue of over-conservatism that can occur when perturbing agents to the worst states during training by introducing a Relaxed State-Adversarial Algorithm that simultaneously maximizes the average-case and worst-case returns. We evaluate our method by comparing it to state-of-the-art methods, providing experimental results and theoretical proofs to verify its effectiveness.

Supervised Metric Learning to Rank for Retrieval via Contextual Similarity Optimization	There is extensive interest in metric learning methods for image retrieval. Many metric learning loss functions focus on learning a correct ranking of training samples, but strongly overfit semantically inconsistent labels and require a large amount of data. To address these shortcomings, we propose a new metric learning method, called contextual loss, which optimizes contextual similarity in addition to cosine similarity. Our contextual loss implicitly enforces semantic consistency among neighbors while converging to the correct ranking. We empirically show that the proposed loss is more robust to label noise, and is less prone to overfitting even when a large portion of train data is withheld. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art across four image retrieval benchmarks and multiple different evaluation settings. Code is available at: https://github.com/Chris210634/metric-learning-using-contextual-similarity	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liao23b	Christopher Liao, Theodoros Tsiligkaridis, Brian Kulis
Statistical Inference and A/B Testing for First-Price Pacing Equilibria	We initiate the study of statistical inference and A/B testing for first-price pacing equilibria (FPPE). The FPPE model captures the dynamics resulting from large-scale first-price auction markets where buyers use pacing-based budget management. Such markets arise in the context of internet advertising, where budgets are prevalent. We propose a statistical framework for the FPPE model, in which a limit FPPE with a continuum of items models the long-run steady-state behavior of the auction platform, and an observable FPPE consisting of a finite number of items provides the data to estimate primitives of the limit FPPE, such as revenue, Nash social welfare (a fair metric of efficiency), and other parameters of interest. We develop central limit theorems and asymptotically valid confidence intervals. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic local minimax optimality of our estimators. We then show that the theory can be used for conducting statistically valid A/B testing on auction platforms. Numerical simulations verify our central limit theorems, and empirical coverage rates for our confidence intervals agree with our theory.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liao23a	Luofeng Liao, Christian Kroer
Less is More: Task-aware Layer-wise Distillation for Language Model Compression	Layer-wise distillation is a powerful tool to compress large models (i.e. teacher models) into small ones (i.e., student models). The student distills knowledge from the teacher by mimicking the hidden representations of the teacher at every intermediate layer. However, layer-wise distillation is difficult. Since the student has a smaller model capacity than the teacher, it is often under-fitted. Furthermore, the hidden representations of the teacher contain redundant information that the student does not necessarily need for the target task's learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Task-aware layEr-wise Distillation (TED). TED designs task-aware filters to align the hidden representations of the student and the teacher at each layer. The filters select the knowledge that is useful for the target task from the hidden representations. As such, TED reduces the knowledge gap between the two models and helps the student to fit better on the target task. We evaluate TED in two scenarios: continual pre-training and fine-tuning. TED demonstrates significant and consistent improvements over existing distillation methods in both scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/cliang1453/task-aware-distillation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liang23j	Chen Liang, Simiao Zuo, Qingru Zhang, Pengcheng He, Weizhu Chen, Tuo Zhao
Conformal Inference is (almost) Free for Neural Networks Trained with Early Stopping	Early stopping based on hold-out data is a popular regularization technique designed to mitigate overfitting and increase the predictive accuracy of neural networks. Models trained with early stopping often provide relatively accurate predictions, but they generally still lack precise statistical guarantees unless they are further calibrated using independent hold-out data. This paper addresses the above limitation with conformalized early stopping: a novel method that combines early stopping with conformal calibration while efficiently recycling the same hold-out data. This leads to models that are both accurate and able to provide exact predictive inferences without multiple data splits nor overly conservative adjustments. Practical implementations are developed for different learning tasks—outlier detection, multi-class classification, regression—and their competitive performance is demonstrated on real data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liang23i	Ziyi Liang, Yanfei Zhou, Matteo Sesia
CLUSTSEG: Clustering for Universal Segmentation	We present CLUSTSEG, a general, transformer-based framework that tackles different image segmentation tasks ($i.e.,$ superpixel, semantic, instance, and panoptic) through a unified, neural clustering scheme. Regarding queries as cluster centers, CLUSTSEG is innovative in two aspects: 1) cluster centers are initialized in heterogeneous ways so as to pointedly address task-specific demands ($e.g.,$ instance- or category-level distinctiveness), yet without modifying the architecture; and 2) pixel-cluster assignment, formalized in a cross-attention fashion, is alternated with cluster center update, yet without learning additional parameters. These innovations closely link CLUSTSEG to EM clustering and make it a transparent and powerful framework that yields superior results across the above segmentation tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liang23h	James Chenhao Liang, Tianfei Zhou, Dongfang Liu, Wenguan Wang
Adversarial Example Does Good: Preventing Painting Imitation from Diffusion Models via Adversarial Examples	Recently, Diffusion Models (DMs) boost a wave in AI for Art yet raise new copyright concerns, where infringers benefit from using unauthorized paintings to train DMs and generate novel paintings in a similar style. To address these emerging copyright violations, in this paper, we are the first to explore and propose to utilize adversarial examples for DMs to protect human-created artworks. Specifically, we first build a theoretical framework to define and evaluate the adversarial examples for DMs. Then, based on this framework, we design a novel algorithm to generate these adversarial examples, named AdvDM, which exploits a Monte-Carlo estimation of adversarial examples for DMs by optimizing upon different latent variables sampled from the reverse process of DMs. Extensive experiments show that the generated adversarial examples can effectively hinder DMs from extracting their features. Therefore, our method can be a powerful tool for human artists to protect their copyright against infringers equipped with DM-based AI-for-Art applications. The code of our method is available on GitHub: https://github.com/mist-project/mist.git.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liang23g	Chumeng Liang, Xiaoyu Wu, Yang Hua, Jiaru Zhang, Yiming Xue, Tao Song, Zhengui Xue, Ruhui Ma, Haibing Guan
Learning Compiler Pass Orders using Coreset and Normalized Value Prediction	Finding the optimal pass sequence of compilation can lead to a significant reduction in program size. Prior works on compilation pass ordering have two major drawbacks. They either require an excessive budget (in terms of the number of compilation passes) at compile time or fail to generalize to unseen programs. In this work, instead of predicting passes sequentially, we directly learn a policy on the pass sequence space, which outperforms the default -Oz flag by an average of 4.5% over a large collection (4683) of unseen code repositories from diverse domains across 14 datasets. To achieve this, we first identify a small set (termed coreset) of pass sequences that generally optimize the size of most programs. Then, a policy is learned to pick the optimal sequences by predicting the normalized values of the pass sequences in the coreset. Our results demonstrate that existing human-designed compiler passes can be improved with a simple yet effective technique that leverages pass sequence space which contains dense rewards, while approaches operating on the individual pass space may suffer from issues of sparse reward, and do not generalize well to held-out programs from different domains.

AdaptDiffuser: Diffusion Models as Adaptive Self-evolving Planners	Diffusion models have demonstrated their powerful generative capability in many tasks, with great potential to serve as a paradigm for offline reinforcement learning. However, the quality of the diffusion model is limited by the insufficient diversity of training data, which hinders the performance of planning and the generalizability to new tasks. This paper introduces AdaptDiffuser, an evolutionary planning method with diffusion that can self-evolve to improve the diffusion model hence a better planner, not only for seen tasks but can also adapt to unseen tasks. AdaptDiffuser enables the generation of rich synthetic expert data for goal-conditioned tasks using guidance from reward gradients. It then selects high-quality data via a discriminator to finetune the diffusion model, which improves the generalization ability to unseen tasks. Empirical experiments on two benchmark environments and two carefully designed unseen tasks in KUKA industrial robot arm and Maze2D environments demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaptDiffuser. For example, AdaptDiffuser not only outperforms the previous art Diffuser by 20.8% on Maze2D and 7.5% on MuJoCo locomotion, but also adapts better to new tasks, e.g., KUKA pick-and-place, by 27.9% without requiring additional expert data.

Accuracy on the Curve: On the Nonlinear Correlation of ML Performance Between Data Subpopulations	"Understanding the performance of machine learning (ML) models across diverse data distributions is critically important for reliable applications. Despite recent empirical studies positing a near-perfect linear correlation between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracies, we empirically demonstrate that this correlation is more nuanced under subpopulation shifts. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis across a variety of datasets, models, and training epochs, we demonstrate that OOD performance often has a nonlinear correlation with ID performance in subpopulation shifts. Our findings, which contrast previous studies that have posited a linear correlation in model performance during distribution shifts, reveal a ""moon shape"" correlation (parabolic uptrend curve) between the test performance on the majority subpopulation and the minority subpopulation. This non-trivial nonlinear correlation holds across model architectures, hyperparameters, training durations, and the imbalance between subpopulations. Furthermore, we found that the nonlinearity of this ""moon shape"" is causally influenced by the degree of spurious correlations in the training data. Our controlled experiments show that stronger spurious correlation in the training data creates more nonlinear performance correlation. We provide complementary experimental and theoretical analyses for this phenomenon, and discuss its implications for ML reliability and fairness. Our work highlights the importance of understanding the nonlinear effects of model improvement on performance in different subpopulations, and has the potential to inform the development of more equitable and responsible machine learning models."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liang23d	Weixin Liang, Yining Mao, Yongchan Kwon, Xinyu Yang, James Zou
A Distribution Optimization Framework for Confidence Bounds of Risk Measures	We present a distribution optimization framework that significantly improves confidence bounds for various risk measures compared to previous methods. Our framework encompasses popular risk measures such as the entropic risk measure, conditional value at risk (CVaR), spectral risk measure, distortion risk measure, equivalent certainty, and rank-dependent expected utility, which are well established in risk-sensitive decision-making literature. To achieve this, we introduce two estimation schemes based on concentration bounds derived from the empirical distribution, specifically using either the Wasserstein distance or the supremum distance. Unlike traditional approaches that add or subtract a confidence radius from the empirical risk measures, our proposed schemes evaluate a specific transformation of the empirical distribution based on the distance. Consequently, our confidence bounds consistently yield tighter results compared to previous methods. We further verify the efficacy of the proposed framework by providing tighter problem-dependent regret bound for the CVaR bandit.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liang23c	Hao Liang, Zhi-Quan Luo
Consistency of Multiple Kernel Clustering	Consistency plays an important role in learning theory. However, in multiple kernel clustering (MKC), the consistency of kernel weights has not been sufficiently investigated. In this work, we fill this gap with a non-asymptotic analysis on the consistency of kernel weights of a novel method termed SimpleMKKM. Under the assumptions of the eigenvalue gap, we give an infinity norm bound as $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(k/\sqrt{n})$, where $k$ is the number of clusters and $n$ is the number of samples. On this basis, we establish an upper bound for the excess clustering risk. Moreover, we study the difference of the kernel weights learned from $n$ samples and $r$ points sampled without replacement, and derive its upper bound as $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(k\cdot\sqrt{1/r-1/n})$. Based on the above results, we propose a novel strategy with Nyström method to enable SimpleMKKM to handle large-scale datasets with a theoretical learning guarantee. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed large-scale strategy.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liang23b	Weixuan Liang, Xinwang Liu, Yong Liu, Chuan Ma, Yunping Zhao, Zhe Liu, En Zhu
Low Complexity Homeomorphic Projection to Ensure Neural-Network Solution Feasibility for Optimization over (Non-)Convex Set	There has been growing interest in employing neural network (NN) to directly solve constrained optimization problems with low run-time complexity. However, it is non-trivial to ensure NN solutions strictly satisfying problem constraints due to inherent NN prediction errors. Existing feasibility-ensuring methods either are computationally expensive or lack performance guarantee. In this paper, we propose homeomorphic projection as a low-complexity scheme to guarantee NN solution feasibility for optimization over a general set homeomorphic to a unit ball, covering all compact convex sets and certain classes of nonconvex sets. The idea is to (i) learn a minimum distortion homeomorphic mapping between the constraint set and a unit ball using an invertible NN (INN), and then (ii) perform a simple bisection operation concerning the unit ball so that the INN-mapped final solution is feasible with respect to the constraint set with minor distortion-induced optimality loss. We prove the feasibility guarantee and bound the optimality loss under mild conditions. Simulation results, including those for non-convex AC-OPF problems in power grid operation, show that homeomorphic projection outperforms existing methods in solution feasibility and run-time complexity, while achieving similar optimality loss.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liang23a	Enming Liang, Minghua Chen, Steven Low
Structured Cooperative Learning with Graphical Model Priors	"We study how to train personalized models for different tasks on decentralized devices with limited local data. We propose ""Structured Cooperative Learning (SCooL)"", in which a cooperation graph across devices is generated by a graphical model prior to automatically coordinate mutual learning between devices. By choosing graphical models enforcing different structures, we can derive a rich class of existing and novel decentralized learning algorithms via variational inference. In particular, we show three instantiations of SCooL that adopt Dirac distribution, stochastic block model (SBM), and attention as the prior generating cooperation graphs. These EM-type algorithms alternate between updating the cooperation graph and cooperative learning of local models. They can automatically capture the cross-task correlations among devices by only monitoring their model updating in order to optimize the cooperation graph. We evaluate SCooL and compare it with existing decentralized learning methods on an extensive set of benchmarks, on which SCooL always achieves the highest accuracy of personalized models and significantly outperforms other baselines on communication efficiency.

Trustworthy Policy Learning under the Counterfactual No-Harm Criterion	Trustworthy policy learning has significant importance in making reliable and harmless treatment decisions for individuals. Previous policy learning approaches aim at the well-being of subgroups by maximizing the utility function (e.g., conditional average causal effects, post-view click-through&conversion rate in recommendations), however, individual-level counterfactual no-harm criterion has rarely been discussed. In this paper, we first formalize the counterfactual no-harm criterion for policy learning from a principal stratification perspective. Next, we propose a novel upper bound for the fraction negatively affected by the policy and show the consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator. Based on the estimators for the policy utility and harm upper bounds, we further propose a policy learning approach that satisfies the counterfactual no-harm criterion, and prove its consistency to the optimal policy reward for parametric and non-parametric policy classes, respectively. Extensive experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed policy learning approach for satisfying the counterfactual no-harm criterion.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23ay	Haoxuan Li, Chunyuan Zheng, Yixiao Cao, Zhi Geng, Yue Liu, Peng Wu
Internally Rewarded Reinforcement Learning	We study a class of reinforcement learning problems where the reward signals for policy learning are generated by a discriminator that is dependent on and jointly optimized with the policy. This interdependence between the policy and the discriminator leads to an unstable learning process because reward signals from an immature discriminator are noisy and impede policy learning, and conversely, an under-optimized policy impedes discriminator learning. We call this learning setting $\textit{Internally Rewarded Reinforcement Learning}$ (IRRL) as the reward is not provided directly by the environment but $\textit{internally}$ by the discriminator. In this paper, we formally formulate IRRL and present a class of problems that belong to IRRL. We theoretically derive and empirically analyze the effect of the reward function in IRRL and based on these analyses propose the clipped linear reward function. Experimental results show that the proposed reward function can consistently stabilize the training process by reducing the impact of reward noise, which leads to faster convergence and higher performance compared with baselines in diverse tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23ax	Mengdi Li, Xufeng Zhao, Jae Hee Lee, Cornelius Weber, Stefan Wermter
Optimal Arms Identification with Knapsacks	Best Arm Identification (BAI) is a general online pure exploration framework to identify optimal decisions among candidates via sequential interactions. We pioneer the Optimal Arms identification with Knapsacks (OAK) problem, which extends the BAI setting to model the resource consumption. We present a novel OAK algorithm and prove the upper bound of our algorithm by exploring the relationship between selecting optimal actions and the structure of the feasible region. Our analysis introduces a new complexity measure, which builds a bridge between the OAK setting and bandits with knapsacks problem. We establish the instance-dependent lower bound for the OAK problem based on the new complexity measure. Our results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a near-optimal probability bound for the OAK problem. In addition, we demonstrate that our algorithm recovers or improves the state-of-the-art upper bounds for several special cases, including the simple OAK setting and some classical pure exploration problems.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23aw	Shaoang Li, Lan Zhang, Yingqi Yu, Xiangyang Li
Offline Reinforcement Learning with Closed-Form Policy Improvement Operators	Behavior constrained policy optimization has been demonstrated to be a successful paradigm for tackling Offline Reinforcement Learning. By exploiting historical transitions, a policy is trained to maximize a learned value function while constrained by the behavior policy to avoid a significant distributional shift. In this paper, we propose our closed-form policy improvement operators. We make a novel observation that the behavior constraint naturally motivates the use of first-order Taylor approximation, leading to a linear approximation of the policy objective. Additionally, as practical datasets are usually collected by heterogeneous policies, we model the behavior policies as a Gaussian Mixture and overcome the induced optimization difficulties by leveraging the LogSumExp's lower bound and Jensen's Inequality, giving rise to a closed-form policy improvement operator. We instantiate both one-step and iterative offline RL algorithms with our novel policy improvement operators and empirically demonstrate their effectiveness over state-of-the-art algorithms on the standard D4RL benchmark.

Cooperative Open-ended Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Coordination	Zero-shot coordination in cooperative artificial intelligence (AI) remains a significant challenge, which means effectively coordinating with a wide range of unseen partners. Previous algorithms have attempted to address this challenge by optimizing fixed objectives within a population to improve strategy or behaviour diversity. However, these approaches can result in a loss of learning and an inability to cooperate with certain strategies within the population, known as cooperative incompatibility. To address this issue, we propose the Cooperative Open-ended LEarning (COLE) framework, which constructs open-ended objectives in cooperative games with two players from the perspective of graph theory to assess and identify the cooperative ability of each strategy. We further specify the framework and propose a practical algorithm that leverages knowledge from game theory and graph theory. Furthermore, an analysis of the learning process of the algorithm shows that it can efficiently overcome cooperative incompatibility. The experimental results in the Overcooked game environment demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods when coordinating with different-level partners.

Does a Neural Network Really Encode Symbolic Concepts?	Recently, a series of studies have tried to extract interactions between input variables modeled by a DNN and define such interactions as concepts encoded by the DNN. However, strictly speaking, there still lacks a solid guarantee whether such interactions indeed represent meaningful concepts. Therefore, in this paper, we examine the trustworthiness of interaction concepts from four perspectives. Extensive empirical studies have verified that a well-trained DNN usually encodes sparse, transferable, and discriminative concepts, which is partially aligned with human intuition. The code is released at https://github.com/sjtu-xai-lab/interaction-concept.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23at	Mingjie Li, Quanshi Zhang
Understanding the Complexity Gains of Single-Task RL with a Curriculum	Reinforcement learning (RL) problems can be challenging without well-shaped rewards. Prior work on provably efficient RL methods generally proposes to address this issue with dedicated exploration strategies. However, another way to tackle this challenge is to reformulate it as a multi-task RL problem, where the task space contains not only the challenging task of interest but also easier tasks that implicitly function as a curriculum. Such a reformulation opens up the possibility of running existing multi-task RL methods as a more efficient alternative to solving a single challenging task from scratch. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework that reformulates a single-task RL problem as a multi-task RL problem defined by a curriculum. Under mild regularity conditions on the curriculum, we show that sequentially solving each task in the multi-task RL problem is more computationally efficient than solving the original single-task problem, without any explicit exploration bonuses or other exploration strategies. We also show that our theoretical insights can be translated into an effective practical learning algorithm that can accelerate curriculum learning on simulated robotic tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23as	Qiyang Li, Yuexiang Zhai, Yi Ma, Sergey Levine
Alternating Local Enumeration (TnALE): Solving Tensor Network Structure Search with Fewer Evaluations	"Tensor network (TN) is a powerful framework in machine learning, but selecting a good TN model, known as TN structure search (TN-SS), is a challenging and computationally intensive task. The recent approach TNLS (Li et al., 2022) showed promising results for this task. However, its computational efficiency is still unaffordable, requiring too many evaluations of the objective function. We propose TnALE, a surprisingly simple algorithm that updates each structure-related variable alternately by local enumeration, greatly reducing the number of evaluations compared to TNLS. We theoretically investigate the descent steps for TNLS and TnALE, proving that both the algorithms can achieve linear convergence up to a constant if a sufficient reduction of the objective is reached in each neighborhood. We further compare the evaluation efficiency of TNLS and TnALE, revealing that $\Omega(2^K)$ evaluations are typically required in TNLS for reaching the objective reduction, while ideally $O(KR)$ evaluations are sufficient in TnALE, where $K$ denotes the dimension of search space and $R$ reflects the ""low-rankness"" of the neighborhood. Experimental results verify that TnALE can find practically good TN structures with vastly fewer evaluations than the state-of-the-art algorithms."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23ar	Chao Li, Junhua Zeng, Chunmei Li, Cesar F Caiafa, Qibin Zhao
Nesterov Meets Optimism: Rate-Optimal Separable Minimax Optimization	We propose a new first-order optimization algorithm — AcceleratedGradient-OptimisticGradient (AG-OG) Descent Ascent—for separable convex-concave minimax optimization. The main idea of our algorithm is to carefully leverage the structure of the minimax problem, performing Nesterov acceleration on the individual component and optimistic gradient on the coupling component. Equipped with proper restarting, we show that AG-OG achieves the optimal convergence rate (up to a constant) for a variety of settings, including bilinearly coupled strongly convex-strongly concave minimax optimization (bi-SC-SC), bilinearly coupled convex-strongly concave minimax optimization (bi-C-SC), and bilinear games. We also extend our algorithm to the stochastic setting and achieve the optimal convergence rate in both bi-SC-SC and bi-C-SC settings. AG-OG is the first single-call algorithm with optimal convergence rates in both deterministic and stochastic settings for bilinearly coupled minimax optimization problems.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23aq	Chris Junchi Li, Angela Yuan, Gauthier Gidel, Quanquan Gu, Michael Jordan
LoSparse: Structured Compression of Large Language Models based on Low-Rank and Sparse Approximation	Transformer models have achieved remarkable results in various natural language tasks, but they are often prohibitively large, requiring massive memories and computational resources. To re- duce the size and complexity of these models, we propose LoSparse (Low-Rank and Sparse ap- proximation), a novel model compression tech- nique that approximates a weight matrix by the sum of a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix. Our method combines the advantages of both low- rank approximations and pruning, while avoid- ing their limitations. Low-rank approximation compresses the coherent and expressive parts in neurons, while pruning removes the incoherent and non-expressive parts in neurons. Pruning enhances the diversity of low-rank approxima- tions, and low-rank approximation prevents prun- ing from losing too many expressive neurons. We evaluate our method on natural language under- standing, question answering, and natural lan- guage generation tasks. We show that it signif- icantly outperforms existing compression meth- ods.

Achieving Hierarchy-Free Approximation for Bilevel Programs with Equilibrium Constraints	In this paper, we develop an approximation scheme for solving bilevel programs with equilibrium constraints, which are generally difficult to solve. Among other things, calculating the first-order derivative in such a problem requires differentiation across the hierarchy, which is computationally intensive, if not prohibitive. To bypass the hierarchy, we propose to bound such bilevel programs, equivalent to multiple-followers Stackelberg games, with two new hierarchy-free problems: a $T$-step Cournot game and a $T$-step monopoly model. Since they are standard equilibrium or optimization problems, both can be efficiently solved via first-order methods. Importantly, we show that the bounds provided by these problems — the upper bound by the $T$-step Cournot game and the lower bound by the $T$-step monopoly model — can be made arbitrarily tight by increasing the step parameter $T$ for a wide range of problems. We prove that a small $T$ usually suffices under appropriate conditions to reach an approximation acceptable for most practical purposes. Eventually, the analytical insights are highlighted through numerical examples.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23ao	Jiayang Li, Jing Yu, Boyi Liu, Yu Nie, Zhaoran Wang
FedVS: Straggler-Resilient and Privacy-Preserving Vertical Federated Learning for Split Models	In a vertical federated learning (VFL) system consisting of a central server and many distributed clients, the training data are vertically partitioned such that different features are privately stored on different clients. The problem of split VFL is to train a model split between the server and the clients. This paper aims to address two major challenges in split VFL: 1) performance degradation due to straggling clients during training; and 2) data and model privacy leakage from clients' uploaded data embeddings. We propose FedVS to simultaneously address these two challenges. The key idea of FedVS is to design secret sharing schemes for the local data and models, such that information-theoretical privacy against colluding clients and curious server is guaranteed, and the aggregation of all clients' embeddings is reconstructed losslessly, via decrypting computation shares from the non-straggling clients. Extensive experiments on various types of VFL datasets (including tabular, CV, and multi-view) demonstrate the universal advantages of FedVS in straggler mitigation and privacy protection over baseline protocols.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23an	Songze Li, Duanyi Yao, Jin Liu
Learning for Edge-Weighted Online Bipartite Matching with Robustness Guarantees	Many problems, such as online ad display, can be formulated as online bipartite matching. The crucial challenge lies in the nature of sequentially-revealed online item information, based on which we make irreversible matching decisions at each step. While numerous expert online algorithms have been proposed with bounded worst-case competitive ratios, they may not offer satisfactory performance in average cases. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to improve the average performance, but it lacks robustness and can perform arbitrarily poorly. In this paper, we propose a novel RL-based approach to edge-weighted online bipartite matching with robustness guarantees (LOMAR), achieving both good average-case and worst-case performance. The key novelty of LOMAR is a new online switching operation which, based on a judicious condition to hedge against future uncertainties, decides whether to follow the expert's decision or the RL decision for each online item. We prove that for any $\rho\in[0,1]$, LOMAR is $\rho$-competitive against any given expert online algorithm. To improve the average performance, we train the RL policy by explicitly considering the online switching operation. Finally, we run empirical experiments to demonstrate the advantages of LOMAR compared to existing baselines.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23am	Pengfei Li, Jianyi Yang, Shaolei Ren
Transcendental Idealism of Planner: Evaluating Perception from Planning Perspective for Autonomous Driving	Evaluating the performance of perception modules in autonomous driving is one of the most critical tasks in developing the complex intelligent system. While module-level unit test metrics adopted from traditional computer vision tasks are feasible to some extent, it remains far less explored to measure the impact of perceptual noise on the driving quality of autonomous vehicles in a consistent and holistic manner. In this work, we propose a principled framework that provides a coherent and systematic understanding of the impact an error in the perception module imposes on an autonomous agent's planning that actually controls the vehicle. Specifically, the planning process is formulated as expected utility maximisation, where all input signals from upstream modules jointly provide a world state description, and the planner strives for the optimal action by maximising the expected utility determined by both world states and actions. We show that, under practical conditions, the objective function can be represented as an inner product between the world state description and the utility function in a Hilbert space. This geometric interpretation enables a novel way to analyse the impact of noise in world state estimation on planning and leads to a universal metric for evaluating perception. The whole framework resembles the idea of transcendental idealism in the classical philosophical literature, which gives the name to our approach.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23al	Weixin Li, Xiaodong Yang
Horizon-free Learning for Markov Decision Processes and Games: Stochastically Bounded Rewards and Improved Bounds	Horizon dependence is an important difference between reinforcement learning and other machine learning paradigms. Yet, existing results tackling the (exact) horizon dependence either assume that the reward is bounded per step, introducing unfair comparison, or assume strict total boundedness that requires the sum of rewards to be bounded	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23ak	Shengshi Li, Lin Yang
SMURF-THP: Score Matching-based UnceRtainty quantiFication for Transformer Hawkes Process	Transformer Hawkes process models have shown to be successful in modeling event sequence data. However, most of the existing training methods rely on maximizing the likelihood of event sequences, which involves calculating some intractable integral. Moreover, the existing methods fail to provide uncertainty quantification for model predictions, e.g., confidence interval for the predicted event's arrival time. To address these issues, we propose SMURF-THP, a score-based method for learning Transformer Hawkes process and quantifying prediction uncertainty. Specifically, SMURF-THP learns the score function of the event's arrival time based on a score-matching objective that avoids the intractable computation. With such a learnt score function, we can sample arrival time of events from the predictive distribution. This naturally allows for the quantification of uncertainty by computing confidence intervals over the generated samples. We conduct extensive experiments in both event type prediction and uncertainty quantification on time of arrival.

GraphCleaner: Detecting Mislabelled Samples in Popular Graph Learning Benchmarks	Label errors have been found to be prevalent in popular text, vision, and audio datasets, which heavily influence the safe development and evaluation of machine learning algorithms. Despite increasing efforts towards improving the quality of generic data types, such as images and texts, the problem of mislabel detection in graph data remains underexplored. To bridge the gap, we explore mislabelling issues in popular real-world graph datasets and propose GraphCleaner, a post-hoc method to detect and correct these mislabelled nodes in graph datasets. GraphCleaner combines the novel ideas of 1) Synthetic Mislabel Dataset Generation, which seeks to generate realistic mislabels; and 2) Neighborhood-Aware Mislabel Detection, where neighborhood dependency is exploited in both labels and base classifier predictions. Empirical evaluations on 6 datasets and 6 experimental settings demonstrate that GraphCleaner outperforms the closest baseline, with an average improvement of $0.14$ in F1 score, and $0.16$ in MCC. On real-data case studies, GraphCleaner detects real and previously unknown mislabels in popular graph benchmarks: PubMed, Cora, CiteSeer and OGB-arxiv; we find that at least 6.91% of PubMed data is mislabelled or ambiguous, and simply removing these mislabelled data can boost evaluation performance from 86.71% to 89.11%.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23ai	Yuwen Li, Miao Xiong, Bryan Hooi
Propensity Matters: Measuring and Enhancing Balancing for Recommendation	Propensity-based weighting methods have been widely studied and demonstrated competitive performance in debiased recommendations. Nevertheless, there are still many questions to be addressed. How to estimate the propensity more conducive to debiasing performance? Which metric is more reasonable to measure the quality of the learned propensities? Is it better to make the cross-entropy loss as small as possible when learning propensities? In this paper, we first discuss the potential problems of the previously widely adopted metrics for learned propensities, and propose balanced-mean-squared-error (BMSE) metric for debiased recommendations. Based on BMSE, we propose IPS-V2 and DR-V2 as the estimators of unbiased loss, and theoretically show that IPS-V2 and DR-V2 have greater propensity balancing and smaller variance without sacrificing additional bias. We further propose a co-training method for learning balanced representation and unbiased prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets including a large industrial dataset, and the results show that our approach boosts the balancing property and results in enhanced debiasing performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23ah	Haoxuan Li, Yanghao Xiao, Chunyuan Zheng, Peng Wu, Peng Cui
Learning Antidote Data to Individual Unfairness	Fairness is essential for machine learning systems deployed in high-stake applications. Among all fairness notions, individual fairness, deriving from a consensus that 'similar individuals should be treated similarly,' is a vital notion to describe fair treatment for individual cases. Previous studies typically characterize individual fairness as a prediction-invariant problem when perturbing sensitive attributes on samples, and solve it by Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) paradigm. However, such adversarial perturbations along a direction covering sensitive information used in DRO do not consider the inherent feature correlations or innate data constraints, therefore could mislead the model to optimize at off-manifold and unrealistic samples. In light of this drawback, in this paper, we propose to learn and generate antidote data that approximately follows the data distribution to remedy individual unfairness. These generated on-manifold antidote data can be used through a generic optimization procedure along with original training data, resulting in a pure pre-processing approach to individual unfairness, or can also fit well with the in-processing DRO paradigm. Through extensive experiments on multiple tabular datasets, we demonstrate our method resists individual unfairness at a minimal or zero cost to predictive utility compared to baselines.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23ag	Peizhao Li, Ethan Xia, Hongfu Liu
Architecture-Agnostic Masked Image Modeling From ViT back to CNN	Masked image modeling, an emerging self-supervised pre-training method, has shown impressive success across numerous downstream vision tasks with Vision transformers. Its underlying idea is simple: a portion of the input image is masked out and then reconstructed via a pre-text task. However, the working principle behind MIM is not well explained, and previous studies insist that MIM primarily works for the Transformer family but is incompatible with CNNs. In this work, we observe that MIM essentially teaches the model to learn better middle-order interactions among patches for more generalized feature extraction. We then propose an Architecture-Agnostic Masked Image Modeling framework (A$^2$MIM), which is compatible with both Transformers and CNNs in a unified way. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that A$^2$MIM learns better representations without explicit design and endows the backbone model with the stronger capability to transfer to various downstream tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23af	Siyuan Li, Di Wu, Fang Wu, Zelin Zang, Stan Z.

Divide and Conquer Dynamic Programming: An Almost Linear Time Change Point Detection Methodology in High Dimensions	We develop a novel, general and computationally efficient framework, called Divide and Conquer Dynamic Programming (DCDP), for localizing change points in time series data with high-dimensional features. DCDP deploys a class of greedy algorithms that are applicable to a broad variety of high-dimensional statistical models and can enjoy almost linear computational complexity. We investigate the performance of DCDP in three commonly studied change point settings in high dimensions: the mean model, the Gaussian graphical model, and the linear regression model. In all three cases, we derive non-asymptotic bounds for the accuracy of the DCDP change point estimators. We demonstrate that the DCDP procedures consistently estimate the change points with sharp, and in some cases, optimal rates while incurring significantly smaller computational costs than the best available algorithms. Our findings are supported by extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23ae	Wanshan Li, Daren Wang, Alessandro Rinaldo
Hierarchical Diffusion for Offline Decision Making	Offline reinforcement learning typically introduces a hierarchical structure to solve the long-horizon problem so as to address its thorny issue of variance accumulation. Problems of deadly triad, limited data and reward sparsity, however, still remain, rendering the design of effective, hierarchical offline RL algorithms for general-purpose policy learning a formidable challenge. In this paper, we first formulate the problem of offline long-horizon decision-$\mathbf{M}$ak$\mathbf{I}$ng from the perspective of conditional generative modeling by incorporating goals into the control-as-inference graphic models. A $\mathbf{H}$ierarchical trajectory-level $\mathbf{D}$iffusion probabilistic model is then proposed with classifier-free guidance. HDMI employs a cascade framework that utilizes the reward-conditional goal diffuser for the subgoal discovery and the goal-conditional trajectory diffuser for generating the corresponding action sequence of subgoals. Planning-based subgoal extraction and transformer-based diffusion are employed to deal with the sub-optimal data pollution and long-range subgoal dependencies in the goal diffusion. Numerical experiments verify the advantages of HDMI on long-horizon decision-making compared to SOTA offline RL methods and conditional generative models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23ad	Wenhao Li, Xiangfeng Wang, Bo Jin, Hongyuan Zha
Low-Switching Policy Gradient with Exploration via Online Sensitivity Sampling	Policy optimization methods are powerful algorithms in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for their flexibility to deal with policy parameterization and ability to handle model misspecification. However, these methods usually suffer from slow convergence rates and poor sample complexity. Hence it is important to design provably sample efficient algorithms for policy optimization. Yet, recent advances for this problems have only been successful in tabular and linear setting, whose benign structures cannot be generalized to non-linearly parameterized policies. In this paper, we address this problem by leveraging recent advances in value-based algorithms, including bounded eluder-dimension and online sensitivity sampling, to design a low-switching sample-efficient policy optimization algorithm,	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23ac	Yunfan Li, Yiran Wang, Yu Cheng, Lin Yang
Efficient Quantum Algorithms for Quantum Optimal Control	In this paper, we present efficient quantum algorithms that are exponentially faster than classical algorithms for solving the quantum optimal control problem. This problem involves finding the control variable that maximizes a physical quantity at time $T$, where the system is governed by a time-dependent Schrödinger equation. This type of control problem also has an intricate relation with machine learning. Our algorithms are based on a time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation method and a fast gradient-estimation algorithm. We also provide a comprehensive error analysis to quantify the total error from various steps, such as the finite-dimensional representation of the control function, the discretization of the Schrödinger equation, the numerical quadrature, and optimization. Our quantum algorithms require fault-tolerant quantum computers.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23ab	Xiantao Li, Chunhao Wang
How Powerful are Shallow Neural Networks with Bandlimited Random Weights?	We investigate the expressive power of depth-2 bandlimited random neural networks. A random net is a neural network where the hidden layer parameters are frozen with random assignment, and only the output layer parameters are trained by loss minimization. Using random weights for a hidden layer is an effective method to avoid non-convex optimization in standard gradient descent learning. It has also been adopted in recent deep learning theories. Despite the well-known fact that a neural network is a universal approximator, in this study, we mathematically show that when hidden parameters are distributed in a bounded domain, the network may not achieve zero approximation error. In particular, we derive a new nontrivial approximation error lower bound. The proof utilizes the technique of ridgelet analysis, a harmonic analysis method designed for neural networks. This method is inspired by fundamental principles in classical signal processing, specifically the idea that signals with limited bandwidth may not always be able to perfectly reconstruct the original signal. We corroborate our theoretical results with various simulation studies, and generally, two main take-home messages are offered: (i) Not any distribution for selecting random weights is feasible to build a universal approximator; (ii) A suitable assignment of random weights exists but to some degree is associated with the complexity of the target function.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23aa	Ming Li, Sho Sonoda, Feilong Cao, Yu Guang Wang, Jiye Liang
Federated Adversarial Learning: A Framework with Convergence Analysis	Federated learning (FL) is a trending training paradigm to utilize decentralized training data. FL allows clients to update model parameters locally for several epochs, then share them to a global model for aggregation. This training paradigm with multi-local step updating before aggregation exposes unique vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is a popular and effective method to improve the robustness of networks against adversaries. In this work, we formulate a general form of federated adversarial learning (FAL) that is adapted from adversarial learning in the centralized setting. On the client side of FL training, FAL has an inner loop to generate adversarial samples for adversarial training and an outer loop to update local model parameters. On the server side, FAL aggregates local model updates and broadcast the aggregated model. We design a global robust training loss and formulate FAL training as a min-max optimization problem. Unlike the convergence analysis in classical centralized training that relies on the gradient direction, it is significantly harder to analyze the convergence in FAL for three reasons: 1) the complexity of min-max optimization, 2) model not updating in the gradient direction due to the multi-local updates on the client-side before aggregation and 3) inter-client heterogeneity. We address these challenges by using appropriate gradient approximation and coupling techniques and present the convergence analysis in the over-parameterized regime. Our main result theoretically shows that the minimum loss under our algorithm can converge to $\epsilon$ small with chosen learning rate and communication rounds. It is noteworthy that our analysis is feasible for non-IID clients.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23z	Xiaoxiao Li, Zhao Song, Jiaming Yang
On the Initialization of Graph Neural Networks	Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have displayed considerable promise in graph representation learning across various applications. The core learning process requires the initialization of model weight matrices within each GNN layer, which is typically accomplished via classic initialization methods such as Xavier initialization. However, these methods were originally motivated to stabilize the variance of hidden embeddings and gradients across layers of Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to avoid vanishing gradients and maintain steady information flow. In contrast, within the GNN context classical initializations disregard the impact of the input graph structure and message passing on variance. In this paper, we analyze the variance of forward and backward propagation across GNN layers and show that the variance instability of GNN initializations comes from the combined effect of the activation function, hidden dimension, graph structure and message passing. To better account for these influence factors, we propose a new initialization method for Variance Instability Reduction within GNN Optimization (Virgo), which naturally tends to equate forward and backward variances across successive layers. We conduct comprehensive experiments on 15 datasets to show that Virgo can lead to superior model performance and more stable variance at initialization on node classification, link prediction and graph classification tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23y	Jiahang Li, Yakun Song, Xiang Song, David Wipf
Deep Anomaly Detection under Labeling Budget Constraints	Selecting informative data points for expert feedback can significantly improve the performance of anomaly detection (AD) in various contexts, such as medical diagnostics or fraud detection. In this paper, we determine a set of theoretical conditions under which anomaly scores generalize from labeled queries to unlabeled data. Motivated by these results, we propose a data labeling strategy with optimal data coverage under labeling budget constraints. In addition, we propose a new learning framework for semi-supervised AD. Extensive experiments on image, tabular, and video data sets show that our approach results in state-of-the-art semi-supervised AD performance under labeling budget constraints.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23x	Aodong Li, Chen Qiu, Marius Kloft, Padhraic Smyth, Stephan Mandt, Maja Rudolph
Meta Learning of Interface Conditions for Multi-Domain Physics-Informed Neural Networks	Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are emerging as popular mesh-free solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs). Recent extensions decompose the domain, apply different PINNs to solve the problem in each subdomain, and stitch the subdomains at the interface. Thereby, they can further alleviate the problem complexity, reduce the computational cost, and allow parallelization. However, the performance of multi-domain PINNs is sensitive to the choice of the interface conditions. While quite a few conditions have been proposed, there is no suggestion about how to select the conditions according to specific problems. To address this gap, we propose META Learning of Interface Conditions (METALIC), a simple, efficient yet powerful approach to dynamically determine appropriate interface conditions for solving a family of parametric PDEs. Specifically, we develop two contextual multi-arm bandit (MAB) models. The first one applies to the entire training course, and online updates a Gaussian process (GP) reward that given the PDE parameters and interface conditions predicts the performance. We prove a sub-linear regret bound for both UCB and Thompson sampling, which in theory guarantees the effectiveness of our MAB. The second one partitions the training into two stages, one is the stochastic phase and the other deterministic phase; we update a GP reward for each phase to enable different condition selections at the two stages to further bolster the flexibility and performance. We have shown the advantage of METALIC on four bench-mark PDE families.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23w	Shibo Li, Michael Penwarden, Yiming Xu, Conor Tillinghast, Akil Narayan, Mike Kirby, Shandian Zhe

Optimal Convergence Rates for Agnostic Nyström Kernel Learning	Nyström low-rank approximation has shown great potential in processing large-scale kernel matrix and neural networks. However, there lacks a unified analysis for Nyström approximation, and the asymptotical minimax optimality for Nyström methods usually require a strict condition, assuming that the target regression lies exactly in the hypothesis space. In this paper, to tackle these problems, we provide a refined generalization analysis for Nyström approximation in the agnostic setting, where the target regression may be out of the hypothesis space. Specifically, we show Nyström approximation can still achieve the capacity-dependent optimal rates in the agnostic setting. To this end, we first prove the capacity-dependent optimal guarantees of Nyström approximation with the standard uniform sampling, which covers both loss functions and applies to some agnostic settings. Then, using data-dependent sampling, for example, leverage scores sampling, we derive the capacity-dependent optimal rates that apply to the whole range of the agnostic setting. To our best knowledge, the capacity-dependent optimality for the whole range of the agnostic setting is first achieved and novel in Nyström approximation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23u	Jian Li, Yong Liu, Weiping Wang
Distribution-dependent McDiarmid-type Inequalities for Functions of Unbounded Interaction	The concentration of measure inequalities serves an essential role in statistics and machine learning. This paper gives unbounded analogues of the McDiarmid-type exponential inequalities for three popular classes of distributions, namely sub-Gaussian, sub-exponential and heavy-tailed distributions. The inequalities in the sub-Gaussian and sub-exponential cases are distribution-dependent compared with the recent results, and the inequalities in the heavy-tailed case are not available in the previous works. The usefulness of the inequalities is illustrated through applications to the sample mean, U-statistics and V-statistics.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23t	Shaojie Li, Yong Liu
Revisiting Weighted Aggregation in Federated Learning with Neural Networks	In federated learning (FL), weighted aggregation of local models is conducted to generate a global model, and the aggregation weights are normalized (the sum of weights is 1) and proportional to the local data sizes. In this paper, we revisit the weighted aggregation process and gain new insights into the training dynamics of FL. First, we find that the sum of weights can be smaller than 1, causing global weight shrinking effect (analogous to weight decay) and improving generalization. We explore how the optimal shrinking factor is affected by clients' data heterogeneity and local epochs. Second, we dive into the relative aggregation weights among clients to depict the clients' importance. We develop client coherence to study the learning dynamics and find a critical point that exists. Before entering the critical point, more coherent clients play more essential roles in generalization. Based on the above insights, we propose an effective method for Federated Learning with Learnable Aggregation Weights, named as FedLAW. Extensive experiments verify that our method can improve the generalization of the global model by a large margin on different datasets and models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23s	Zexi Li, Tao Lin, Xinyi Shang, Chao Wu
Nearly Optimal Algorithms with Sublinear Computational Complexity for Online Kernel Regression	The trade-off between regret and computational cost is a fundamental problem for online kernel regression, and previous algorithms worked on the trade-off can not keep optimal regret bounds at a sublinear computational complexity. In this paper, we propose two new algorithms, AOGD-ALD and NONS-ALD, which can keep nearly optimal regret bounds at a sublinear computational complexity, and give sufficient conditions under which our algorithms work. Both algorithms dynamically maintain a group of nearly orthogonal basis used to approximate the kernel mapping, and keep nearly optimal regret bounds by controlling the approximate error. The number of basis depends on the approximate error and the decay rate of eigenvalues of the kernel matrix. If the eigenvalues decay exponentially, then AOGD-ALD and NONS-ALD separately achieves a regret of $O(\sqrt{L(f)})$ and $O(\mathrm{d}_{\mathrm{eff}}(\mu)\ln{T})$ at a computational complexity in $O(\ln^2{T})$. If the eigenvalues decay polynomially with degree $p\geq 1$, then our algorithms keep the same regret bounds at a computational complexity in $o(T)$ in the case of $p>4$ and $p\geq 10$, respectively. $L(f)$ is the cumulative losses of $f$ and $\mathrm{d}_{\mathrm{eff}}(\mu)$ is the effective dimension of the problem. The two regret bounds are nearly optimal and are not comparable.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23r	Junfan Li, Shizhong Liao
BLIP-2: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training with Frozen Image Encoders and Large Language Models	The cost of vision-and-language pre-training has become increasingly prohibitive due to end-to-end training of large-scale models. This paper proposes BLIP-2, a generic and efficient pre-training strategy that bootstraps vision-language pre-training from off-the-shelf frozen pre-trained image encoders and frozen large language models. BLIP-2 bridges the modality gap with a lightweight Querying Transformer, which is pre-trained in two stages. The first stage bootstraps vision-language representation learning from a frozen image encoder. The second stage bootstraps vision-to-language generative learning from a frozen language model. BLIP-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language tasks, despite having significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing methods. For example, our model outperforms Flamingo80B by 8.7% on zero-shot VQAv2 with 54x fewer trainable parameters. We also demonstrate the model's emerging capabilities of zero-shot image-to-text generation that can follow natural language instructions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23q	Junnan Li, Dongxu Li, Silvio Savarese, Steven Hoi
How Do Transformers Learn Topic Structure: Towards a Mechanistic Understanding	"While the successes of transformers across many domains are indisputable, accurate understanding of the learning mechanics is still largely lacking. Their capabilities have been probed on benchmarks which include a variety of structured and reasoning tasks—but mathematical understanding is lagging substantially behind. Recent lines of work have begun studying representational aspects of this question: that is, the size/depth/complexity of attention-based networks to perform certain tasks. However, there is no guarantee the learning dynamics will converge to the constructions proposed. In our paper, we provide fine-grained mechanistic understanding of how transformers learn ""semantic structure"", understood as capturing co-occurrence structure of words. Precisely, we show, through a combination of mathematical analysis and experiments on Wikipedia data and synthetic data modeled by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), that the embedding layer and the self-attention layer encode the topical structure. In the former case, this manifests as higher average inner product of embeddings between same-topic words. In the latter, it manifests as higher average pairwise attention between same-topic words. The mathematical results involve several assumptions to make the analysis tractable, which we verify on data, and might be of independent interest as well."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23p	Yuchen Li, Yuanzhi Li, Andrej Risteski
Analysis of Error Feedback in Federated Non-Convex Optimization with Biased Compression: Fast Convergence and Partial Participation	"In practical federated learning (FL) systems, the communication cost between the clients and the central server can often be a bottleneck. In this paper, we focus on biased gradient compression in non-convex FL problems. In the classical distributed learning, the method of error feedback (EF) is a common technique to remedy the downsides of biased gradient compression, but the performance of EF in FL still lacks systematic investigation. In this work, we study a compressed FL scheme with error feedback, named Fed-EF, with two variants depending on the global model optimizer. While directly applying biased compression in FL leads to poor convergence, we show that Fed-EF is able to match the convergence rate of the full-precision FL counterpart with a linear speedup w.r.t. the number of clients. Experiments verify that Fed-EF achieves the same performance as the full-precision FL approach, at the substantially reduced communication cost. Moreover, we develop a new analysis of the EF under partial participation (PP), an important scenario in FL. Under PP, the convergence rate of Fed-EF exhibits an extra slow-down factor due to a so-called ""stale error compensation"" effect, which is also justified in our experiments. Our results provide insights on a theoretical limitation of EF, and possible directions for improvements."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23o	Xiaoyun Li, Ping Li
Local Vertex Colouring Graph Neural Networks	In recent years, there has been a significant amount of research focused on expanding the expressivity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) beyond the Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) framework. While many of these studies have yielded advancements in expressivity, they have frequently come at the expense of decreased efficiency or have been restricted to specific types of graphs. In this study, we investigate the expressivity of GNNs from the perspective of graph search. Specifically, we propose a new vertex colouring scheme and demonstrate that classical search algorithms can efficiently compute graph representations that extend beyond the 1-WL. We show the colouring scheme inherits useful properties from graph search that can help solve problems like graph biconnectivity. Furthermore, we show that under certain conditions, the expressivity of GNNs increases hierarchically with the radius of the search neighbourhood. To further investigate the proposed scheme, we develop a new type of GNN based on two search strategies, breadth-first search and depth-first search, highlighting the graph properties they can capture on top of 1-WL.

Improving Hyperparameter Learning under Approximate Inference in Gaussian Process Models	Approximate inference in Gaussian process (GP) models with non-conjugate likelihoods gets entangled with the learning of the model hyperparameters. We improve hyperparameter learning in GP models and focus on the interplay between variational inference (VI) and the learning target. While VI's lower bound to the marginal likelihood is a suitable objective for inferring the approximate posterior, we show that a direct approximation of the marginal likelihood as in Expectation Propagation (EP) is a better learning objective for hyperparameter optimization. We design a hybrid training procedure to bring the best of both worlds: it leverages conjugate-computation VI for inference and uses an EP-like marginal likelihood approximation for hyperparameter learning. We compare VI, EP, Laplace approximation, and our proposed training procedure and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal across a wide range of data sets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23m	Rui Li, S.

Transformers as Algorithms: Generalization and Stability in In-context Learning	In-context learning (ICL) is a type of prompting where a transformer model operates on a sequence of (input, output) examples and performs inference on-the-fly. In this work, we formalize in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem where a transformer model implicitly constructs a hypothesis function at inference-time. We first explore the statistical aspects of this abstraction through the lens of multitask learning: We obtain generalization bounds for ICL when the input prompt is (1) a sequence of i.i.d. (input, label) pairs or (2) a trajectory arising from a dynamical system. The crux of our analysis is relating the excess risk to the stability of the algorithm implemented by the transformer. We characterize when transformer/attention architecture provably obeys the stability condition and also provide empirical verification. For generalization on unseen tasks, we identify an inductive bias phenomenon in which the transfer learning risk is governed by the task complexity and the number of MTL tasks in a highly predictable manner. Finally, we provide numerical evaluations that (1) demonstrate transformers can indeed implement near-optimal algorithms on classical regression problems with i.i.d. and dynamic data, (2) provide insights on stability, and (3) verify our theoretical predictions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23l	Yingcong Li, Muhammed Emrullah Ildiz, Dimitris Papailiopoulos, Samet Oymak
Near-optimal Conservative Exploration in Reinforcement Learning under Episode-wise Constraints	This paper investigates conservative exploration in reinforcement learning where the performance of the learning agent is guaranteed to be above a certain threshold throughout the learning process. It focuses on the tabular episodic Markov Decision Process (MDP) setting that has finite states and actions. With the knowledge of an existing safe baseline policy, an algorithms termed as StepMix is proposed to balance the exploitation and exploration while ensuring that the conservative constraint is never violated in each episode with high probability. StepMix features a unique design of a mixture policy that adaptively and smoothly interpolates between the baseline policy and the optimistic policy. Theoretical analysis shows that StepMix achieves near-optimal regret order as in the constraint-free setting, indicating that obeying the stringent episode-wise conservative constraint does not compromise the learning performance. Besides, a randomization based EpsMix algorithm is also proposed and shown the achieve the same performance as StepMix. The algorithm design and theoretical analysis are further extended to the setting where the baseline policy is not given a priori but must be learned from an offline dataset, and it is proved that similar conservative guarantee and regret can be achieved if the offline dataset is sufficiently large. Experiment results corroborate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed conservative exploration strategies.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23k	Donghao Li, Ruiquan Huang, Cong Shen, Jing Yang
Adversarial Collaborative Learning on Non-IID Features	Federated Learning (FL) has been a popular approach to enable collaborative learning on multiple parties without exchanging raw data. However, the model performance of FL may degrade a lot due to non-IID data. While many FL algorithms focus on non-IID labels, FL on non-IID features has largely been overlooked. Different from typical FL approaches, the paper proposes a new learning concept called ADCOL (Adversarial Collaborative Learning) for non-IID features. Instead of adopting the widely used model-averaging scheme, ADCOL conducts training in an adversarial way: the server aims to train a discriminator to distinguish the representations of the parties, while the parties aim to generate a common representation distribution. Our experiments show that ADCOL achieves better performance than state-of-the-art FL algorithms on non-IID features.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23j	Qinbin Li, Bingsheng He, Dawn Song
RACE: Improve Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Representation Asymmetry and Collaborative Evolution	Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has demonstrated its effectiveness in learning collaboration, but it often struggles with low-quality reward signals and high non-stationarity. In contrast, Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) has shown better convergence, robustness, and signal quality insensitivity. This paper introduces a hybrid framework, Representation Asymmetry and Collaboration Evolution (RACE), which combines EA and MARL for efficient collaboration. RACE maintains a MARL team and a population of EA teams. To enable efficient knowledge sharing and policy exploration, RACE decomposes the policies of different teams controlling the same agent into a shared nonlinear observation representation encoder and individual linear policy representations. To address the partial observation issue, we introduce Value-Aware Mutual Information Maximization to enhance the shared representation with useful information about superior global states. EA evolves the population using novel agent-level crossover and mutation operators, offering diverse experiences for MARL. Concurrently, MARL optimizes its policies and injects them into the population for evolution. The experiments on challenging continuous and discrete tasks demonstrate that RACE significantly improves the basic algorithms, consistently outperforming other algorithms.

FAIRER: Fairness as Decision Rationale Alignment	Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant progress, but often suffer from fairness issues, as deep models typically show distinct accuracy differences among certain subgroups (e.g., males and females). Existing research addresses this critical issue by employing fairness-aware loss functions to constrain the last-layer outputs and directly regularize DNNs. Although the fairness of DNNs is improved, it is unclear how the trained network makes a fair prediction, which limits future fairness improvements. In this paper, we investigate fairness from the perspective of decision rationale and define the parameter parity score to characterize the fair decision process of networks by analyzing neuron influence in various subgroups. Extensive empirical studies show that the unfair issue could arise from the unaligned decision rationales of subgroups. Existing fairness regularization terms fail to achieve decision rationale alignment because they only constrain last-layer outputs while ignoring intermediate neuron alignment. To address the issue, we formulate the fairness as a new task, i.e., decision rationale alignment that requires DNNs' neurons to have consistent responses on subgroups at both intermediate processes and the final prediction. To make this idea practical during optimization, we relax the naive objective function and propose gradient-guided parity alignment, which encourages gradient-weighted consistency of neurons across subgroups. Extensive experiments on a variety of datasets show that our method can significantly enhance fairness while sustaining a high level of accuracy and outperforming other approaches by a wide margin.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23h	Tianlin Li, Qing Guo, Aishan Liu, Mengnan Du, Zhiming Li, Yang Liu
Minimum Width of Leaky-ReLU Neural Networks for Uniform Universal Approximation	The study of universal approximation properties (UAP) for neural networks (NN) has a long history. When the network width is unlimited, only a single hidden layer is sufficient for UAP. In contrast, when the depth is unlimited, the width for UAP needs to be not less than the critical width $w^*_{\min}=\max(d_x,d_y)$, where $d_x$ and $d_y$ are the dimensions of the input and output, respectively. Recently, (Cai, 2022) shows that a leaky-ReLU NN with this critical width can achieve UAP for $L^p$ functions on a compact domain $\mathcal{K}$,	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23g	Li’Ang Li, Yifei Duan, Guanghua Ji, Yongqiang Cai
Parallel $Q$-Learning: Scaling Off-policy Reinforcement Learning under Massively Parallel Simulation	Reinforcement learning is time-consuming for complex tasks due to the need for large amounts of training data. Recent advances in GPU-based simulation, such as Isaac Gym, have sped up data collection thousands of times on a commodity GPU. Most prior works have used on-policy methods like PPO due to their simplicity and easy-to-scale nature. Off-policy methods are more sample-efficient, but challenging to scale, resulting in a longer wall-clock training time. This paper presents a novel Parallel Q-Learning (PQL) scheme that outperforms PPO in terms of wall-clock time and maintains superior sample efficiency. The driving force lies in the parallelization of data collection, policy function learning, and value function learning. Different from prior works on distributed off-policy learning, such as Apex, our scheme is designed specifically for massively parallel GPU-based simulation and optimized to work on a single workstation. In experiments, we demonstrate the capability of scaling up Q-learning methods to tens of thousands of parallel environments and investigate important factors that can affect learning speed, including the number of parallel environments, exploration strategies, batch size, GPU models, etc. The code is available at https://github.com/Improbable-AI/pql.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23f	Zechu Li, Tao Chen, Zhang-Wei Hong, Anurag Ajay, Pulkit Agrawal
Learning Preconditioners for Conjugate Gradient PDE Solvers	Efficient numerical solvers for partial differential equations empower science and engineering. One commonly employed numerical solver is the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm, whose performance is largely affected by the preconditioner quality. However, designing high-performing preconditioner with traditional numerical methods is highly non-trivial, often requiring problem-specific knowledge and meticulous matrix operations. We present a new method that leverages learning-based approach to obtain an approximate matrix factorization to the system matrix to be used as a preconditioner in the context of PCG solvers. Our high-level intuition comes from the shared property between preconditioners and network-based PDE solvers that excels at obtaining approximate solutions at a low computational cost. Such observation motivates us to represent preconditioners as graph neural networks (GNNs). In addition, we propose a new loss function that rewrites traditional preconditioner metrics to incorporate inductive bias from PDE data distributions, enabling effective training of high-performing preconditioners. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of our proposed approach on solving various 2D and 3D linear second-order PDEs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23e	Yichen Li, Peter Yichen Chen, Tao Du, Wojciech Matusik
Prototype-oriented unsupervised anomaly detection for multivariate time series	Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) of multivariate time series (MTS) aims to learn robust representations of normal multivariate temporal patterns. Existing UAD methods try to learn a fixed set of mappings for each MTS, entailing expensive computation and limited model adaptation. To address this pivotal issue, we propose a prototype-oriented UAD (PUAD) method under a probabilistic framework. Specifically, instead of learning the mappings for each MTS, the proposed PUAD views multiple MTSs as the distribution over a group of prototypes, which are extracted to represent a diverse set of normal patterns. To learn and regulate the prototypes, PUAD introduces a reconstruction-based unsupervised anomaly detection approach, which incorporates a prototype-oriented optimal transport method into a Transformer-powered probabilistic dynamical generative framework. Leveraging meta-learned transferable prototypes, PUAD can achieve high model adaptation capacity for new MTSs. Experiments on five public MTS datasets all verify the effectiveness of the proposed UAD method.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23d	Yuxin Li, Wenchao Chen, Bo Chen, Dongsheng Wang, Long Tian, Mingyuan Zhou
Internet Explorer: Targeted Representation Learning on the Open Web	Vision models typically rely on fine-tuning general-purpose models pre-trained on large, static datasets. These general-purpose models only capture the knowledge within their pre-training datasets, which are tiny, out-of-date snapshots of the Internet—where billions of images are uploaded each day. We suggest an alternate approach: rather than hoping our static datasets transfer to our desired tasks after large-scale pre-training, we propose dynamically utilizing the Internet to quickly train a small-scale model that does extremely well on a target dataset. Our approach, called Internet Explorer, explores the web in a self-supervised manner to progressively find relevant examples that improve performance on a desired target dataset. It cycles between searching for images on the Internet with text queries, self-supervised training on downloaded images, determining which images were useful, and prioritizing what to search for next. We evaluate Internet Explorer across several datasets and show that it outperforms or matches CLIP oracle performance using just a single GPU desktop to actively query the Internet for 30-40 hours.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23c	Alexander Cong Li, Ellis Langham Brown, Alexei A Efros, Deepak Pathak
MAHALO: Unifying Offline Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning from Observations	We study a new paradigm for sequential decision making, called offline policy learning from observations (PLfO). Offline PLfO aims to learn policies using datasets with substandard qualities: 1) only a subset of trajectories is labeled with rewards, 2) labeled trajectories may not contain actions, 3) labeled trajectories may not be of high quality, and 4) the data may not have full coverage. Such imperfection is common in real-world learning scenarios, and offline PLfO encompasses many existing offline learning setups, including offline imitation learning (IL), offline IL from observations (ILfO), and offline reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we present a generic approach to offline PLfO, called Modality-agnostic Adversarial Hypothesis Adaptation for Learning from Observations (MAHALO). Built upon the pessimism concept in offline RL, MAHALO optimizes the policy using a performance lower bound that accounts for uncertainty due to the dataset's insufficient coverage. We implement this idea by adversarially training data-consistent critic and reward functions, which forces the learned policy to be robust to data deficiency. We show that MAHALO consistently outperforms or matches specialized algorithms across a variety of offline PLfO tasks in theory and experiments.

TIPS: Topologically Important Path Sampling for Anytime Neural Networks	Anytime neural networks (AnytimeNNs) are a promising solution to adaptively adjust the model complexity at runtime under various hardware resource constraints. However, the manually-designed AnytimeNNs are biased by designers' prior experience and thus provide sub-optimal solutions. To address the limitations of existing hand-crafted approaches, we first model the training process of AnytimeNNs as a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) and use it to identify the paths that contribute the most to the training of AnytimeNNs. Based on this new DTMC-based analysis, we further propose TIPS, a framework to automatically design AnytimeNNs under various hardware constraints. Our experimental results show that TIPS can improve the convergence rate and test accuracy of AnytimeNNs. Compared to the existing AnytimeNNs approaches, TIPS improves the accuracy by 2%-6.6% on multiple datasets and achieves SOTA accuracy-FLOPs tradeoffs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23a	Guihong Li, Kartikeya Bhardwaj, Yuedong Yang, Radu Marculescu
GLOBE-CE: A Translation Based Approach for Global Counterfactual Explanations	Counterfactual explanations have been widely studied in explainability, with a range of application dependent methods prominent in fairness, recourse and model understanding. The major shortcoming associated with these methods, however, is their inability to provide explanations beyond the local or instance-level. While many works touch upon the notion of a global explanation, typically suggesting to aggregate masses of local explanations in the hope of ascertaining global properties, few provide frameworks that are both reliable and computationally tractable. Meanwhile, practitioners are requesting more efficient and interactive explainability tools. We take this opportunity to propose Global & Efficient Counterfactual Explanations (GLOBE-CE), a flexible framework that tackles the reliability and scalability issues associated with current state-of-the-art, particularly on higher dimensional datasets and in the presence of continuous features. Furthermore, we provide a unique mathematical analysis of categorical feature translations, utilising it in our method. Experimental evaluation with publicly available datasets and user studies demonstrate that GLOBE-CE performs significantly better than the current state-of-the-art across multiple metrics (e.g., speed, reliability).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ley23a	Dan Ley, Saumitra Mishra, Daniele Magazzeni
Efficient Rate Optimal Regret for Adversarial Contextual MDPs Using Online Function Approximation	We present the OMG-CMDP! algorithm for regret minimization in adversarial Contextual MDPs. The algorithm operates under the minimal assumptions of realizable function class and access to online least squares and log loss regression oracles. Our algorithm is efficient (assuming efficient online regression oracles), simple and robust to approximation errors. It enjoys an $\widetilde{O}(H^{2.5} \sqrt{ T|S||A| ( \mathcal{R}_{TH}(\mathcal{O}) + H \log(\delta^{-1}) )})$ regret guarantee, with $T$ being the number of episodes, $S$ the state space, $A$ the action space, $H$ the horizon and $\mathcal{R}_{TH}(\mathcal{O}) = \mathcal{R}_{TH}(\mathcal{O}_{sq}^\mathcal{F}) + \mathcal{R}_{TH}(\mathcal{O}_{log}^\mathcal{P})$ is the sum of the square and log-loss regression oracles' regret, used to approximate the context-dependent rewards and dynamics, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first efficient rate optimal regret minimization algorithm for adversarial CMDPs that operates under the minimal standard assumption of online function approximation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/levy23a	Orin Levy, Alon Cohen, Asaf Cassel, Yishay Mansour
Fast Inference from Transformers via Speculative Decoding	Inference from large autoregressive models like Transformers is slow - decoding K tokens takes K serial runs of the model. In this work we introduce speculative decoding - an algorithm to sample from autoregressive models faster without any changes to the outputs, by computing several tokens in parallel. At the heart of our approach lie the observations that (1) hard language-modeling tasks often include easier subtasks that can be approximated well by more efficient models, and (2) using speculative execution and a novel sampling method, we can make exact decoding from the large models faster, by running them in parallel on the outputs of the approximation models, potentially generating several tokens concurrently, and without changing the distribution. Our method can accelerate existing off-the-shelf models without retraining or architecture changes. We demonstrate it on T5-XXL and show a 2X-3X acceleration compared to the standard T5X implementation, with identical outputs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/leviathan23a	Yaniv Leviathan, Matan Kalman, Yossi Matias
Sampling-Based Accuracy Testing of Posterior Estimators for General Inference	"Parameter inference, i.e. inferring the posterior distribution of the parameters of a statistical model given some data, is a central problem to many scientific disciplines. Posterior inference with generative models is an alternative to methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo, both for likelihood-based and simulation-based inference. However, assessing the accuracy of posteriors encoded in generative models is not straightforward. In this paper, we introduce ""Tests of Accuracy with Random Points"" (TARP) coverage testing as a method to estimate coverage probabilities of generative posterior estimators. Our method differs from previously-existing coverage-based methods, which require posterior evaluations. We prove that our approach is necessary and sufficient to show that a posterior estimator is accurate. We demonstrate the method on a variety of synthetic examples, and show that TARP can be used to test the results of posterior inference analyses in high-dimensional spaces. We also show that our method can detect inaccurate inferences in cases where existing methods fail."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lemos23a	Pablo Lemos, Adam Coogan, Yashar Hezaveh, Laurence Perreault-Levasseur

Generalization Analysis for Contrastive Representation Learning	Recently, contrastive learning has found impressive success in advancing the state of the art in solving various machine learning tasks. However, the existing generalization analysis is very limited or even not meaningful. In particular, the existing generalization error bounds depend linearly on the number $k$ of negative examples while it was widely shown in practice that choosing a large $k$ is necessary to guarantee good generalization of contrastive learning in downstream tasks. In this paper, we establish novel generalization bounds for contrastive learning which do not depend on $k$, up to logarithmic terms. Our analysis uses structural results on empirical covering numbers and Rademacher complexities to exploit the Lipschitz continuity of loss functions. For self-bounding Lipschitz loss functions, we further improve our results by developing optimistic bounds which imply fast rates in a low noise condition. We apply our results to learning with both linear representation and nonlinear representation by deep neural networks, for both of which we derive Rademacher complexity bounds to get improved generalization bounds.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lei23a	Yunwen Lei, Tianbao Yang, Yiming Ying, Ding-Xuan Zhou
Unsupervised Skill Discovery for Learning Shared Structures across Changing Environments	Learning shared structures across changing environments enables an agent to efficiently retain obtained knowledge and transfer it between environments. A skill is a promising concept to represent shared structures. Several recent works proposed unsupervised skill discovery algorithms that can discover useful skills without a reward function. However, they focused on discovering skills in stationary environments or assumed that a skill being trained is fixed within an episode, which is insufficient to learn and represent shared structures. In this paper, we introduce a new unsupervised skill discovery algorithm that discovers a set of skills that can represent shared structures across changing environments. Our algorithm trains incremental skills and encourages a new skill to expand state coverage obtained with compositions of previously learned skills. We also introduce a skill evaluation process to prevent our skills from containing redundant skills, a common issue in previous work. Our experimental results show that our algorithm acquires skills that represent shared structures across changing maze navigation and locomotion environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our skills are more useful than baselines on downstream tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lee23r	Sang-Hyun Lee, Seung-Woo Seo
Implicit Jacobian regularization weighted with impurity of probability output	The success of deep learning is greatly attributed to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), yet it remains unclear how SGD finds well-generalized models.

On the Correctness of Automatic Differentiation for Neural Networks with Machine-Representable Parameters	Recent work has shown that forward- and reverse- mode automatic differentiation (AD) over the reals is almost always correct in a mathematically precise sense. However, actual programs work with machine-representable numbers (e.g., floating-point numbers), not reals. In this paper, we study the correctness of AD when the parameter space of a neural network consists solely of machine-representable numbers. In particular, we analyze two sets of parameters on which AD can be incorrect: the incorrect set on which the network is differentiable but AD does not compute its derivative, and the non-differentiable set on which the network is non-differentiable. For a neural network with bias parameters, we first prove that the incorrect set is always empty. We then prove a tight bound on the size of the non-differentiable set, which is linear in the number of non-differentiabilities in activation functions, and give a simple necessary and sufficient condition for a parameter to be in this set. We further prove that AD always computes a Clarke subderivative even on the non-differentiable set. We also extend these results to neural networks possibly without bias parameters.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lee23p	Wonyeol Lee, Sejun Park, Alex Aiken

QASA: Advanced Question Answering on Scientific Articles	Reasoning is the crux of intellectual thinking. While question answering (QA) tasks are prolific with various computational models and benchmark datasets, they mostly tackle factoid or shallow QA without asking deeper understanding. Dual process theory asserts that human reasoning consists of associative thinking to collect relevant pieces of knowledge and logical reasoning to consciously conclude grounding on evidential rationale. Based on our intensive think-aloud study that revealed the three types of questions: surface, testing, and deep questions, we first propose the QASA benchmark that consists of 1798 novel question answering pairs that require full-stack reasoning on scientific articles in AI and ML fields. Then we propose the QASA approach that tackles the full-stack reasoning with large language models via associative selection, evidential rationale-generation, and systematic composition. Our experimental results show that QASA's full-stack inference outperforms the state-of-the-art InstructGPT by a big margin. We also find that rationale-generation is critical for the performance gain, claiming how we should rethink advanced question answering. The dataset is available at https://github.com/lgresearch/QASA.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lee23n	Yoonjoo Lee, Kyungjae Lee, Sunghyun Park, Dasol Hwang, Jaehyeon Kim, Hong-In Lee, Moontae Lee
HETAL: Efficient Privacy-preserving Transfer Learning with Homomorphic Encryption	Transfer learning is a de facto standard method for efficiently training machine learning models for data-scarce problems by adding and fine-tuning new classification layers to a model pre-trained on large datasets. Although numerous previous studies proposed to use homomorphic encryption to resolve the data privacy issue in transfer learning in the machine learning as a service setting, most of them only focused on encrypted inference. In this study, we present HETAL, an efficient Homomorphic Encryption based Transfer Learning algorithm, that protects the client's privacy in training tasks by encrypting the client data using the CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme. HETAL is the first practical scheme that strictly provides encrypted training, adopting validation-based early stopping and achieving the accuracy of nonencrypted training. We propose an efficient encrypted matrix multiplication algorithm, which is 1.8 to 323 times faster than prior methods, and a highly precise softmax approximation algorithm with increased coverage. The experimental results for five well-known benchmark datasets show total training times of 567–3442 seconds, which is less than an hour.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lee23m	Seewoo Lee, Garam Lee, Jung Woo Kim, Junbum Shin, Mun-Kyu Lee
On the Importance of Feature Decorrelation for Unsupervised Representation Learning in Reinforcement Learning	Recently, unsupervised representation learning (URL) has improved the sample efficiency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) by pretraining a model from a large unlabeled dataset. The underlying principle of these methods is to learn temporally predictive representations by predicting future states in the latent space. However, an important challenge of this approach is the representational collapse, where the subspace of the latent representations collapses into a low-dimensional manifold. To address this issue, we propose a novel URL framework that causally predicts future states while increasing the dimension of the latent manifold by decorrelating the features in the latent space. Through extensive empirical studies, we demonstrate that our framework effectively learns predictive representations without collapse, which significantly improves the sample efficiency of state-of-the-art URL methods on the Atari 100k benchmark.

H-Likelihood Approach to Deep Neural Networks with Temporal-Spatial Random Effects for High-Cardinality Categorical Features	Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are one of the most powerful tools for prediction, but many of them implicitly assume that the data are statistically independent. However, in the real world, it is common for large-scale data to be clustered with temporal-spatial correlation structures. Variational approaches and integrated likelihood approaches have been proposed to obtain approximate maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) for correlated data. However, due to the large size of data, they cannot provide exact MLEs. In this study, we propose a new hierarchical likelihood approach to DNNs with correlated random effects for clustered data. By jointly optimizing the the negative h-likelihood loss, we can provide exact MLEs for both mean and dispersion parameters, as well as the best linear unbiased predictors for the random effects. Moreover, the hierarchical likelihood allows a computable procedure for restricted maximum likelihood estimators of dispersion parameters. The proposed two-step algorithm enables online learning for the neural networks, whereas the integrated likelihood cannot decompose like a widely-used loss function in DNNs. The proposed h-likelihood approach offers several advantages, which we demonstrate through numerical studies and real data analyses.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lee23k	Hangbin Lee, Youngjo Lee
Minimizing Trajectory Curvature of ODE-based Generative Models	Recent ODE/SDE-based generative models, such as diffusion models, rectified flows, and flow matching, define a generative process as a time reversal of a fixed forward process. Even though these models show impressive performance on large-scale datasets, numerical simulation requires multiple evaluations of a neural network, leading to a slow sampling speed. We attribute the reason to the high curvature of the learned generative trajectories, as it is directly related to the truncation error of a numerical solver. Based on the relationship between the forward process and the curvature, here we present an efficient method of training the forward process to minimize the curvature of generative trajectories without any ODE/SDE simulation. Experiments show that our method achieves a lower curvature than previous models and, therefore, decreased sampling costs while maintaining competitive performance.

CoDi: Co-evolving Contrastive Diffusion Models for Mixed-type Tabular Synthesis	With growing attention to tabular data these days, the attempt to apply a synthetic table to various tasks has been expanded toward various scenarios. Owing to the recent advances in generative modeling, fake data generated by tabular data synthesis models become sophisticated and realistic. However, there still exists a difficulty in modeling discrete variables (columns) of tabular data. In this work, we propose to process continuous and discrete variables separately (but being conditioned on each other) by two diffusion models. The two diffusion models are co-evolved during training by reading conditions from each other. In order to further bind the diffusion models, moreover, we introduce a contrastive learning method with a negative sampling method. In our experiments with 11 real-world tabular datasets and 8 baseline methods, we prove the efficacy of the proposed method, called $\texttt{CoDi}$.

FlexRound: Learnable Rounding based on Element-wise Division for Post-Training Quantization	Post-training quantization (PTQ) has been gaining popularity for the deployment of deep neural networks on resource-limited devices since unlike quantization-aware training, neither a full training dataset nor end-to-end training is required at all. As PTQ schemes based on reconstructing each layer or block output turn out to be effective to enhance quantized model performance, recent works have developed algorithms to devise and learn a new weight-rounding scheme so as to better reconstruct each layer or block output. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective new weight-rounding mechanism for PTQ, coined FlexRound, based on element-wise division instead of typical element-wise addition such that FlexRound enables jointly learning a common quantization grid size as well as a different scale for each pre-trained weight. Thanks to the reciprocal rule of derivatives induced by element-wise division, FlexRound is inherently able to exploit pre-trained weights when updating their corresponding scales, and thus, flexibly quantize pre-trained weights depending on their magnitudes. We empirically validate the efficacy of FlexRound on a wide range of models and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to carry out comprehensive experiments on not only image classification and natural language understanding but also natural language generation, assuming a per-tensor uniform PTQ setting. Moreover, we demonstrate, for the first time, that large language models can be efficiently quantized, with only a negligible impact on performance compared to half-precision baselines, achieved by reconstructing the output in a block-by-block manner.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lee23h	Jung Hyun Lee, Jeonghoon Kim, Se Jung Kwon, Dongsoo Lee
Pix2Struct: Screenshot Parsing as Pretraining for Visual Language Understanding	Visually-situated language is ubiquitous—sources range from textbooks with diagrams to web pages with images and tables, to mobile apps with buttons and forms. Perhaps due to this diversity, previous work has typically relied on domain-specific recipes with limited sharing of the underlying data, model architectures, and objectives. We present Pix2Struct, a pretrained image-to-text model for purely visual language understanding, which can be finetuned on tasks containing visually-situated language. Pix2Struct is pretrained by learning to parse masked screenshots of web pages into simplified HTML. The web, with its richness of visual elements cleanly reflected in the HTML structure, provides a large source of pretraining data well suited to the diversity of downstream tasks. Intuitively, this objective subsumes common pretraining signals such as OCR, language modeling, and image captioning. In addition to the novel pretraining strategy, we introduce a variable-resolution input representation and a more flexible integration of language and vision inputs, where language prompts such as questions are rendered directly on top of the input image. For the first time, we show that a single pretrained model can achieve state-of-the-art results in six out of nine tasks across four domains: documents, illustrations, user interfaces, and natural images.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lee23g	Kenton Lee, Mandar Joshi, Iulia Raluca Turc, Hexiang Hu, Fangyu Liu, Julian Martin Eisenschlos, Urvashi Khandelwal, Peter Shaw, Ming-Wei Chang, Kristina Toutanova
Exploring Chemical Space with Score-based Out-of-distribution Generation	A well-known limitation of existing molecular generative models is that the generated molecules highly resemble those in the training set. To generate truly novel molecules that may have even better properties for de novo drug discovery, more powerful exploration in the chemical space is necessary. To this end, we propose Molecular Out-Of-distribution Diffusion(MOOD), a score-based diffusion scheme that incorporates out-of-distribution (OOD) control in the generative stochastic differential equation (SDE) with simple control of a hyperparameter, thus requires no additional costs. Since some novel molecules may not meet the basic requirements of real-world drugs, MOOD performs conditional generation by utilizing the gradients from a property predictor that guides the reverse-time diffusion process to high-scoring regions according to target properties such as protein-ligand interactions, drug-likeness, and synthesizability. This allows MOOD to search for novel and meaningful molecules rather than generating unseen yet trivial ones. We experimentally validate that MOOD is able to explore the chemical space beyond the training distribution, generating molecules that outscore ones found with existing methods, and even the top 0.01% of the original training pool. Our code is available at https://github.com/SeulLee05/MOOD.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lee23f	Seul Lee, Jaehyeong Jo, Sung Ju Hwang
Conditional Graph Information Bottleneck for Molecular Relational Learning	Molecular relational learning, whose goal is to learn the interaction behavior between molecular pairs, got a surge of interest in molecular sciences due to its wide range of applications. Recently, graph neural networks have recently shown great success in molecular relational learning by modeling a molecule as a graph structure, and considering atom-level interactions between two molecules. Despite their success, existing molecular relational learning methods tend to overlook the nature of chemistry, i.e., a chemical compound is composed of multiple substructures such as functional groups that cause distinctive chemical reactions. In this work, we propose a novel relational learning framework, called CGIB, that predicts the interaction behavior between a pair of graphs by detecting core subgraphs therein. The main idea is, given a pair of graphs, to find a subgraph from a graph that contains the minimal sufficient information regarding the task at hand conditioned on the paired graph based on the principle of conditional graph information bottleneck. We argue that our proposed method mimics the nature of chemical reactions, i.e., the core substructure of a molecule varies depending on which other molecule it interacts with. Extensive experiments on various tasks with real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of CGIB over state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/Namkyeong/CGIB.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lee23e	Namkyeong Lee, Dongmin Hyun, Gyoung S. Na, Sungwon Kim, Junseok Lee, Chanyoung Park
Optimality of Thompson Sampling with Noninformative Priors for Pareto Bandits	In the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem, a randomized probability matching policy called Thompson sampling (TS) has shown excellent performance in various reward models. In addition to the empirical performance, TS has been shown to achieve asymptotic problem-dependent lower bounds in several models. However, its optimality has been mainly addressed under light-tailed or one-parameter models that belong to exponential families. In this paper, we consider the optimality of TS for the Pareto model that has a heavy tail and is parameterized by two unknown parameters. Specifically, we discuss the optimality of TS with probability matching priors that include the Jeffreys prior and the reference priors. We first prove that TS with certain probability matching priors can achieve the optimal regret bound. Then, we show the suboptimality of TS with other priors, including the Jeffreys and the reference priors. Nevertheless, we find that TS with the Jeffreys and reference priors can achieve the asymptotic lower bound if one uses a truncation procedure. These results suggest carefully choosing noninformative priors to avoid suboptimality and show the effectiveness of truncation procedures in TS-based policies.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lee23d	Jongyeong Lee, Junya Honda, Chao-Kai Chiang, Masashi Sugiyama
InGram: Inductive Knowledge Graph Embedding via Relation Graphs	Inductive knowledge graph completion has been considered as the task of predicting missing triplets between new entities that are not observed during training. While most inductive knowledge graph completion methods assume that all entities can be new, they do not allow new relations to appear at inference time. This restriction prohibits the existing methods from appropriately handling real-world knowledge graphs where new entities accompany new relations. In this paper, we propose an INductive knowledge GRAph eMbedding method, InGram, that can generate embeddings of new relations as well as new entities at inference time. Given a knowledge graph, we define a relation graph as a weighted graph consisting of relations and the affinity weights between them. Based on the relation graph and the original knowledge graph, InGram learns how to aggregate neighboring embeddings to generate relation and entity embeddings using an attention mechanism. Experimental results show that InGram outperforms 14 different state-of-the-art methods on varied inductive learning scenarios.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lee23c	Jaejun Lee, Chanyoung Chung, Joyce Jiyoung Whang
Towards Deep Attention in Graph Neural Networks: Problems and Remedies	Graph neural networks (GNNs) learn the representation of graph-structured data, and their expressiveness can be further enhanced by inferring node relations for propagation. Attention-based GNNs infer neighbor importance to manipulate the weight of its propagation. Despite their popularity, the discussion on deep graph attention and its unique challenges has been limited. In this work, we investigate some problematic phenomena related to deep graph attention, including vulnerability to over-smoothed features and smooth cumulative attention. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that various attention-based GNNs suffer from these problems. Motivated by our findings, we propose AERO-GNN, a novel GNN architecture designed for deep graph attention. AERO-GNN provably mitigates the proposed problems of deep graph attention, which is further empirically demonstrated with (a) its adaptive and less smooth attention functions and (b) higher performance at deep layers (up to 64). On 9 out of 12 node classification benchmarks, AERO-GNN outperforms the baseline GNNs, highlighting the advantages of deep graph attention.

Learning in POMDPs is Sample-Efficient with Hindsight Observability	POMDPs capture a broad class of decision making problems, but hardness results suggest that learning is intractable even in simple settings due to the inherent partial observability. However, in many realistic problems, more information is either revealed or can be computed during some point of the learning process. Motivated by diverse applications ranging from robotics to data center scheduling, we formulate a Hindsight Observable Markov Decision Process (HOMDP) as a POMDP where the latent states are revealed to the learner in hindsight and only during training. We introduce new algorithms for the tabular and function approximation settings that are provably sample-efficient with hindsight observability, even in POMDPs that would otherwise be statistically intractable. We give a lower bound showing that the tabular algorithm is optimal in its dependence on latent state and observation cardinalities.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lee23a	Jonathan Lee, Alekh Agarwal, Christoph Dann, Tong Zhang
Strategic Classification with Unknown User Manipulations	In many human-centric applications for Machine Learning instances will adapt to a classifier after its deployment. The field of strategic classification deals with this issue by aiming for a classifier that balances the trade-off between correctness and robustness to manipulation. This task is made harder if the underlying manipulation structure (i.e. the set of manipulations available at every instance) is unknown to the learner. We propose a novel batch-learning setting in which we use unlabeled data from previous rounds to estimate the manipulation structure. We show that in this batch-learning setting it is possible to learn a close-to-optimal classifier in terms of the strategic loss even without knowing the feasible manipulations beforehand. In line with recent advances in the strategic classification literature, we do not assume a best-response from agents but only require that observed manipulations are feasible.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lechner23a	Tosca Lechner, Ruth Urner, Shai Ben-David
Bootstrapped Representations in Reinforcement Learning	In reinforcement learning (RL), state representations are key to dealing with large or continuous state spaces. While one of the promises of deep learning algorithms is to automatically construct features well-tuned for the task they try to solve, such a representation might not emerge from end-to-end training of deep RL agents. To mitigate this issue, auxiliary objectives are often incorporated into the learning process and help shape the learnt state representation. Bootstrapping methods are today's method of choice to make these additional predictions. Yet, it is unclear which features these algorithms capture and how they relate to those from other auxiliary-task-based approaches. In this paper, we address this gap and provide a theoretical characterization of the state representation learnt by temporal difference learning (Sutton, 1988). Surprisingly, we find that this representation differs from the features learned by Monte Carlo and residual gradient algorithms for most transition structures of the environment in the policy evaluation setting. We describe the efficacy of these representations for policy evaluation, and use our theoretical analysis to design new auxiliary learning rules. We complement our theoretical results with an empirical comparison of these learning rules for different cumulant functions on classic domains such as the four-room domain (Sutton et al, 1999) and Mountain Car (Moore, 1990).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/le-lan23a	Charline Le Lan, Stephen Tu, Mark Rowland, Anna Harutyunyan, Rishabh Agarwal, Marc G Bellemare, Will Dabney
Pre-training for Speech Translation: CTC Meets Optimal Transport	The gap between speech and text modalities is a major challenge in speech-to-text translation (ST). Different methods have been proposed to reduce this gap, but most of them require architectural changes in ST training. In this work, we propose to mitigate this issue at the pre-training stage, requiring no change in the ST model. First, we show that the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss can reduce the modality gap by design. We provide a quantitative comparison with the more common cross-entropy loss, showing that pre-training with CTC consistently achieves better final ST accuracy. Nevertheless, CTC is only a partial solution and thus, in our second contribution, we propose a novel pre-training method combining CTC and optimal transport to further reduce this gap. Our method pre-trains a Siamese-like model composed of two encoders, one for acoustic inputs and the other for textual inputs, such that they produce representations that are close to each other in the Wasserstein space. Extensive experiments on the standard CoVoST-2 and MuST-C datasets show that our pre-training method applied to the vanilla encoder-decoder Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance under the no-external-data setting, and performs on par with recent strong multi-task learning systems trained with external data. Finally, our method can also be applied on top of these multi-task systems, leading to further improvements for these models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/le23a	Phuong-Hang Le, Hongyu Gong, Changhan Wang, Juan Pino, Benjamin Lecouteux, Didier Schwab
Cluster Explanation via Polyhedral Descriptions	This paper focuses on the cluster description problem where, given a dataset and its partition into clusters, the task is to explain the clusters. We introduce a new approach to explain clusters by constructing a polyhedron around each cluster while minimizing either the complexity of the resulting polyhedra or the number of features used in the description. We formulate the cluster description problem as an integer program and present a column generation approach to search over an exponential number of candidate half-spaces that can be used to build the polyhedra. To deal with large datasets, we introduce a novel grouping scheme that first forms smaller groups of data points and then builds the polyhedra around the grouped data, a strategy which out-performs the common approach of sub-sampling data. Compared to state of the art cluster description algorithms, our approach is able to achieve competitive interpretability with improved description accuracy.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lawless23a	Connor Lawless, Oktay Gunluk
Target-based Surrogates for Stochastic Optimization	We consider minimizing functions for which it is expensive to compute the (possibly stochastic) gradient.

Who Needs to Know? Minimal Knowledge for Optimal Coordination	To optimally coordinate with others in cooperative games, it is often crucial to have information about one's collaborators: successful driving requires understanding which side of the road to drive on. However, not every feature of collaborators is strategically relevant: the fine-grained acceleration of drivers may be ignored while maintaining optimal coordination. We show that there is a well-defined dichotomy between strategically relevant and irrelevant information. Moreover, we show that, in dynamic games, this dichotomy has a compact representation that can be efficiently computed via a Bellman backup operator. We apply this algorithm to analyze the strategically relevant information for tasks in both a standard and a partially observable version of the Overcooked environment. Theoretical and empirical results show that our algorithms are significantly more efficient than baselines.

Speeding Up Bellman Ford via Minimum Violation Permutations	The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a basic primitive for computing single source shortest paths in graphs with negative weight edges. Its running time is governed by the order the algorithm examines vertices for iterative updates on the value of their shortest path. In this work we study this problem through the lens of 'Algorithms with predictions,' and show how to leverage auxiliary information from similar instances to improve the running time. We do this by identifying the key problem of Minimum Violation Permutations, and give algorithms with strong approximation guarantees as well as formal lower bounds. We complement the theoretical analysis with an empirical evaluation, showing that this approach can lead to a significant speed up in practice.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lattanzi23a	Silvio Lattanzi, Ola Svensson, Sergei Vassilvitskii
Minimalistic Predictions to Schedule Jobs with Online Precedence Constraints	We consider non-clairvoyant scheduling with online precedence constraints, where an algorithm is oblivious to any job dependencies and learns about a job only if all of its predecessors have been completed. Given strong impossibility results in classical competitive analysis, we investigate the problem in a learning-augmented setting, where an algorithm has access to predictions without any quality guarantee. We discuss different prediction models: novel problem-specific models as well as general ones, which have been proposed in previous works. We present lower bounds and algorithmic upper bounds for different precedence topologies, and thereby give a structured overview on which and how additional (possibly erroneous) information helps for designing better algorithms. Along the way, we also improve bounds on traditional competitive ratios for existing algorithms.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lassota23a	Alexandra Anna Lassota, Alexander Lindermayr, Nicole Megow, Jens Schlöter
On the Occupancy Measure of Non-Markovian Policies in Continuous MDPs	The state-action occupancy measure of a policy is the expected (discounted or undiscounted) number of times a state-action couple is visited in a trajectory. For decades, RL books have been reporting the occupancy equivalence between Markovian and non-Markovian policies in countable state-action spaces under mild conditions. This equivalence states that the occupancy of any non-Markovian policy can be equivalently obtained by a Markovian policy, i.e. a memoryless probability distribution, conditioned only on its current state. While expected, for technical reasons, the translation of this result to continuous state space has resisted until now. Our main contribution is to fill this gap and to provide a general measure-theoretic treatment of the problem, permitting, in particular, its extension to continuous MDPs. Furthermore, we show that when the occupancy is infinite, we may encounter some non-trivial cases where the result does not hold anymore.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/laroche23a	Romain Laroche, Remi Tachet Des Combes
Lottery Tickets in Evolutionary Optimization: On Sparse Backpropagation-Free Trainability	Is the lottery ticket phenomenon an idiosyncrasy of gradient-based training or does it generalize to evolutionary optimization? In this paper we establish the existence of highly sparse trainable initializations for evolution strategies (ES) and characterize qualitative differences compared to gradient descent (GD)-based sparse training. We introduce a novel signal-to-noise iterative pruning procedure, which incorporates loss curvature information into the network pruning step. This can enable the discovery of even sparser trainable network initializations when using black-box evolution as compared to GD-based optimization. Furthermore, we find that these initializations encode an inductive bias, which transfers across different ES, related tasks and even to GD-based training. Finally, we compare the local optima resulting from the different optimization paradigms and sparsity levels. In contrast to GD, ES explore diverse and flat local optima and do not preserve linear mode connectivity across sparsity levels and independent runs. The results highlight qualitative differences between evolution and gradient-based learning dynamics, which can be uncovered by the study of iterative pruning procedures.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lange23a	Robert Tjarko Lange, Henning Sprekeler

Metagenomic Binning using Connectivity-constrained Variational Autoencoders	Current state-of-the-art techniques for metagenomic binning only utilize local features for the individual DNA sequences (contigs), neglecting additional information such as the assembly graph, in which the contigs are connected according to overlapping reads, and gene markers identified in the contigs. In this paper, we propose the use of a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) tailored to leverage auxiliary structural information about contig relations when learning contig representations for subsequent metagenomic binning. Our method, CCVAE, improves on previous work that used VAEs for learning latent representations of the individual contigs, by constraining these representations according to the connectivity information from the assembly graph. Additionally, we incorporate into the model additional information in the form of marker genes to better differentiate contigs from different genomes. Our experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that CCVAE outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, thus providing a more effective method for metagenomic binning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lamurias23a	Andre Lamurias, Alessandro Tibo, Katja Hose, Mads Albertsen, Thomas Dyhre Nielsen

Bootstrap in High Dimension with Low Computation	"The bootstrap is a popular data-driven method to quantify statistical uncertainty, but for modern high-dimensional problems, it could suffer from huge computational costs due to the need to repeatedly generate resamples and refit models. We study the use of bootstraps in high-dimensional environments with a small number of resamples. In particular, we show that with a recent ""cheap"" bootstrap perspective, using a number of resamples as small as one could attain valid coverage even when the dimension grows closely with the sample size, thus strongly supporting the implementability of the bootstrap for large-scale problems. We validate our theoretical results and compare the performance of our approach with other benchmarks via a range of experiments."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lam23a	Henry Lam, Zhenyuan Liu
Private Statistical Estimation of Many Quantiles	This work studies the estimation of many statistical quantiles under differential privacy. More precisely, given a distribution and access to i.i.d. samples from it, we study the estimation of the inverse of its cumulative distribution function (the quantile function) at specific points. For instance, this task is of key importance in private data generation. We present two different approaches. The first one consists in privately estimating the empirical quantiles of the samples and using this result as an estimator of the quantiles of the distribution. In particular, we study the statistical properties of the recently published algorithm introduced by (Kaplan et al., 2022) that privately estimates the quantiles recursively. The second approach is to use techniques of density estimation in order to uniformly estimate the quantile function on an interval. In particular, we show that there is a tradeoff between the two methods. When we want to estimate many quantiles, it is better to estimate the density rather than estimating the quantile function at specific points.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lalanne23a	Clément Lalanne, Aurélien Garivier, Rémi Gribonval
FP-Diffusion: Improving Score-based Diffusion Models by Enforcing the Underlying Score Fokker-Planck Equation	Score-based generative models (SGMs) learn a family of noise-conditional score functions corresponding to the data density perturbed with increasingly large amounts of noise. These perturbed data densities are linked together by the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE), a partial differential equation (PDE) governing the spatial-temporal evolution of a density undergoing a diffusion process. In this work, we derive a corresponding equation called the score FPE that characterizes the noise-conditional scores of the perturbed data densities (i.e., their gradients). Surprisingly, despite the impressive empirical performance, we observe that scores learned through denoising score matching (DSM) fail to fulfill the underlying score FPE, which is an inherent self-consistency property of the ground truth score. We prove that satisfying the score FPE is desirable as it improves the likelihood and the degree of conservativity. Hence, we propose to regularize the DSM objective to enforce satisfaction of the score FPE, and we show the effectiveness of this approach across various datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lai23d	Chieh-Hsin Lai, Yuhta Takida, Naoki Murata, Toshimitsu Uesaka, Yuki Mitsufuji, Stefano Ermon
ChiPFormer: Transferable Chip Placement via Offline Decision Transformer	Placement is a critical step in modern chip design, aiming to determine the positions of circuit modules on the chip canvas. Recent works have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can improve human performance in chip placement. However, such an RL-based approach suffers from long training time and low transfer ability in unseen chip circuits. To resolve these challenges, we cast the chip placement as an offline RL formulation and present ChiPFormer that enables learning a transferable placement policy from fixed offline data. ChiPFormer has several advantages that prior arts do not have. First, ChiPFormer can exploit offline placement designs to learn transferable policies more efficiently in a multi-task setting. Second, ChiPFormer can promote effective finetuning for unseen chip circuits, reducing the placement runtime from hours to minutes. Third, extensive experiments on 32 chip circuits demonstrate that ChiPFormer achieves significantly better placement quality while reducing the runtime by 10x compared to recent state-of-the-art approaches in both public benchmarks and realistic industrial tasks.

DS-1000: A Natural and Reliable Benchmark for Data Science Code Generation	We introduce DS-1000, a code generation benchmark with a thousand data science problems spanning seven Python libraries, such as Numpy and Pandas. Compared to prior works, DS-1000 incorporates three core features. First, our problems reflect diverse, realistic, and practical use cases since we collected them from StackOverflow. Second, our automatic evaluation is highly specific (reliable) – across all Codex-002-predicted solutions that our evaluation accepts, only 1.8% of them are incorrect; we achieve this with multi-criteria metrics, checking both functional correctness by running test cases and surface-form constraints by restricting API usages or keywords. Finally, we proactively defend against memorization by slightly modifying our problems to be different from the original StackOverflow source; consequently, models cannot answer them correctly by memorizing the solutions from pre-training. The current best public system (Codex-002) achieves 43.3% accuracy, leaving ample room for improvement. We release our benchmark at https://ds1000-code-gen.github.io.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lai23b	Yuhang Lai, Chengxi Li, Yiming Wang, Tianyi Zhang, Ruiqi Zhong, Luke Zettlemoyer, Wen-Tau Yih, Daniel Fried, Sida Wang, Tao Yu
Automatically marginalized MCMC in probabilistic programming	Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a powerful algorithm to sample latent variables from Bayesian models. The advent of probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) frees users from writing inference algorithms and lets users focus on modeling. However, many models are difficult for HMC to solve directly, and often require tricks like model reparameterization. We are motivated by the fact that many of those models could be simplified by marginalization. We propose to use automatic marginalization as part of the sampling process using HMC in a graphical model extracted from a PPL, which substantially improves sampling from real-world hierarchical models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lai23a	Jinlin Lai, Javier Burroni, Hui Guan, Daniel Sheldon
A theory of continuous generative flow networks	Generative flow networks (GFlowNets) are amortized variational inference algorithms that are trained to sample from unnormalized target distributions over compositional objects. A key limitation of GFlowNets until this time has been that they are restricted to discrete spaces. We present a theory for generalized GFlowNets, which encompasses both existing discrete GFlowNets and ones with continuous or hybrid state spaces, and perform experiments with two goals in mind. First, we illustrate critical points of the theory and the importance of various assumptions. Second, we empirically demonstrate how observations about discrete GFlowNets transfer to the continuous case and show strong results compared to non-GFlowNet baselines on several previously studied tasks. This work greatly widens the perspectives for the application of GFlowNets in probabilistic inference and various modeling settings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lahlou23a	Salem Lahlou, Tristan Deleu, Pablo Lemos, Dinghuai Zhang, Alexandra Volokhova, Alex Hernández-Garcı́a, Lena Nehale Ezzine, Yoshua Bengio, Nikolay Malkin
Hybrid Energy Based Model in the Feature Space for Out-of-Distribution Detection	Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical requirement for the deployment of deep neural networks. This paper introduces the HEAT model, a new post-hoc OOD detection method estimating the density of in-distribution (ID) samples using hybrid energy-based models (EBM) in the feature space of a pre-trained backbone. HEAT complements prior density estimators of the ID density, e.g. parametric models like the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), to provide an accurate yet robust density estimation. A second contribution is to leverage the EBM framework to provide a unified density estimation and to compose several energy terms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significance of the two contributions. HEAT sets new state-of-the-art OOD detection results on the CIFAR-10 / CIFAR-100 benchmark as well as on the large-scale Imagenet benchmark.

Nearly-Optimal Hierarchical Clustering for Well-Clustered Graphs	This paper presents two efficient hierarchical clustering (HC) algorithms with respect to Dasgupta's cost function. For any input graph $G$ with a clear cluster-structure, our designed algorithms run in nearly-linear time in the input size of $G$, and return an $O(1)$-approximate HC tree with respect to Dasgupta's cost function. We compare the performance of our algorithm against the previous state-of-the-art on synthetic and real-world datasets and show that our designed algorithm produces comparable or better HC trees with much lower running time.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/laenen23a	Steinar Laenen, Bogdan Adrian Manghiuc, He Sun
Synergies between Disentanglement and Sparsity: Generalization and Identifiability in Multi-Task Learning	Although disentangled representations are often said to be beneficial for downstream tasks, current empirical and theoretical understanding is limited. In this work, we provide evidence that disentangled representations coupled with sparse task-specific predictors improve generalization. In the context of multi-task learning, we prove a new identifiability result that provides conditions under which maximally sparse predictors yield disentangled representations. Motivated by this theoretical result, we propose a practical approach to learn disentangled representations based on a sparsity-promoting bi-level optimization problem. Finally, we explore a meta-learning version of this algorithm based on group Lasso multiclass SVM predictors, for which we derive a tractable dual formulation. It obtains competitive results on standard few-shot classification benchmarks, while each task is using only a fraction of the learned representations.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/lachapelle23a	Sebastien Lachapelle, Tristan Deleu, Divyat Mahajan, Ioannis Mitliagkas, Yoshua Bengio, Simon Lacoste-Julien, Quentin Bertrand
Emergence of Adaptive Circadian Rhythms in Deep Reinforcement Learning	Adapting to regularities of the environment is critical for biological organisms to anticipate events and plan. A prominent example is the circadian rhythm corresponding to the internalization by organisms of the $24$-hour period of the Earth's rotation. In this work, we study the emergence of circadian-like rhythms in deep reinforcement learning agents. In particular, we deployed agents in an environment with a reliable periodic variation while solving a foraging task. We systematically characterize the agent's behavior during learning and demonstrate the emergence of a rhythm that is endogenous and entrainable. Interestingly, the internal rhythm adapts to shifts in the phase of the environmental signal without any re-training. Furthermore, we show via bifurcation and phase response curve analyses how artificial neurons develop dynamics to support the internalization of the environmental rhythm. From a dynamical systems view, we demonstrate that the adaptation proceeds by the emergence of a stable periodic orbit in the neuron dynamics with a phase response that allows an optimal phase synchronisation between the agent's dynamics and the environmental rhythm.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/labash23a	Aqeel Labash, Florian Stelzer, Daniel Majoral, Raul Vicente Zafra
Data-OOB: Out-of-bag Estimate as a Simple and Efficient Data Value	Data valuation is a powerful framework for providing statistical insights into which data are beneficial or detrimental to model training. Many Shapley-based data valuation methods have shown promising results in various downstream tasks, however, they are well known to be computationally challenging as it requires training a large number of models. As a result, it has been recognized as infeasible to apply to large datasets. To address this issue, we propose Data-OOB, a new data valuation method for a bagging model that utilizes the out-of-bag estimate. The proposed method is computationally efficient and can scale to millions of data by reusing trained weak learners. Specifically, Data-OOB takes less than $2.25$ hours on a single CPU processor when there are $10^6$ samples to evaluate and the input dimension is $100$. Furthermore, Data-OOB has solid theoretical interpretations in that it identifies the same important data point as the infinitesimal jackknife influence function when two different points are compared. We conduct comprehensive experiments using 12 classification datasets, each with thousands of sample sizes. We demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art data valuation methods in identifying mislabeled data and finding a set of helpful (or harmful) data points, highlighting the potential for applying data values in real-world applications.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kwon23e	Yongchan Kwon, James Zou
Complexity of Block Coordinate Descent with Proximal Regularization and Applications to Wasserstein CP-dictionary Learning	We consider the block coordinate descent methods of Gauss-Seidel type with proximal regularization (BCD-PR), which is a classical method of minimizing general nonconvex objectives under constraints that has a wide range of practical applications. We theoretically establish the worst-case complexity bound for this algorithm. Namely, we show that for general nonconvex smooth objectives with block-wise constraints, the classical BCD-PR algorithm converges to an epsilon-stationary point within O(1/epsilon) iterations. Under a mild condition, this result still holds even if the algorithm is executed inexactly in each step. As an application, we propose a provable and efficient algorithm for 'Wasserstein CP-dictionary learning', which seeks a set of elementary probability distributions that can well-approximate a given set of d-dimensional joint probability distributions. Our algorithm is a version of BCD-PR that operates in the dual space, where the primal problem is regularized both entropically and proximally.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kwon23d	Dohyun Kwon, Hanbaek Lyu
A Fully First-Order Method for Stochastic Bilevel Optimization	We consider stochastic unconstrained bilevel optimization problems when only the first-order gradient oracles are available. While numerous optimization methods have been proposed for tackling bilevel problems, existing methods either tend to require possibly expensive calculations regarding Hessians of lower-level objectives, or lack rigorous finite-time performance guarantees. In this work, we propose a Fully First-order Stochastic Approximation (F2SA) method, and study its non-asymptotic convergence properties. Specifically, we show that F2SA converges to an $\epsilon$-stationary solution of the bilevel problem after $\epsilon^{-7/2}, \epsilon^{-5/2}$, and $\epsilon^{-3/2}$ iterations (each iteration using $O(1)$ samples) when stochastic noises are in both level objectives, only in the upper-level objective, and not present (deterministic settings), respectively. We further show that if we employ momentum-assisted gradient estimators, the iteration complexities can be improved to $\epsilon^{-5/2}, \epsilon^{-4/2}$, and $\epsilon^{-3/2}$, respectively. We demonstrate even superior practical performance of the proposed method over existing second-order based approaches on MNIST data-hypercleaning experiments.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kwon23c	Jeongyeol Kwon, Dohyun Kwon, Stephen Wright, Robert D Nowak
Reward-Mixing MDPs with Few Latent Contexts are Learnable	We consider episodic reinforcement learning in reward-mixing Markov decision processes (RMMDPs): at the beginning of every episode nature randomly picks a latent reward model among $M$ candidates and an agent interacts with the MDP throughout the episode for $H$ time steps. Our goal is to learn a near-optimal policy that nearly maximizes the $H$ time-step cumulative rewards in such a model. Prior work established an upper bound for RMMDPs with $M=2$. In this work, we resolve several open questions for the general RMMDP setting. We consider an arbitrary $M\ge2$ and provide a sample-efficient algorithm–$EM^2$–that outputs an $\epsilon$-optimal policy using $O \left(\epsilon^{-2} \cdot S^d A^d \cdot \text{poly}(H, Z)^d \right)$ episodes, where $S, A$ are the number of states and actions respectively, $H$ is the time-horizon, $Z$ is the support size of reward distributions and $d=O(\min(M,H))$. We also provide a $(SA)^{\Omega(\sqrt{M})} / \epsilon^{2}$ lower bound, supporting that super-polynomial sample complexity in $M$ is necessary.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kwon23b	Jeongyeol Kwon, Yonathan Efroni, Constantine Caramanis, Shie Mannor
Rotation and Translation Invariant Representation Learning with Implicit Neural Representations	In many computer vision applications, images are acquired with arbitrary or random rotations and translations, and in such setups, it is desirable to obtain semantic representations disentangled from the image orientation. Examples of such applications include semiconductor wafer defect inspection, plankton microscope images, and inference on single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) micro-graphs. In this work, we propose Invariant Representation Learning with Implicit Neural Representation (IRL-INR), which uses an implicit neural representation (INR) with a hypernetwork to obtain semantic representations disentangled from the orientation of the image. We show that IRL-INR can effectively learn disentangled semantic representations on more complex images compared to those considered in prior works and show that these semantic representations synergize well with SCAN to produce state-of-the-art unsupervised clustering results.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kwon23a	Sehyun Kwon, Joo Young Choi, Ernest K.

GeCoNeRF: Few-shot Neural Radiance Fields via Geometric Consistency	We present a novel framework to regularize Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) in a few-shot setting with a geometry-aware consistency regularization. The proposed approach leverages a rendered depth map at unobserved viewpoint to warp sparse input images to the unobserved viewpoint and impose them as pseudo ground truths to facilitate learning of NeRF. By encouraging such geometry-aware consistency at a feature-level instead of using pixel-level reconstruction loss, we regularize the NeRF at semantic and structural levels while allowing for modeling view dependent radiance to account for color variations across viewpoints. We also propose an effective method to filter out erroneous warped solutions, along with training strategies to stabilize training during optimization. We show that our model achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art few-shot NeRF models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kwak23a	Min-Seop Kwak, Jiuhn Song, Seungryong Kim
Cooperation in the Latent Space: The Benefits of Adding Mixture Components in Variational Autoencoders	In this paper, we show how the mixture components cooperate when they jointly adapt to maximize the ELBO. We build upon recent advances in the multiple and adaptive importance sampling literature. We then model the mixture components using separate encoder networks and show empirically that the ELBO is monotonically non-decreasing as a function of the number of mixture components. These results hold for a range of different VAE architectures on the MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. In this work, we also demonstrate that increasing the number of mixture components improves the latent-representation capabilities of the VAE on both image and single-cell datasets. This cooperative behavior motivates that using Mixture VAEs should be considered a standard approach for obtaining more flexible variational approximations. Finally, Mixture VAEs are here, for the first time, compared and combined with normalizing flows, hierarchical models and/or the VampPrior in an extensive ablation study. Multiple of our Mixture VAEs achieve state-of-the-art log-likelihood results for VAE architectures on the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets.

Tied-Augment: Controlling Representation Similarity Improves Data Augmentation	Data augmentation methods have played an important role in the recent advance of deep learning models, and have become an indispensable component of state-of-the-art models in semi-supervised, self-supervised, and supervised training for vision. Despite incurring no additional latency at test time, data augmentation often requires more epochs of training to be effective. For example, even the simple flips-and-crops augmentation requires training for more than 5 epochs to improve performance, whereas RandAugment requires more than 90 epochs. We propose a general framework called Tied-Augment, which improves the efficacy of data augmentation in a wide range of applications by adding a simple term to the loss that can control the similarity of representations under distortions. Tied-Augment can improve state-of-the-art methods from data augmentation (e.g. RandAugment, mixup), optimization (e.g. SAM), and semi-supervised learning (e.g. FixMatch). For example, Tied-RandAugment can outperform RandAugment by 2.0% on ImageNet. Notably, using Tied-Augment, data augmentation can be made to improve generalization even when training for a few epochs and when fine-tuning. We open source our code at https://github.com/ekurtulus/tied-augment/tree/main.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kurtulus23a	Emirhan Kurtuluş, Zichao Li, Yann Dauphin, Ekin Dogus Cubuk
Modeling Dynamic Environments with Scene Graph Memory	Embodied AI agents that search for objects in large environments such as households often need to make efficient decisions by predicting object locations based on partial information. We pose this as a new type of link prediction problem: link prediction on partially observable dynamic graphs Our graph is a representation of a scene in which rooms and objects are nodes, and their relationships are encoded in the edges; only parts of the changing graph are known to the agent at each timestep. This partial observability poses a challenge to existing link prediction approaches, which we address. We propose a novel state representation – Scene Graph Memory (SGM) – with captures the agent's accumulated set of observations, as well as a neural net architecture called a Node Edge Predictor (NEP) that extracts information from the SGM to search efficiently. We evaluate our method in the Dynamic House Simulator, a new benchmark that creates diverse dynamic graphs following the semantic patterns typically seen at homes, and show that NEP can be trained to predict the locations of objects in a variety of environments with diverse object movement dynamics, outperforming baselines both in terms of new scene adaptability and overall accuracy.

Featured Graph Coarsening with Similarity Guarantees	Graph coarsening is a dimensionality reduction technique that aims to learn a smaller-tractable graph while preserving the properties of the original input graph. However, many real-world graphs also have features or contexts associated with each node. The existing graph coarsening methods do not consider the node features and rely solely on a graph matrix(e.g., adjacency and Laplacian) to coarsen graphs. However, some recent deep learning-based graph coarsening methods are designed for specific tasks considering both node features and graph matrix. In this paper, we introduce a novel optimization-based framework for graph coarsening that takes both the graph matrix and the node features as the input and jointly learns the coarsened graph matrix and the coarsened feature matrix while ensuring desired properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that guarantees that the learned coarsened graph is $\epsilon\in[0,1)$ similar to the original graph. Extensive experiments with both real and synthetic benchmark datasets elucidate the proposed framework's efficacy and applicability for numerous graph-based applications, including graph clustering, node classification, stochastic block model identification, and graph summarization.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kumar23a	Manoj Kumar, Anurag Sharma, Shashwat Saxena, Sandeep Kumar
Towards Explaining Distribution Shifts	A distribution shift can have fundamental consequences such as signaling a change in the operating environment or significantly reducing the accuracy of downstream models. Thus, understanding distribution shifts is critical for examining and hopefully mitigating the effect of such a shift. Most prior work has focused on merely detecting if a shift has occurred and assumes any detected shift can be understood and handled appropriately by a human operator. We hope to aid in these manual mitigation tasks by explaining the distribution shift using interpretable transportation maps from the original distribution to the shifted one. We derive our interpretable mappings from a relaxation of the optimal transport problem, where the candidate mappings are restricted to a set of interpretable mappings. We then use a wide array of quintessential examples of distribution shift in real-world tabular, text, and image cases to showcase how our explanatory mappings provide a better balance between detail and interpretability than baseline explanations by both visual inspection and our PercentExplained metric.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kulinski23a	Sean Kulinski, David I.

SinDDM: A Single Image Denoising Diffusion Model	Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) have led to staggering performance leaps in image generation, editing and restoration. However, existing DDMs use very large datasets for training. Here, we introduce a framework for training a DDM on a single image. Our method, which we coin SinDDM, learns the internal statistics of the training image by using a multi-scale diffusion process. To drive the reverse diffusion process, we use a fully-convolutional light-weight denoiser, which is conditioned on both the noise level and the scale. This architecture allows generating samples of arbitrary dimensions, in a coarse-to-fine manner. As we illustrate, SinDDM generates diverse high-quality samples, and is applicable in a wide array of tasks, including style transfer and harmonization. Furthermore, it can be easily guided by external supervision. Particularly, we demonstrate text-guided generation from a single image using a pre-trained CLIP model.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kulikov23a	Vladimir Kulikov, Shahar Yadin, Matan Kleiner, Tomer Michaeli
Hierarchical Imitation Learning with Vector Quantized Models	The ability to plan actions on multiple levels of abstraction enables intelligent agents to solve complex tasks effectively. However, learning the models for both low and high-level planning from demonstrations has proven challenging, especially with higher-dimensional inputs. To address this issue, we propose to use reinforcement learning to identify subgoals in expert trajectories by associating the magnitude of the rewards with the predictability of low-level actions given the state and the chosen subgoal. We build a vector-quantized generative model for the identified subgoals to perform subgoal-level planning. In experiments, the algorithm excels at solving complex, long-horizon decision-making problems outperforming state-of-the-art. Because of its ability to plan, our algorithm can find better trajectories than the ones in the training set.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kujanpaa23a	Kalle Kujanpää, Joni Pajarinen, Alexander Ilin
Variance Control for Distributional Reinforcement Learning	Although distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely examined in the past few years, very few studies investigate the validity of the obtained Q-function estimator in the distributional setting. To fully understand how the approximation errors of the Q-function affect the whole training process, we do some error analysis and theoretically show how to reduce both the bias and the variance of the error terms. With this new understanding, we construct a new estimator Quantiled Expansion Mean (QEM) and introduce a new DRL algorithm (QEMRL) from the statistical perspective. We extensively evaluate our QEMRL algorithm on a variety of Atari and Mujoco benchmark tasks and demonstrate that QEMRL achieves significant improvement over baseline algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and convergence performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kuang23a	Qi Kuang, Zhoufan Zhu, Liwen Zhang, Fan Zhou
Learning to Design Analog Circuits to Meet Threshold Specifications	Automated design of analog and radio-frequency circuits using supervised or reinforcement learning from simulation data has recently been studied as an alternative to manual expert design. It is straightforward for a design agent to learn an inverse function from desired performance metrics to circuit parameters. However, it is more common for a user to have threshold performance criteria rather than an exact target vector of feasible performance measures. In this work, we propose a method for generating from simulation data a dataset on which a system can be trained via supervised learning to design circuits to meet threshold specifications. We moreover perform the to-date most extensive evaluation of automated analog circuit design, including experimenting in a significantly more diverse set of circuits than in prior work, covering linear, nonlinear, and autonomous circuit configurations, and show that our method consistently reaches success rate better than 90% at 5% error margin, while also improving data efficiency by upward of an order of magnitude.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/krylov23a	Dmitrii Krylov, Pooya Khajeh, Junhan Ouyang, Thomas Reeves, Tongkai Liu, Hiba Ajmal, Hamidreza Aghasi, Roy Fox
Diffusion Models for Black-Box Optimization	The goal of offline black-box optimization (BBO) is to optimize an expensive black-box function using a fixed dataset of function evaluations. Prior works consider forward approaches that learn surrogates to the black-box function and inverse approaches that directly map function values to corresponding points in the input domain of the black-box function. These approaches are limited by the quality of the offline dataset and the difficulty in learning one-to-many mappings in high dimensions, respectively. We propose Denoising Diffusion Optimization Models (DDOM), a new inverse approach for offline black-box optimization based on diffusion models. Given an offline dataset, DDOM learns a conditional generative model over the domain of the black-box function conditioned on the function values. We investigate several design choices in DDOM, such as reweighting the dataset to focus on high function values and the use of classifier-free guidance at test-time to enable generalization to function values that can even exceed the dataset maxima. Empirically, we conduct experiments on the Design-Bench benchmark (Trabucco et al., 2022) and show that DDOM achieves results competitive with state-of-the-art baselines.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/krishnamoorthy23a	Siddarth Krishnamoorthy, Satvik Mehul Mashkaria, Aditya Grover
Graph Neural Tangent Kernel: Convergence on Large Graphs	Graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve remarkable performance in graph machine learning tasks but can be hard to train on large-graph data, where their learning dynamics are not well understood. We investigate the training dynamics of large-graph GNNs using graph neural tangent kernels (GNTKs) and graphons. In the limit of large width, optimization of an overparametrized NN is equivalent to kernel regression on the NTK. Here, we investigate how the GNTK evolves as another independent dimension is varied: the graph size. We use graphons to define limit objects—graphon NNs for GNNs, and graphon NTKs for GNTKs—, and prove that, on a sequence of graphs, the GNTKs converge to the graphon NTK. We further prove that the spectrum of the GNTK, which is related to the problem's learning directions, converges to the spectrum of the GNTK. This implies that in the large-graph limit, the GNTK fitted on a graph of moderate size can be used to solve the same task on the large graph, and to infer the learning dynamics of the large-graph GNN. These results are verified empirically on node regression and classification tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/krishnagopal23a	Sanjukta Krishnagopal, Luana Ruiz
Towards Bridging the Gaps between the Right to Explanation and the Right to be Forgotten	The Right to Explanation and the Right to be Forgotten are two important principles outlined to regulate algorithmic decision making and data usage in real-world applications. While the right to explanation allows individuals to request an actionable explanation for an algorithmic decision, the right to be forgotten grants them the right to ask for their data to be deleted from all the databases and models of an organization. Intuitively, enforcing the right to be forgotten may trigger model updates which in turn invalidate previously provided explanations, thus violating the right to explanation. In this work, we investigate the technical implications arising due to the interference between the two aforementioned regulatory principles, and propose the first algorithmic framework to resolve the tension between them. To this end, we formulate a novel optimization problem to generate explanations that are robust to model updates due to the removal of training data instances by data deletion requests. We then derive an efficient approximation algorithm to handle the combinatorial complexity of this optimization problem. We theoretically demonstrate that our method generates explanations that are provably robust to worst-case data deletion requests with bounded costs in case of linear models and certain classes of non-linear models. Extensive experimentation with real-world datasets demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed framework.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/krishna23a	Satyapriya Krishna, Jiaqi Ma, Himabindu Lakkaraju
Multi-Task Differential Privacy Under Distribution Skew	We study the problem of multi-task learning under user-level differential privacy, in which n users contribute data to m tasks, each involving a subset of users. One important aspect of the problem, that can significantly impact quality, is the distribution skew among tasks. Tasks that have much fewer data samples than others are more susceptible to the noise added for privacy. It is natural to ask whether algorithms can adapt to this skew to improve the overall utility. We give a systematic analysis of the problem, by studying how to optimally allocate a user's privacy budget among tasks. We propose a generic algorithm, based on an adaptive reweighting of the empirical loss, and show that in the presence of distribution skew, this gives a quantifiable improvement of excess empirical risk. Experimental studies on recommendation problems that exhibit a long tail of small tasks, demonstrate that our methods significantly improve utility, achieving the state of the art on two standard benchmarks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/krichene23a	Walid Krichene, Prateek Jain, Shuang Song, Mukund Sundararajan, Abhradeep Guha Thakurta, Li Zhang
Estimation Beyond Data Reweighting: Kernel Method of Moments	Moment restrictions and their conditional counterparts emerge in many areas of machine learning and statistics ranging from causal inference to reinforcement learning. Estimators for these tasks, generally called methods of moments, include the prominent generalized method of moments (GMM) which has recently gained attention in causal inference. GMM is a special case of the broader family of empirical likelihood estimators which are based on approximating a population distribution by means of minimizing a $\varphi$-divergence to an empirical distribution. However, the use of $\varphi$-divergences effectively limits the candidate distributions to reweightings of the data samples. We lift this long-standing limitation and provide a method of moments that goes beyond data reweighting. This is achieved by defining an empirical likelihood estimator based on maximum mean discrepancy which we term the kernel method of moments (KMM). We provide a variant of our estimator for conditional moment restrictions and show that it is asymptotically first-order optimal for such problems. Finally, we show that our method achieves competitive performance on several conditional moment restriction tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kremer23a	Heiner Kremer, Yassine Nemmour, Bernhard Schölkopf, Jia-Jie Zhu
Gradient Descent Monotonically Decreases the Sharpness of Gradient Flow Solutions in Scalar Networks and Beyond	"Recent research shows that when Gradient Descent (GD) is applied to neural networks, the loss almost never decreases monotonically. Instead, the loss oscillates as gradient descent converges to its ""Edge of Stability"" (EoS). Here, we find a quantity that does decrease monotonically throughout GD training: the sharpness attained by the gradient flow solution (GFS)—the solution that would be obtained if, from now until convergence, we train with an infinitesimal step size. Theoretically, we analyze scalar neural networks with the squared loss, perhaps the simplest setting where the EoS phenomena still occur. In this model, we prove that the GFS sharpness decreases monotonically. Using this result, we characterize settings where GD provably converges to the EoS in scalar networks. Empirically, we show that GD monotonically decreases the GFS sharpness in a squared regression model as well as practical neural network architectures."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kreisler23a	Itai Kreisler, Mor Shpigel Nacson, Daniel Soudry, Yair Carmon
Variational Mixture of HyperGenerators for Learning Distributions over Functions	Recent approaches build on implicit neural representations (INRs) to propose generative models over function spaces. However, they are computationally costly when dealing with inference tasks, such as missing data imputation, or directly cannot tackle them. In this work, we propose a novel deep generative model, named VaMoH. VaMoH combines the capabilities of modeling continuous functions using INRs and the inference capabilities of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In addition, VaMoH relies on a normalizing flow to define the prior, and a mixture of hypernetworks to parametrize the data log-likelihood. This gives VaMoH a high expressive capability and interpretability. Through experiments on a diverse range of data types, such as images, voxels, and climate data, we show that VaMoH can effectively learn rich distributions over continuous functions. Furthermore, it can perform inference-related tasks, such as conditional super-resolution generation and in-painting, as well or better than previous approaches, while being less computationally demanding.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/koyuncu23a	Batuhan Koyuncu, Pablo Sanchez Martin, Ignacio Peis, Pablo M.

Benign Overfitting in Two-layer ReLU Convolutional Neural Networks	Modern deep learning models with great expressive power can be trained to overfit the training data but still generalize well. This phenomenon is referred to as benign overfitting. Recently, a few studies have attempted to theoretically understand benign overfitting in neural networks. However, these works are either limited to neural networks with smooth activation functions or to the neural tangent kernel regime. How and when benign overfitting can occur in ReLU neural networks remains an open problem. In this work, we seek to answer this question by establishing algorithm-dependent risk bounds for learning two-layer ReLU convolutional neural networks with label-flipping noise. We show that, under mild conditions, the neural network trained by gradient descent can achieve near-zero training loss and Bayes optimal test risk. Our result also reveals a sharp transition between benign and harmful overfitting under different conditions on data distribution in terms of test risk. Experiments on synthetic data back up our theory.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kou23a	Yiwen Kou, Zixiang Chen, Yuanzhou Chen, Quanquan Gu
Randomized Schur Complement Views for Graph Contrastive Learning	We introduce a randomized topological augmentor based on Schur complements for Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL). Given a graph laplacian matrix, the technique generates unbiased approximations of its Schur complements and treats the corresponding graphs as augmented views. We discuss the benefits of our approach, provide theoretical justifications and present connections with graph diffusion. Unlike previous efforts, we study the empirical effectiveness of the augmentor in a controlled fashion by varying the design choices for subsequent GCL phases, such as encoding and contrasting. Extensive experiments on node and graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that our technique consistently outperforms pre-defined and adaptive augmentation approaches to achieve state-of-the-art results.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kothapalli23a	Vignesh Kothapalli
TabDDPM: Modelling Tabular Data with Diffusion Models	Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are becoming the leading generative modeling paradigm for many important data modalities. Being the most prevalent in the computer vision community, diffusion models have recently gained some attention in other domains, including speech, NLP, and graph-like data. In this work, we investigate if the framework of diffusion models can be advantageous for general tabular problems, where data points are typically represented by vectors of heterogeneous features. The inherent heterogeneity of tabular data makes it quite challenging for accurate modeling since the individual features can be of a completely different nature, i.e., some of them can be continuous and some can be discrete. To address such data types, we introduce TabDDPM — a diffusion model that can be universally applied to any tabular dataset and handles any feature types. We extensively evaluate TabDDPM on a wide set of benchmarks and demonstrate its superiority over existing GAN/VAE alternatives, which is consistent with the advantage of diffusion models in other fields.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kotelnikov23a	Akim Kotelnikov, Dmitry Baranchuk, Ivan Rubachev, Artem Babenko
Ewald-based Long-Range Message Passing for Molecular Graphs	Neural architectures that learn potential energy surfaces from molecular data have undergone fast improvement in recent years. A key driver of this success is the Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) paradigm. Its favorable scaling with system size partly relies upon a spatial distance limit on messages. While this focus on locality is a useful inductive bias, it also impedes the learning of long-range interactions such as electrostatics and van der Waals forces. To address this drawback, we propose Ewald message passing: a nonlocal Fourier space scheme which limits interactions via a cutoff on frequency instead of distance, and is theoretically well-founded in the Ewald summation method. It can serve as an augmentation on top of existing MPNN architectures as it is computationally inexpensive and agnostic to architectural details. We test the approach with four baseline models and two datasets containing diverse periodic (OC20) and aperiodic structures (OE62). Across all models and datasets, we observe robust improvements in energy mean absolute errors, averaging 10% on OC20 and 16% on OE62. Our analysis shows an outsize impact of these improvements on structures with high long-range contributions to the ground-truth energy.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kosmala23a	Arthur Kosmala, Johannes Gasteiger, Nicholas Gao, Stephan Günnemann
Detecting Adversarial Directions in Deep Reinforcement Learning to Make Robust Decisions	Learning in MDPs with highly complex state representations is currently possible due to multiple advancements in reinforcement learning algorithm design. However, this incline in complexity, and furthermore the increase in the dimensions of the observation came at the cost of volatility that can be taken advantage of via adversarial attacks (i.e. moving along worst-case directions in the observation space). To solve this policy instability problem we propose a novel method to detect the presence of these non-robust directions via local quadratic approximation of the deep neural policy loss. Our method provides a theoretical basis for the fundamental cut-off between safe observations and adversarial observations. Furthermore, our technique is computationally efficient, and does not depend on the methods used to produce the worst-case directions. We conduct extensive experiments in the Arcade Learning Environment with several different adversarial attack techniques. Most significantly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach even in the setting where non-robust directions are explicitly optimized to circumvent our proposed method.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/korkmaz23a	Ezgi Korkmaz, Jonah Brown-Cohen
Pretraining Language Models with Human Preferences	Language models (LMs) are pretrained to imitate text from large and diverse datasets that contain content that would violate human preferences if generated by an LM: falsehoods, offensive comments, personally identifiable information, low-quality or buggy code, among others. Here, we explore alternative objectives for pretraining LMs in a way that also guides them to generate text aligned with human preferences. We benchmark five objectives for pretraining with human feedback across three tasks and study how they affect the alignment and capabilities of pretrained LMs. We find a Pareto-optimal and simple approach among those we explored: conditional training, or learning distribution over tokens conditional on their human preference scores. Conditional training reduces the rate of undesirable content by up to an order of magnitude, both when generating without a prompt and with an adversarially-chosen prompt. Moreover, conditional training maintains the downstream task performance of standard LM pretraining, both before and after task-specific finetuning. Pretraining with human feedback results in much better preference satisfaction than standard LM pretraining followed by finetuning with feedback, i.e., learning and then unlearning undesirable behavior. Our results suggest that we should move beyond imitation learning when pretraining LMs and incorporate human preferences from the start of training.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/korbak23a	Tomasz Korbak, Kejian Shi, Angelica Chen, Rasika Vinayak Bhalerao, Christopher Buckley, Jason Phang, Samuel R.

Parameter-Level Soft-Masking for Continual Learning	Existing research on task incremental learning in continual learning has primarily focused on preventing catastrophic forgetting (CF). Although several techniques have achieved learning with no CF, they attain it by letting each task monopolize a sub-network in a shared network, which seriously limits knowledge transfer (KT) and causes over-consumption of the network capacity, i.e., as more tasks are learned, the performance deteriorates. The goal of this paper is threefold: (1) overcoming CF, (2) encouraging KT, and (3) tackling the capacity problem. A novel technique (called SPG) is proposed that soft-masks (partially blocks) parameter updating in training based on the importance of each parameter to old tasks. Each task still uses the full network, i.e., no monopoly of any part of the network by any task, which enables maximum KT and reduction in capacity usage. To our knowledge, this is the first work that soft-masks a model at the parameter-level for continual learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SPG in achieving all three objectives. More notably, it attains significant transfer of knowledge not only among similar tasks (with shared knowledge) but also among dissimilar tasks (with little shared knowledge) while mitigating CF.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/konishi23a	Tatsuya Konishi, Mori Kurokawa, Chihiro Ono, Zixuan Ke, Gyuhak Kim, Bing Liu
Masked Bayesian Neural Networks : Theoretical Guarantee and its Posterior Inference	Bayesian approaches for learning deep neural networks (BNN) have been received much attention and successfully applied to various applications. Particularly, BNNs have the merit of having better generalization ability as well as better uncertainty quantification. For the success of BNN, search an appropriate architecture of the neural networks is an important task, and various algorithms to find good sparse neural networks have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a new node-sparse BNN model which has good theoretical properties and is computationally feasible. We prove that the posterior concentration rate to the true model is near minimax optimal and adaptive to the smoothness of the true model. In particular the adaptiveness is the first of its kind for node-sparse BNNs. In addition, we develop a novel MCMC algorithm which makes the Bayesian inference of the node-sparse BNN model feasible in practice.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kong23e	Insung Kong, Dongyoon Yang, Jongjin Lee, Ilsang Ohn, Gyuseung Baek, Yongdai Kim
Covariate balancing using the integral probability metric for causal inference	Weighting methods in causal inference have been widely used to achieve a desirable level of covariate balancing. However, the existing weighting methods have desirable theoretical properties only when a certain model, either the propensity score or outcome regression model, is correctly specified. In addition, the corresponding estimators do not behave well for finite samples due to large variance even when the model is correctly specified. In this paper, we consider to use the integral probability metric (IPM), which is a metric between two probability measures, for covariate balancing. Optimal weights are determined so that weighted empirical distributions for the treated and control groups have the smallest IPM value for a given set of discriminators. We prove that the corresponding estimator can be consistent without correctly specifying any model (neither the propensity score nor the outcome regression model). In addition, we empirically show that our proposed method outperforms existing weighting methods with large margins for finite samples.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kong23d	Insung Kong, Yuha Park, Joonhyuk Jung, Kwonsang Lee, Yongdai Kim
End-to-End Full-Atom Antibody Design	Antibody design is an essential yet challenging task in various domains like therapeutics and biology. There are two major defects in current learning-based methods: 1) tackling only a certain subtask of the whole antibody design pipeline, making them suboptimal or resource-intensive. 2) omitting either the framework regions or side chains, thus incapable of capturing the full-atom geometry. To address these pitfalls, we propose dynamic Multi-channel Equivariant grAph Network (dyMEAN), an end-to-end full-atom model for E(3)-equivariant antibody design given the epitope and the incomplete sequence of the antibody. Specifically, we first explore structural initialization as a knowledgeable guess of the antibody structure and then propose shadow paratope to bridge the epitope-antibody connections. Both 1D sequences and 3D structures are updated via an adaptive multi-channel equivariant encoder that is able to process protein residues of variable sizes when considering full atoms. Finally, the updated antibody is docked to the epitope via the alignment of the shadow paratope. Experiments on epitope-binding CDR-H3 design, complex structure prediction, and affinity optimization demonstrate the superiority of our end-to-end framework and full-atom modeling.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kong23c	Xiangzhe Kong, Wenbing Huang, Yang Liu
Autoregressive Diffusion Model for Graph Generation	Diffusion-based graph generative models have recently obtained promising results for graph generation.

GOAT: A Global Transformer on Large-scale Graphs	Graph transformers have been competitive on graph classification tasks, but they fail to outperform Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on node classification, which is a common task performed on large-scale graphs for industrial applications. Meanwhile, existing GNN architectures are limited in their ability to perform equally well on both homophilious and heterophilious graphs as their inductive biases are generally tailored to only one setting. To address these issues, we propose GOAT, a scalable global graph transformer. In GOAT, each node conceptually attends to all the nodes in the graph and homophily/heterophily relationships can be learnt adaptively from the data. We provide theoretical justification for our approximate global self-attention scheme, and show it to be scalable to large-scale graphs. We demonstrate the competitiveness of GOAT on both heterophilious and homophilious graphs with millions of nodes.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kong23a	Kezhi Kong, Jiuhai Chen, John Kirchenbauer, Renkun Ni, C.

On Computing Optimal Tree Ensembles	Random forests and, more generally, (decision-)tree ensembles are widely used methods for classification and regression. Recent algorithmic advances allow to compute decision trees that are optimal for various measures such as their size or depth. We are not aware of such research for tree ensembles and aim to contribute to this area. Mainly, we provide two novel algorithms and corresponding lower bounds. First, we are able to carry over and substantially improve on tractability results for decision trees, obtaining a $(6\delta D S)^S \cdot \mathrm{poly}$-time algorithm, where $S$ is the number of cuts in the tree ensemble, $D$ the largest domain size, and $\delta$ is the largest number of features in which two examples differ. To achieve this, we introduce the witness-tree technique which also seems promising for practice. Second, we show that dynamic programming, which has been successful for decision trees, may also be viable for tree ensembles, providing an $\ell^n \cdot \mathrm{poly}$-time algorithm, where $\ell$ is the number of trees and $n$ the number of examples. Finally, we compare the number of cuts necessary to classify training data sets for decision trees and tree ensembles, showing that ensembles may need exponentially fewer cuts for increasing number of trees.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/komusiewicz23a	Christian Komusiewicz, Pascal Kunz, Frank Sommer, Manuel Sorge
Revisiting Gradient Clipping: Stochastic bias and tight convergence guarantees	Gradient clipping is a popular modification to standard (stochastic) gradient descent, at every iteration limiting the gradient norm to a certain value $c >0$. It is widely used for example for stabilizing the training of deep learning models (Goodfellow et al., 2016), or for enforcing differential privacy (Abadi et al., 2016). Despite popularity and simplicity of the clipping mechanism, its convergence guarantees often require specific values of $c$ and strong noise assumptions. In this paper, we give convergence guarantees that show precise dependence on arbitrary clipping thresholds $c$ and show that our guarantees are tight with both deterministic and stochastic gradients. In particular, we show that (i) for deterministic gradient descent, the clipping threshold only affects the higher-order terms of convergence, (ii) in the stochastic setting convergence to the true optimum cannot be guaranteed under the standard noise assumption, even under arbitrary small step-sizes. We give matching upper and lower bounds for convergence of the gradient norm when running clipped SGD, and illustrate these results with experiments.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/koloskova23a	Anastasia Koloskova, Hadrien Hendrikx, Sebastian U Stich
Enabling First-Order Gradient-Based Learning for Equilibrium Computation in Markets	Understanding and analyzing markets is crucial, yet analytical equilibrium solutions remain largely infeasible. Recent breakthroughs in equilibrium computation rely on zeroth-order policy gradient estimation. These approaches commonly suffer from high variance and are computationally expensive. The use of fully differentiable simulators would enable more efficient gradient estimation. However, the discrete allocation of goods in economic simulations is a non-differentiable operation. This renders the first-order Monte Carlo gradient estimator inapplicable and the learning feedback systematically misleading. We propose a novel smoothing technique that creates a surrogate market game, in which first-order methods can be applied. We provide theoretical bounds on the resulting bias which justifies solving the smoothed game instead. These bounds also allow choosing the smoothing strength a priori such that the resulting estimate has low variance. Furthermore, we validate our approach via numerous empirical experiments. Our method theoretically and empirically outperforms zeroth-order methods in approximation quality and computational efficiency.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kohring23a	Nils Kohring, Fabian Raoul Pieroth, Martin Bichler
Rigid Body Flows for Sampling Molecular Crystal Structures	Normalizing flows (NF) are a class of powerful generative models that have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to model complex distributions with high flexibility and expressiveness. In this work, we introduce a new type of normalizing flow that is tailored for modeling positions and orientations of multiple objects in three-dimensional space, such as molecules in a crystal. Our approach is based on two key ideas: first, we define smooth and expressive flows on the group of unit quaternions, which allows us to capture the continuous rotational motion of rigid bodies; second, we use the double cover property of unit quaternions to define a proper density on the rotation group. This ensures that our model can be trained using standard likelihood-based methods or variational inference with respect to a thermodynamic target density. We evaluate the method by training Boltzmann generators for two molecular examples, namely the multi-modal density of a tetrahedral system in an external field and the ice XI phase in the TIP4P water model. Our flows can be combined with flows operating on the internal degrees of freedom of molecules and constitute an important step towards the modeling of distributions of many interacting molecules.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kohler23a	Jonas Köhler, Michele Invernizzi, Pim De Haan, Frank Noe
Grounding Language Models to Images for Multimodal Inputs and Outputs	We propose an efficient method to ground pretrained text-only language models to the visual domain, enabling them to process arbitrarily interleaved image-and-text data, and generate text interleaved with retrieved images. Our method leverages the abilities of language models learnt from large scale text-only pretraining, such as in-context learning and free-form text generation. We keep the language model frozen, and finetune input and output linear layers to enable cross-modality interactions. This allows our model to process arbitrarily interleaved image-and-text inputs, and generate free-form text interleaved with retrieved images. We achieve strong zero-shot performance on grounded tasks such as contextual image retrieval and multimodal dialogue, and showcase compelling interactive abilities. Our approach works with any off-the-shelf language model and paves the way towards an effective, general solution for leveraging pretrained language models in visually grounded settings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/koh23a	Jing Yu Koh, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Daniel Fried
Online Learning with Feedback Graphs: The True Shape of Regret	Sequential learning with feedback graphs is a natural extension of the multi-armed bandit problem where the problem is equipped with an underlying graph structure that provides additional information - playing an action reveals the losses of all the neighbors of the action. This problem was introduced by Mannor & Shamir (2011) and received considerable attention in recent years. It is generally stated in the literature that the minimax regret rate for this problem is of order $\sqrt{\alpha T}$, where $\alpha$ is the independence number of the graph, and $T$ is the time horizon. However, this is proven only when the number of rounds $T$ is larger than $\alpha^3$, which poses a significant restriction for the usability of this result in large graphs. In this paper, we define a new quantity $R^*$, called the	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kocak23a	Tomáš Kocák, Alexandra Carpentier
Can We Scale Transformers to Predict Parameters of Diverse ImageNet Models?	Pretraining a neural network on a large dataset is becoming a cornerstone in machine learning that is within the reach of only a few communities with large-resources. We aim at an ambitious goal of democratizing pretraining. Towards that goal, we train and release a single neural network that can predict high quality ImageNet parameters of other neural networks. By using predicted parameters for initialization we are able to boost training of diverse ImageNet models available in PyTorch. When transferred to other datasets, models initialized with predicted parameters also converge faster and reach competitive final performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/knyazev23a	Boris Knyazev, Doha Hwang, Simon Lacoste-Julien
Generalized Reductions: Making any Hierarchical Clustering Fair and Balanced with Low Cost	Clustering is a fundamental building block of modern statistical analysis pipelines. Fair clustering has seen much attention from the machine learning community in recent years. We are some of the first to study fairness in the context of hierarchical clustering, after the results of Ahmadian et al. from NeurIPS in 2020. We evaluate our results using Dasgupta's cost function, perhaps one of the most prevalent theoretical metrics for hierarchical clustering evaluation. Our work vastly improves the previous $O(n^{5/6}poly\log(n))$ fair approximation for cost to a near polylogarithmic $O(n^\delta poly\log(n))$ fair approximation for any constant $\delta\in(0,1)$. This result establishes a cost fairness tradeoff and extends to broader fairness constraints than the previous work. We also show how to alter existing hierarchical clusterings to guarantee fairness and cluster balance across any level in the hierarchy.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/knittel23a	Marina Knittel, Max Springer, John P Dickerson, Mohammadtaghi Hajiaghayi
Deep Laplacian-based Options for Temporally-Extended Exploration	Selecting exploratory actions that generate a rich stream of experience for better learning is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). An approach to tackle this problem consists in selecting actions according to specific policies for an extended period of time, also known as options. A recent line of work to derive such exploratory options builds upon the eigenfunctions of the graph Laplacian. Importantly, until now these methods have been mostly limited to tabular domains where (1) the graph Laplacian matrix was either given or could be fully estimated, (2) performing eigendecomposition on this matrix was computationally tractable, and (3) value functions could be learned exactly. Additionally, these methods required a separate option discovery phase. These assumptions are fundamentally not scalable. In this paper we address these limitations and show how recent results for directly approximating the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian can be leveraged to truly scale up options-based exploration. To do so, we introduce a fully online deep RL algorithm for discovering Laplacian-based options and evaluate our approach on a variety of pixel-based tasks. We compare to several state-of-the-art exploration methods and show that our approach is effective, general, and especially promising in non-stationary settings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/klissarov23a	Martin Klissarov, Marlos C.

Drug Discovery under Covariate Shift with Domain-Informed Prior Distributions over Functions	Accelerating the discovery of novel and more effective therapeutics is an important pharmaceutical problem in which deep learning is playing an increasingly significant role. However, real-world drug discovery tasks are often characterized by a scarcity of labeled data and significant covariate shift—a setting that poses a challenge to standard deep learning methods. In this paper, we present Q-SAVI, a probabilistic model able to address these challenges by encoding explicit prior knowledge of the data-generating process into a prior distribution over functions, presenting researchers with a transparent and probabilistically principled way to encode data-driven modeling preferences. Building on a novel, gold-standard bioactivity dataset that facilitates a meaningful comparison of models in an extrapolative regime, we explore different approaches to induce data shift and construct a challenging evaluation setup. We then demonstrate that using Q-SAVI to integrate contextualized prior knowledge of drug-like chemical space into the modeling process affords substantial gains in predictive accuracy and calibration, outperforming a broad range of state-of-the-art self-supervised pre-training and domain adaptation techniques.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/klarner23a	Leo Klarner, Tim G.

Regularization and Variance-Weighted Regression Achieves Minimax Optimality in Linear MDPs: Theory and Practice	Mirror descent value iteration (MDVI), an abstraction of Kullback-Leibler (KL) and entropy-regularized reinforcement learning (RL), has served as the basis for recent high-performing practical RL algorithms. However, despite the use of function approximation in practice, the theoretical understanding of MDVI has been limited to tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs). We study MDVI with linear function approximation through its sample complexity required to identify an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy with probability $1-\delta$ under the settings of an infinite-horizon linear MDP, generative model, and G-optimal design. We demonstrate that least-squares regression weighted by the variance of an estimated optimal value function of the next state is crucial to achieving minimax optimality. Based on this observation, we present Variance-Weighted Least-Squares MDVI (VWLS-MDVI), the first theoretical algorithm that achieves nearly minimax optimal sample complexity for infinite-horizon linear MDPs. Furthermore, we propose a practical VWLS algorithm for value-based deep RL, Deep Variance Weighting (DVW). Our experiments demonstrate that DVW improves the performance of popular value-based deep RL algorithms on a set of MinAtar benchmarks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kitamura23a	Toshinori Kitamura, Tadashi Kozuno, Yunhao Tang, Nino Vieillard, Michal Valko, Wenhao Yang, Jincheng Mei, Pierre Menard, Mohammad Gheshlaghi Azar, Remi Munos, Olivier Pietquin, Matthieu Geist, Csaba Szepesvari, Wataru Kumagai, Yutaka Matsuo
IncDSI: Incrementally Updatable Document Retrieval	Differentiable Search Index is a recently proposed paradigm for document retrieval, that encodes information about a corpus of documents within the parameters of a neural network and directly maps queries to corresponding documents. These models have achieved state-of-the-art performances for document retrieval across many benchmarks. These kinds of models have a significant limitation: it is not easy to add new documents after a model is trained. We propose IncDSI, a method to add documents in real time (about 20-50ms per document), without retraining the model on the entire dataset (or even parts thereof). Instead we formulate the addition of documents as a constrained optimization problem that makes minimal changes to the network parameters. Although orders of magnitude faster, our approach is competitive with re-training the model on the whole dataset and enables the development of document retrieval systems that can be updated with new information in real-time. Our code for IncDSI is available at https://github.com/varshakishore/IncDSI.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kishore23a	Varsha Kishore, Chao Wan, Justin Lovelace, Yoav Artzi, Kilian Q Weinberger
Training Normalizing Flows from Dependent Data	Normalizing flows are powerful non-parametric statistical models that function as a hybrid between density estimators and generative models. Current learning algorithms for normalizing flows assume that data points are sampled independently, an assumption that is frequently violated in practice, which may lead to erroneous density estimation and data generation. We propose a likelihood objective of normalizing flows incorporating dependencies between the data points, for which we derive a flexible and efficient learning algorithm suitable for different dependency structures. We show that respecting dependencies between observations can improve empirical results on both synthetic and real-world data, and leads to higher statistical power in a downstream application to genome-wide association studies.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kirchler23a	Matthias Kirchler, Christoph Lippert, Marius Kloft
Probabilistic Contrastive Learning Recovers the Correct Aleatoric Uncertainty of Ambiguous Inputs	Contrastively trained encoders have recently been proven to invert the data-generating process: they encode each input, e.g., an image, into the true latent vector that generated the image (Zimmermann et al., 2021). However, real-world observations often have inherent ambiguities. For instance, images may be blurred or only show a 2D view of a 3D object, so multiple latents could have generated them. This makes the true posterior for the latent vector probabilistic with heteroscedastic uncertainty. In this setup, we extend the common InfoNCE objective and encoders to predict latent distributions instead of points. We prove that these distributions recover the correct posteriors of the data-generating process, including its level of aleatoric uncertainty, up to a rotation of the latent space. In addition to providing calibrated uncertainty estimates, these posteriors allow the computation of credible intervals in image retrieval. They comprise images with the same latent as a given query, subject to its uncertainty.

A Watermark for Large Language Models	"Potential harms of large language models can be mitigated by watermarking model output, i.e., embedding signals into generated text that are invisible to humans but algorithmically detectable from a short span of tokens. We propose a watermarking framework for proprietary language models. The watermark can be embedded with negligible impact on text quality, and can be detected using an efficient open-source algorithm without access to the language model API or parameters. The watermark works by selecting a randomized set of ""green"" tokens before a word is generated, and then softly promoting use of green tokens during sampling. We propose a statistical test for detecting the watermark with interpretable p-values, and derive an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the sensitivity of the watermark. We test the watermark using a multi-billion parameter model from the Open Pretrained Transformer (OPT) family, and discuss robustness and security."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kirchenbauer23a	John Kirchenbauer, Jonas Geiping, Yuxin Wen, Jonathan Katz, Ian Miers, Tom Goldstein
Controlling Posterior Collapse by an Inverse Lipschitz Constraint on the Decoder Network	Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are one of the deep generative models that have experienced enormous success over the past decades. However, in practice, they suffer from a problem called posterior collapse, which occurs when the posterior distribution coincides, or collapses, with the prior taking no information from the latent structure of the input data into consideration. In this work, we introduce an inverse Lipschitz neural network into the decoder and, based on this architecture, provide a new method that can control in a simple and clear manner the degree of posterior collapse for a wide range of VAE models equipped with a concrete theoretical guarantee. We also illustrate the effectiveness of our method through several numerical experiments.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kinoshita23a	Yuri Kinoshita, Kenta Oono, Kenji Fukumizu, Yuichi Yoshida, Shin-Ichi Maeda
Proper Losses for Discrete Generative Models	We initiate the study of proper losses for evaluating generative models in the discrete setting. Unlike traditional proper losses, we treat both the generative model and the target distribution as black-boxes, only assuming ability to draw i.i.d. samples. We define a loss to be black-box proper if the generative distribution that minimizes expected loss is equal to the target distribution. Using techniques from statistical estimation theory, we give a general construction and characterization of black-box proper losses: they must take a polynomial form, and the number of draws from the model and target distribution must exceed the degree of the polynomial. The characterization rules out a loss whose expectation is the cross-entropy between the target distribution and the model. By extending the construction to arbitrary sampling schemes such as Poisson sampling, however, we show that one can construct such a loss.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kimpara23a	Dhamma Kimpara, Rafael Frongillo, Bo Waggoner
Fair and Robust Estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects for Policy Learning	We propose a simple and general framework for nonparametric estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects under fairness constraints. Under standard regularity conditions, we show that the resulting estimators possess the double robustness property. We use this framework to characterize the trade-off between fairness and the maximum welfare achievable by the optimal policy. We evaluate the methods in a simulation study and illustrate them in a real-world case study.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23ab	Kwangho Kim, Jose R Zubizarreta
Structure Learning of Latent Factors via Clique Search on Correlation Thresholded Graphs	Despite the widespread application of latent factor analysis, existing methods suffer from the following weaknesses: requiring the number of factors to be known, lack of theoretical guarantees for learning the model structure, and nonidentifiability of the parameters due to rotation invariance properties of the likelihood. We address these concerns by proposing a fast correlation thresholding (CT) algorithm that simultaneously learns the number of latent factors and a rotationally identifiable model structure. Our novel approach translates this structure learning problem into the search for so-called independent maximal cliques in a thresholded correlation graph that can be easily constructed from the observed data. Our clique analysis technique scales well up to thousands of variables, while competing methods are not applicable in a reasonable amount of running time. We establish a finite-sample error bound and high-dimensional consistency for the structure learning of our method. Through a series of simulation studies and a real data example, we show that the CT algorithm is an accurate method for learning the structure of factor analysis models and is robust to violations of its assumptions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23aa	Dale Kim, Qing Zhou
Denoising MCMC for Accelerating Diffusion-Based Generative Models	The sampling process of diffusion models can be interpreted as solving the reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) or the ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the diffusion process, which often requires up to thousands of discretization steps to generate a single image. This has sparked a great interest in developing efficient integration techniques for reverse-S/ODEs. Here, we propose an orthogonal approach to accelerating score-based sampling: Denoising MCMC (DMCMC). DMCMC first uses MCMC to produce initialization points for reverse-S/ODE in the product space of data and diffusion time. Then, a reverse-S/ODE integrator is used to denoise the initialization points. Since MCMC traverses close to the data manifold, the cost of producing a clean sample for DMCMC is much less than that of producing a clean sample from noise. Denoising Langevin Gibbs, an instance of DMCMC, successfully accelerates all six reverse-S/ODE integrators considered in this work, and achieves state-of-the-art results: in the limited number of score function evaluation (NFE) setting on CIFAR10, we have $3.25$ FID with $\approx 10$ NFE and $2.49$ FID with $\approx 16$ NFE. On CelebA-HQ-256, we have $6.99$ FID with $\approx 160$ NFE, which beats the current best record of Kim et al. (2022) among score-based models, $7.16$ FID with $4000$ NFE.

Unifying Nesterov’s Accelerated Gradient Methods for Convex and Strongly Convex Objective Functions	Although Nesterov's accelerated gradient method (AGM) has been studied from various perspectives, it remains unclear why the most popular forms of AGMs must handle convex and strongly convex objective functions separately. To address this inconsistency, we propose a novel unified framework for Lagrangians, ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, and algorithms. As a special case, our new simple momentum algorithm, which we call the unified AGM, seamlessly bridges the gap between the two most popular forms of Nesterov's AGM and has a superior convergence guarantee compared to existing algorithms for non-strongly convex objective functions. This property is beneficial in practice when considering ill-conditioned $\mu$-strongly convex objective functions (with small $\mu$). Furthermore, we generalize this algorithm and the corresponding ODE model to the higher-order non-Euclidean setting. Last but not least, our unified framework is used to construct the unified AGM-G ODE, a novel ODE model for minimizing the gradient norm of strongly convex functions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23y	Jungbin Kim, Insoon Yang
Learnability and Algorithm for Continual Learning	This paper studies the challenging continual learning (CL) setting of Class Incremental Learning (CIL). CIL learns a sequence of tasks consisting of disjoint sets of concepts or classes. At any time, a single model is built that can be applied to predict/classify test instances of any classes learned thus far without providing any task related information for each test instance. Although many techniques have been proposed for CIL, they are mostly empirical. It has been shown recently that a strong CIL system needs a strong within-task prediction (WP) and a strong out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for each task. However, it is still not known whether CIL is actually learnable. This paper shows that CIL is learnable. Based on the theory, a new CIL algorithm is also proposed. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23x	Gyuhak Kim, Changnan Xiao, Tatsuya Konishi, Bing Liu
Practical and Matching Gradient Variance Bounds for Black-Box Variational Bayesian Inference	Understanding the gradient variance of black-box variational inference (BBVI) is a crucial step for establishing its convergence and developing algorithmic improvements. However, existing studies have yet to show that the gradient variance of BBVI satisfies the conditions used to study the convergence of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), the workhorse of BBVI. In this work, we show that BBVI satisfies a matching bound corresponding to the ABC condition used in the SGD literature when applied to smooth and quadratically-growing log-likelihoods. Our results generalize to nonlinear covariance parameterizations widely used in the practice of BBVI. Furthermore, we show that the variance of the mean-field parameterization has provably superior dimensional dependence.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23w	Kyurae Kim, Kaiwen Wu, Jisu Oh, Jacob R.

An Adaptive Entropy-Regularization Framework for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning	In this paper, we propose an adaptive entropy-regularization framework (ADER) for multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the adequate amount of exploration of each agent for entropy-based exploration. In order to derive a metric for the proper level of exploration entropy for each agent, we disentangle the soft value function into two types: one for pure return and the other for entropy. By applying multi-agent value factorization to the disentangled value function of pure return, we obtain a metric to determine the relevant level of exploration entropy for each agent, given by the partial derivative of the pure-return value function with respect to (w.r.t.) the policy entropy of each agent. Based on this metric, we propose the ADER algorithm based on maximum entropy RL, which controls the necessary level of exploration across agents over time by learning the proper target entropy for each agent. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art multi-agent RL algorithms.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23v	Woojun Kim, Youngchul Sung
Prefer to Classify: Improving Text Classifiers via Auxiliary Preference Learning	The development of largely human-annotated benchmarks has driven the success of deep neural networks in various NLP tasks. To enhance the effectiveness of existing benchmarks, collecting new additional input-output pairs is often too costly and challenging, particularly considering their marginal impact on improving the current model accuracy. Instead, additional or complementary annotations on the existing input texts in the benchmarks can be preferable as an efficient way to pay the additional human cost. In this paper, we investigate task-specific preferences between pairs of input texts as a new alternative way for such auxiliary data annotation. From pair-wise comparisons with respect to the task, the auxiliary preference learning enables the model to learn an additional informative training signal that cannot be captured with instance-wise task labels. To this end, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework, called prefer-to-classify (P2C), which can enjoy the cooperative effect of learning both the given classification task and the auxiliary preferences. Here, we provide three different ways to collect preference signals in practice: (a) implicitly extracting from annotation records (for free, but often unavailable), (b) collecting explicitly from crowd workers (high paid), or (c) pre-trained large language models such as GPT-3 (low paid). Given existing classification NLP benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed auxiliary preference learning via P2C on them is effective in improving text classifiers.

Stable and Consistent Prediction of 3D Characteristic Orientation via Invariant Residual Learning	Learning to predict reliable characteristic orientations of 3D point clouds is an important yet challenging problem, as different point clouds of the same class may have largely varying appearances. In this work, we introduce a novel method to decouple the shape geometry and semantics of the input point cloud to achieve both stability and consistency. The proposed method integrates shape-geometry-based SO(3)-equivariant learning and shape-semantics-based SO(3)-invariant residual learning, where a final characteristic orientation is obtained by calibrating an SO(3)-equivariant orientation hypothesis using an SO(3)-invariant residual rotation. In experiments, the proposed method not only demonstrates superior stability and consistency but also exhibits state-of-the-art performances when applied to point cloud part segmentation, given randomly rotated inputs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23t	Seungwook Kim, Chunghyun Park, Yoonwoo Jeong, Jaesik Park, Minsu Cho
SurProGenes: Survival Risk-Ordered Representation of Cancer Patients and Genes for the Identification of Prognostic Genes	Identifying prognostic genes associated with patient survival is an important goal in cancer genomics, as this information could inform treatment approaches and improve patient outcomes. However, the identification of prognostic genes is complicated by the high dimensionality of genetic data, which makes their identification computationally intensive. Furthermore, most cancer genomics studies lack appropriate low-risk groups against which to compare. To address these issues, we present a framework that identifies candidate prognostic genes by integrating representation learning and statistical analysis approaches. Specifically, we propose a collaborative filtering-derived mechanism to represent patients in order of their survival risk, facilitating their dichotomization. We also propose a mechanism that allows embedded gene vectors to be polarized on the extremities of, or centered on, both reference axes to facilitate recommendations. Restricting our analysis to a few representative genes within each cluster allowed for the efficient identification of prognostic genes. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of this proposed framework for identifying prognostic genes.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23s	Junetae Kim, Kyoungsuk Park, Hanseok Jeong, Youngwook Kim, Jeongseon Kim, Sun-Young Kim
Transformer-based Stagewise Decomposition for Large-Scale Multistage Stochastic Optimization	Solving large-scale multistage stochastic programming (MSP) problems poses a significant challenge as commonly used stagewise decomposition algorithms, including stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP), face growing time complexity as the subproblem size and problem count increase. Traditional approaches approximate the value functions as piecewise linear convex functions by incrementally accumulating subgradient cutting planes from the primal and dual solutions of stagewise subproblems. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce TranSDDP, a novel Transformer-based stagewise decomposition algorithm. This innovative approach leverages the structural advantages of the Transformer model, implementing a sequential method for integrating subgradient cutting planes to approximate the value function. Through our numerical experiments, we affirm TranSDDP's effectiveness in addressing MSP problems. It efficiently generates a piecewise linear approximation for the value function, significantly reducing computation time while preserving solution quality, thus marking a promising progression in the treatment of large-scale multistage stochastic programming problems.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23r	Chanyeong Kim, Jongwoong Park, Hyunglip Bae, Woo Chang Kim
Model-based Offline Reinforcement Learning with Count-based Conservatism	In this paper, we present a model-based offline reinforcement learning method that integrates count-based conservatism, named $\texttt{Count-MORL}$. Our method utilizes the count estimates of state-action pairs to quantify model estimation error, marking the first algorithm of demonstrating the efficacy of count-based conservatism in model-based offline deep RL to the best of our knowledge. For our proposed method, we first show that the estimation error is inversely proportional to the frequency of state-action pairs. Secondly, we demonstrate that the learned policy under the count-based conservative model offers near-optimality performance guarantees. Through extensive numerical experiments, we validate that $\texttt{Count-MORL}$ with hash code implementation significantly outperforms existing offline RL algorithms on the D4RL benchmark datasets.

Regularizing Towards Soft Equivariance Under Mixed Symmetries	Datasets often have their intrinsic symmetries, and particular deep-learning models called equivariant or invariant models have been developed to exploit these symmetries. However, if some or all of these symmetries are only approximate, which frequently happens in practice, these models may be suboptimal due to the architectural restrictions imposed on them. We tackle this issue of approximate symmetries in a setup where symmetries are mixed, i.e., they are symmetries of not single but multiple different types and the degree of approximation varies across these types. Instead of proposing a new architectural restriction as in most of the previous approaches, we present a regularizer-based method for building a model for a dataset with mixed approximate symmetries. The key component of our method is what we call equivariance regularizer for a given type of symmetries, which measures how much a model is equivariant with respect to the symmetries of the type. Our method is trained with these regularizers, one per each symmetry type, and the strength of the regularizers is automatically tuned during training, leading to the discovery of the approximation levels of some candidate symmetry types without explicit supervision. Using synthetic function approximation and motion forecasting tasks, we demonstrate that our method achieves better accuracy than prior approaches while discovering the approximate symmetry levels correctly.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23p	Hyunsu Kim, Hyungi Lee, Hongseok Yang, Juho Lee
Margin-based Neural Network Watermarking	As Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms become prevalent, deep neural network (DNN) watermarking techniques are gaining increasing attention, which enables one to verify the ownership of a target DNN model in a black-box scenario. Unfortunately, previous watermarking methods are vulnerable to functionality stealing attacks, thus allowing an adversary to falsely claim the ownership of a DNN model stolen from its original owner. In this work, we propose a novel margin-based DNN watermarking approach that is robust to the functionality stealing attacks based on model extraction and distillation. Specifically, during training, our method maximizes the margins of watermarked samples by using projected gradient ascent on them so that their predicted labels cannot change without compromising the accuracy of the model that the attacker tries to steal. We validate our method on multiple benchmarks and show that our watermarking method successfully defends against model extraction attacks, outperforming recent baselines.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23o	Byungjoo Kim, Suyoung Lee, Seanie Lee, Sooel Son, Sung Ju Hwang
Variational Curriculum Reinforcement Learning for Unsupervised Discovery of Skills	Mutual information-based reinforcement learning (RL) has been proposed as a promising framework for retrieving complex skills autonomously without a task-oriented reward function through mutual information (MI) maximization or variational empowerment. However, learning complex skills is still challenging, due to the fact that the order of training skills can largely affect sample efficiency. Inspired by this, we recast variational empowerment as curriculum learning in goal-conditioned RL with an intrinsic reward function, which we name Variational Curriculum RL (VCRL). From this perspective, we propose a novel approach to unsupervised skill discovery based on information theory, called Value Uncertainty Variational Curriculum (VUVC). We prove that, under regularity conditions, VUVC accelerates the increase of entropy in the visited states compared to the uniform curriculum. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on complex navigation and robotic manipulation tasks in terms of sample efficiency and state coverage speed. We also demonstrate that the skills discovered by our method successfully complete a real-world robot navigation task in a zero-shot setup and that incorporating these skills with a global planner further increases the performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23n	Seongun Kim, Kyowoon Lee, Jaesik Choi
Probabilistic Imputation for Time-series Classification with Missing Data	Multivariate time series data for real-world applications typically contain a significant amount of missing values. The dominant approach for classification with such missing values is to impute them heuristically with specific values (zero, mean, values of adjacent time-steps) or learnable parameters. However, these simple strategies do not take the data generative process into account, and more importantly, do not effectively capture the uncertainty in prediction due to the multiple possibilities for the missing values. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic framework for classification with multivariate time series data with missing values. Our model consists of two parts; a deep generative model for missing value imputation and a classifier. Extending the existing deep generative models to better capture structures of time-series data, our deep generative model part is trained to impute the missing values in multiple plausible ways, effectively modeling the uncertainty of the imputation. The classifier part takes the time series data along with the imputed missing values and classifies signals, and is trained to capture the predictive uncertainty due to the multiple possibilities of imputations. Importantly, we show that naïvely combining the generative model and the classifier could result in trivial solutions where the generative model does not produce meaningful imputations. To resolve this, we present a novel regularization technique that can promote the model to produce useful imputation values that help classification. Through extensive experiments on real-world time series data with missing values, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23m	Seunghyun Kim, Hyunsu Kim, Eunggu Yun, Hwangrae Lee, Jaehun Lee, Juho Lee
BPipe: Memory-Balanced Pipeline Parallelism for Training Large Language Models	Pipeline parallelism is a key technique for training large language models within GPU clusters. However, it often leads to a memory imbalance problem, where certain GPUs face high memory pressure while others underutilize their capacity. This imbalance results in suboptimal training performance, even when the overall GPU memory capacity is sufficient for more efficient setups. To address this inefficiency, we propose BPipe, a novel approach for achieving memory balance in pipeline parallelism. BPipe employs an activation balancing method to transfer intermediate activations between GPUs during training, enabling all GPUs to utilize comparable amounts of memory. With balanced memory utilization, BPipe enhances the training efficiency of large language models like GPT-3 by eliminating redundant recomputations or increasing the micro-batch size. Our evaluation conducted on 48 A100 GPUs across six nodes interconnected with HDR InfiniBand shows that BPipe accelerates the training of GPT-3 96B and GPT-3 134B models by 1.25x-2.17x compared to Megatron-LM, a state-of-the-art framework for training large language models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23l	Taebum Kim, Hyoungjoo Kim, Gyeong-In Yu, Byung-Gon Chun

The effectiveness of the proposed exploration framework is demonstrated by various experiments in the MiniGrid and Atari environments.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23k	Woojun Kim, Jeonghye Kim, Youngchul Sung
Robust Non-Linear Feedback Coding via Power-Constrained Deep Learning	The design of codes for feedback-enabled communications has been a long-standing open problem. Recent research on non-linear, deep learning-based coding schemes have demonstrated significant improvements in communication reliability over linear codes, but are still vulnerable to the presence of forward and feedback noise over the channel. In this paper, we develop a new family of non-linear feedback codes that greatly enhance robustness to channel noise. Our autoencoder-based architecture is designed to learn codes based on consecutive blocks of bits, which obtains de-noising advantages over bit-by-bit processing to help overcome the physical separation between the encoder and decoder over a noisy channel. Moreover, we develop a power control layer at the encoder to explicitly incorporate hardware constraints into the learning optimization, and prove that the resulting average power constraint is satisfied asymptotically. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art feedback codes by wide margins over practical forward and feedback noise regimes, and provide information-theoretic insights on the behavior of our non-linear codes. Moreover, we observe that, in a long blocklength regime, canonical error correction codes are still preferable to feedback codes when the feedback noise becomes high.

Despite the demonstrated efficacy of transformers in domains including natural language processing and computer vision, their use in hardware design has been limited by the scarcity of offline data. Our approach addresses this limitation by introducing strong inductive biases such as relative positional embeddings and action-permutation symmetricity that effectively capture the hardware context and enable efficient design optimization with limited offline data. We apply DevFormer to the problem of decoupling capacitor placement and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both simulated and real hardware, leading to improved performances while reducing the number of components by more than 30%. Finally, we show that our approach achieves promising results in other offline contextual learning-based combinatorial optimization tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23h	Haeyeon Kim, Minsu Kim, Federico Berto, Joungho Kim, Jinkyoo Park
Probabilistic Concept Bottleneck Models	Interpretable models are designed to make decisions in a human-interpretable manner. Representatively, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBM) follow a two-step process of concept prediction and class prediction based on the predicted concepts. CBM provides explanations with high-level concepts derived from concept predictions; thus, reliable concept predictions are important for trustworthiness. In this study, we address the ambiguity issue that can harm reliability. While the existence of a concept can often be ambiguous in the data, CBM predicts concepts deterministically without considering this ambiguity. To provide a reliable interpretation against this ambiguity, we propose Probabilistic Concept Bottleneck Models (ProbCBM). By leveraging probabilistic concept embeddings, ProbCBM models uncertainty in concept prediction and provides explanations based on the concept and its corresponding uncertainty. This uncertainty enhances the reliability of the explanations. Furthermore, as class uncertainty is derived from concept uncertainty in ProbCBM, we can explain class uncertainty by means of concept uncertainty. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/ejkim47/prob-cbm.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23g	Eunji Kim, Dahuin Jung, Sangha Park, Siwon Kim, Sungroh Yoon
Efficient Latency-Aware CNN Depth Compression via Two-Stage Dynamic Programming	Recent works on neural network pruning advocate that reducing the depth of the network is more effective in reducing run-time memory usage and accelerating inference latency than reducing the width of the network through channel pruning. In this regard, some recent works propose depth compression algorithms that merge convolution layers. However, the existing algorithms have a constricted search space and rely on human-engineered heuristics. In this paper, we propose a novel depth compression algorithm which targets general convolution operations. We propose a subset selection problem that replaces inefficient activation layers with identity functions and optimally merges consecutive convolution operations into shallow equivalent convolution operations for efficient end-to-end inference latency. Since the proposed subset selection problem is NP-hard, we formulate a surrogate optimization problem that can be solved exactly via two-stage dynamic programming within a few seconds. We evaluate our methods and baselines by TensorRT for a fair inference latency comparison. Our method outperforms the baseline method with higher accuracy and faster inference speed in MobileNetV2 on the ImageNet dataset. Specifically, we achieve $1.41\times$ speed-up with $0.11$%p accuracy gain in MobileNetV2-1.0 on the ImageNet.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23f	Jinuk Kim, Yeonwoo Jeong, Deokjae Lee, Hyun Oh Song
Improved Algorithms for Multi-period Multi-class Packing Problems with Bandit Feedback	We consider the linear contextual multi-class multi-period packing problem (LMMP) where the goal is to pack items such that the total vector of consumption is below a given budget vector and the total value is as large as possible. We consider the setting where the reward and the consumption vector associated with each action is a class-dependent linear function of the context, and the decision-maker receives bandit feedback. LMMP includes linear contextual bandits with knapsacks and online revenue management as special cases. We establish a new estimator which guarantees a faster convergence rate, and consequently, a lower regret in LMMP. We propose a bandit policy that is a closed-form function of said estimated parameters. When the contexts are non-degenerate, the regret of the proposed policy is sublinear in the context dimension, the number of classes, and the time horizon $T$ when the budget grows at least as $\sqrt{T}$. We also resolve an open problem posed in Agrawal & Devanur (2016) and extend the result to a multi-class setting. Our numerical experiments clearly demonstrate that the performance of our policy is superior to other benchmarks in the literature.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23e	Wonyoung Kim, Garud Iyengar, Assaf Zeevi
Demonstration-free Autonomous Reinforcement Learning via Implicit and Bidirectional Curriculum	While reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved great success in acquiring complex skills solely from environmental interactions, it assumes that resets to the initial state are readily available at the end of each episode. Such an assumption hinders the autonomous learning of embodied agents due to the time-consuming and cumbersome workarounds for resetting in the physical world. Hence, there has been a growing interest in autonomous RL (ARL) methods that are capable of learning from non-episodic interactions. However, existing works on ARL are limited by their reliance on prior data and are unable to learn in environments where task-relevant interactions are sparse. In contrast, we propose a demonstration-free ARL algorithm via Implicit and Bi-directional Curriculum (IBC). With an auxiliary agent that is conditionally activated upon learning progress and a bidirectional goal curriculum based on optimal transport, our method outperforms previous methods, even the ones that leverage demonstrations.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23d	Jigang Kim, Daesol Cho, H.

SAAL: Sharpness-Aware Active Learning	While deep neural networks play significant roles in many research areas, they are also prone to overfitting problems under limited data instances. To overcome overfitting, this paper introduces the first active learning method to incorporate the sharpness of loss space into the acquisition function. Specifically, our proposed method, Sharpness-Aware Active Learning (SAAL), constructs its acquisition function by selecting unlabeled instances whose perturbed loss becomes maximum. Unlike the Sharpness-Aware learning with fully-labeled datasets, we design a pseudo-labeling mechanism to anticipate the perturbed loss w.r.t. the ground-truth label, which we provide the theoretical bound for the optimization. We conduct experiments on various benchmark datasets for vision-based tasks in image classification, object detection, and domain adaptive semantic segmentation. The experimental results confirm that SAAL outperforms the baselines by selecting instances that have the potentially maximal perturbation on the loss. The code is available at https://github.com/YoonyeongKim/SAAL.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23c	Yoon-Yeong Kim, Youngjae Cho, Joonho Jang, Byeonghu Na, Yeongmin Kim, Kyungwoo Song, Wanmo Kang, Il-Chul Moon
Trainability, Expressivity and Interpretability in Gated Neural ODEs	Understanding how the dynamics in biological and artificial neural networks implement the computations required for a task is a salient open question in machine learning and neuroscience. In particular, computations requiring complex memory storage and retrieval pose a significant challenge for these networks to implement or learn. Recently, a family of models described by neural ordinary differential equations (nODEs) has emerged as powerful dynamical neural network models capable of capturing complex dynamics. Here, we extend nODEs by endowing them with adaptive timescales using gating interactions. We refer to these as gated neural ODEs (gnODEs). Using a task that requires memory of continuous quantities, we demonstrate the inductive bias of the gnODEs to learn (approximate) continuous attractors. We further show how reduced-dimensional gnODEs retain their modeling power while greatly improving interpretability, even allowing explicit visualization of the structure of learned attractors. We introduce a novel measure of expressivity which probes the capacity of a neural network to generate complex trajectories. Using this measure, we explore how the phase-space dimension of the nODEs and the complexity of the function modeling the flow field contribute to expressivity. We see that a more complex function for modeling the flow field allows a lower-dimensional nODE to capture a given target dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate the benefit of gating in nODEs on several real-world tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kim23b	Timothy Doyeon Kim, Tankut Can, Kamesh Krishnamurthy
CrossSplit: Mitigating Label Noise Memorization through Data Splitting	We approach the problem of improving robustness of deep learning algorithms in the presence of label noise. Building upon existing label correction and co-teaching methods, we propose a novel training procedure to mitigate the memorization of noisy labels, called CrossSplit, which uses a pair of neural networks trained on two disjoint parts of the labeled dataset. CrossSplit combines two main ingredients: (i) Cross-split label correction. The idea is that, since the model trained on one part of the data cannot memorize example-label pairs from the other part, the training labels presented to each network can be smoothly adjusted by using the predictions of its peer network; (ii) Cross-split semi-supervised training. A network trained on one part of the data also uses the unlabeled inputs of the other part. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet and mini-WebVision datasets demonstrate that our method can outperform the current state-of-the-art in a wide range of noise ratios.

Learning-augmented private algorithms for multiple quantile release	"When applying differential privacy to sensitive data, we can often improve performance using external information such as other sensitive data, public data, or human priors. We propose to use the learning-augmented algorithms (or algorithms with predictions) framework—previously applied largely to improve time complexity or competitive ratios—as a powerful way of designing and analyzing privacy-preserving methods that can take advantage of such external information to improve utility. This idea is instantiated on the important task of multiple quantile release, for which we derive error guarantees that scale with a natural measure of prediction quality while (almost) recovering state-of-the-art prediction-independent guarantees. Our analysis enjoys several advantages, including minimal assumptions about the data, a natural way of adding robustness, and the provision of useful surrogate losses for two novel ""meta"" algorithms that learn predictions from other (potentially sensitive) data. We conclude with experiments on challenging tasks demonstrating that learning predictions across one or more instances can lead to large error reductions while preserving privacy."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/khodak23a	Mikhail Khodak, Kareem Amin, Travis Dick, Sergei Vassilvitskii
Emergent Asymmetry of Precision and Recall for Measuring Fidelity and Diversity of Generative Models in High Dimensions	Precision and Recall are two prominent metrics of generative performance, which were proposed to separately measure the fidelity and diversity of generative models. Given their central role in comparing and improving generative models, understanding their limitations are crucially important. To that end, in this work, we identify a critical flaw in the common approximation of these metrics using k-nearest-neighbors, namely, that the very interpretations of fidelity and diversity that are assigned to Precision and Recall can fail in high dimensions, resulting in very misleading conclusions. Specifically, we empirically and theoretically show that as the number of dimensions grows, two model distributions with supports at equal point-wise distance from the support of the real distribution, can have vastly different Precision and Recall regardless of their respective distributions, hence an emergent asymmetry in high dimensions. Based on our theoretical insights, we then provide simple yet effective modifications to these metrics to construct symmetric metrics regardless of the number of dimensions. Finally, we provide experiments on real-world datasets to illustrate that the identified flaw is not merely a pathological case, and that our proposed metrics are effective in alleviating its impact.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/khayatkhoei23a	Mahyar Khayatkhoei, Wael Abdalmageed
Linearly Constrained Bilevel Optimization: A Smoothed Implicit Gradient Approach	This work develops analysis and algorithms for solving a class of bilevel optimization problems where the lower-level (LL) problems have linear constraints. Most of the existing approaches for constrained bilevel problems rely on value function-based approximate reformulations, which suffer from issues such as non-convex and non-differentiable constraints. In contrast, in this work, we develop an implicit gradient-based approach, which is easy to implement, and is suitable for machine learning applications. We first provide an in-depth understanding of the problem, by showing that the implicit objective for such problems is in general non-differentiable. However, if we add some small (linear) perturbation to the LL objective, the resulting implicit objective becomes differentiable almost surely. This key observation opens the door for developing (deterministic and stochastic) gradient-based algorithms similar to the state-of-the-art ones for unconstrained bi-level problems. We show that when the implicit function is assumed to be strongly-convex, convex, and weakly-convex, the resulting algorithms converge with guaranteed rate. Finally, we experimentally corroborate the theoretical findings and evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on numerical and adversarial learning problems.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/khanduri23a	Prashant Khanduri, Ioannis Tsaknakis, Yihua Zhang, Jia Liu, Sijia Liu, Jiawei Zhang, Mingyi Hong
Loss Balancing for Fair Supervised Learning	Supervised learning models have been used in various domains such as lending, college admission, face recognition, natural language processing, etc. However, they may inherit pre-existing biases from training data and exhibit discrimination against protected social groups. Various fairness notions have been proposed to address unfairness issues. In this work, we focus on Equalized Loss (EL), a fairness notion that requires the expected loss to be (approximately) equalized across different groups. Imposing EL on the learning process leads to a non-convex optimization problem even if the loss function is convex, and the existing fair learning algorithms cannot properly be adopted to find the fair predictor under the EL constraint. This paper introduces an algorithm that can leverage off-the-shelf convex programming tools (e.g., CVXPY (Diamond and Boyd, 2016; Agrawal et al., 2018)) to efficiently find the global optimum of this non-convex optimization. In particular, we propose the ELminimizer algorithm, which finds the optimal fair predictor under EL by reducing the non-convex optimization to a sequence of convex optimization problems. We theoretically prove that our algorithm finds the global optimal solution under certain conditions. Then, we support our theoretical results through several empirical studies	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/khalili23a	Mohammad Mahdi Khalili, Xueru Zhang, Mahed Abroshan
Accelerated Primal-Dual Methods for Convex-Strongly-Concave Saddle Point Problems	We investigate a primal-dual (PD) method for the saddle point problem (SPP) that uses a linear approximation of the primal function instead of the standard proximal step, resulting in a linearized PD (LPD) method. For convex-strongly concave SPP, we observe that the LPD method has a suboptimal dependence on the Lipschitz constant of the primal function. To fix this issue, we combine features of Accelerated Gradient Descent with the LPD method resulting in a single-loop Accelerated Linearized Primal-Dual (ALPD) method. ALPD method achieves the optimal gradient complexity when the SPP has a semi-linear coupling function. We also present an inexact ALPD method for SPPs with a general nonlinear coupling function that maintains the optimal gradient evaluations of the primal parts and significantly improves the gradient evaluations of the coupling term compared to the ALPD method. We verify our findings with numerical experiments.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/khalafi23a	Mohammad Khalafi, Digvijay Boob
PAC Prediction Sets for Large Language Models of Code	Prediction sets have recently been shown to be a promising strategy for quantifying the uncertainty of deep neural networks in a way that provides theoretical guarantees. However, existing techniques have largely targeted settings where the space of labels is simple, so prediction sets can be arbitrary subsets of labels. For structured prediction problems where the space of labels is exponential in size, even prediction sets containing a small fraction of all labels can be exponentially large. In the context of code generation, we propose a solution that considers a restricted set of prediction sets that can compactly be represented as partial programs, which are programs with portions replaced with holes. Given a trained code generation model, our algorithm leverages a programming language's abstract syntax tree to generate a set of programs such that the correct program is in the set with high-confidence. Valuable applications of our algorithm include a Codex-style code generator with holes in uncertain parts of the generated code, which provides a partial program with theoretical guarantees. We evaluate our approach on PICARD (a T5 model for SQL semantic parsing) and Codex (a GPT model for over a dozen programming languages, including Python), demonstrating that our approach generates compact PAC prediction sets. This is the first research contribution that generates PAC prediction sets for generative code models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/khakhar23a	Adam Khakhar, Stephen Mell, Osbert Bastani

Homomorphism AutoEncoder Learning Group Structured Representations from Observed Transitions	How can agents learn internal models that veridically represent interactions with the real world is a largely open question. As machine learning is moving towards representations containing not just observational but also interventional knowledge, we study this problem using tools from representation learning and group theory. We propose methods enabling an agent acting upon the world to learn internal representations of sensory information that are consistent with actions that modify it. We use an autoencoder equipped with a group representation acting on its latent space, trained using an equivariance-derived loss in order to enforce a suitable homomorphism property on the group representation. In contrast to existing work, our approach does not require prior knowledge of the group and does not restrict the set of actions the agent can perform. We motivate our method theoretically, and show empirically that it can learn a group representation of the actions, thereby capturing the structure of the set of transformations applied to the environment. We further show that this allows agents to predict the effect of sequences of future actions with improved accuracy.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/keurti23a	Hamza Keurti, Hsiao-Ru Pan, Michel Besserve, Benjamin F Grewe, Bernhard Schölkopf
Neural Wave Machines: Learning Spatiotemporally Structured Representations with Locally Coupled Oscillatory Recurrent Neural Networks	Traveling waves have been measured at a diversity of regions and scales in the brain, however a consensus as to their computational purpose has yet to be reached. An intriguing hypothesis is that traveling waves serve to structure neural representations both in space and time, thereby acting as an inductive bias towards natural data. In this work, we investigate this hypothesis by introducing the Neural Wave Machine (NWM) – a locally coupled oscillatory recurrent neural network capable of exhibiting traveling waves in its hidden state. After training on simple dynamic sequences, we show that this model indeed learns static spatial structure such as topographic organization, and further uses complex spatiotemporal structure such as traveling waves to encode observed transformations. To measure the computational implications of this structure, we use a suite of sequence classification and physical dynamics modeling tasks to show that the NWM is both more parameter efficient, and is able to forecast future trajectories of simple physical dynamical systems more accurately than existing state of the art counterparts.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/keller23a	T.

Exact Inference in High-order Structured Prediction	In this paper, we study the problem of inference in high-order structured prediction tasks. In the context of Markov random fields, the goal of a high-order inference task is to maximize a score function on the space of labels, and the score function can be decomposed into sum of unary and high-order potentials. We apply a generative model approach to study the problem of high-order inference, and provide a two-stage convex optimization algorithm for exact label recovery. We also provide a new class of hypergraph structural properties related to hyperedge expansion that drives the success in general high-order inference problems. Finally, we connect the performance of our algorithm and the hyperedge expansion property using a novel hypergraph Cheeger-type inequality.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ke23a	Chuyang Ke, Jean Honorio
The Test of Tests: A Framework for Differentially Private Hypothesis Testing	We present a generic framework for creating differentially private versions of any hypothesis test in a black-box way. We analyze the resulting tests analytically and experimentally. Most crucially, we show good practical performance for small data sets, showing that at ε = 1 we only need 5-6 times as much data as in the fully public setting. We compare our work to the one existing framework of this type, as well as to several individually-designed private hypothesis tests. Our framework is higher power than other generic solutions and at least competitive with (and often better than) individually-designed tests.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kazan23a	Zeki Kazan, Kaiyan Shi, Adam Groce, Andrew P Bray
Instrumental Variable Estimation of Average Partial Causal Effects	Instrumental variable (IV) analysis is a powerful tool widely used to elucidate causal relationships. We study the problem of estimating the average partial causal effect (APCE) of a continuous treatment in an IV setting. Specifically, we develop new methods for estimating APCE based on a recent identification condition via an integral equation. We develop two families of methods, nonparametric and parametric - the former uses the Picard iteration to solve the integral equation; the latter parameterizes APCE using a linear basis function model. We analyze the statistical and computational properties of the proposed methods and illustrate them on synthetic and real data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kawakami23a	Yuta Kawakami, Manabu Kuroki, Jin Tian
How Does Information Bottleneck Help Deep Learning?	Numerous deep learning algorithms have been inspired by and understood via the notion of information bottleneck, where unnecessary information is (often implicitly) minimized while task-relevant information is maximized. However, a rigorous argument for justifying why it is desirable to control information bottlenecks has been elusive. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous learning theory for justifying the benefit of information bottleneck in deep learning by mathematically relating information bottleneck to generalization errors. Our theory proves that controlling information bottleneck is one way to control generalization errors in deep learning, although it is not the only or necessary way. We investigate the merit of our new mathematical findings with experiments across a range of architectures and learning settings. In many cases, generalization errors are shown to correlate with the degree of information bottleneck: i.e., the amount of the unnecessary information at hidden layers. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for current and future methods through the lens of information bottleneck. Our new generalization bounds scale with the degree of information bottleneck, unlike the previous bounds that scale with the number of parameters, VC dimension, Rademacher complexity, stability or robustness.

Curious Replay for Model-based Adaptation	Agents must be able to adapt quickly as an environment changes. We find that existing model-based reinforcement learning agents are unable to do this well, in part because of how they use past experiences to train their world model. Here, we present Curious Replay—a form of prioritized experience replay tailored to model-based agents through use of a curiosity-based priority signal. Agents using Curious Replay exhibit improved performance in an exploration paradigm inspired by animal behavior and on the Crafter benchmark. DreamerV3 with Curious Replay surpasses state-of-the-art performance on Crafter, achieving a mean score of 19.4 that substantially improves on the previous high score of 14.5 by DreamerV3 with uniform replay, while also maintaining similar performance on the Deepmind Control Suite.

Learning Mixtures of Markov Chains and MDPs	"We present an algorithm for learning mixtures of Markov chains and Markov decision processes (MDPs) from short unlabeled trajectories. Specifically, our method handles mixtures of Markov chains with optional control input by going through a multi-step process, involving (1) a subspace estimation step, (2) spectral clustering of trajectories using ""pairwise distance estimators,"" along with refinement using the EM algorithm, (3) a model estimation step, and (4) a classification step for predicting labels of new trajectories. We provide end-to-end performance guarantees, where we only explicitly require the length of trajectories to be linear in the number of states and the number of trajectories to be linear in a mixing time parameter. Experimental results support these guarantees, where we attain 96.6% average accuracy on a mixture of two MDPs in gridworld, outperforming the EM algorithm with random initialization (73.2% average accuracy). We also significantly outperform the EM algorithm on real data from the LastFM song dataset."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kausik23a	Chinmaya Kausik, Kevin Tan, Ambuj Tewari
Multi-Modal Classifiers for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection	The goal of this paper is open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) — building a model that can detect objects beyond the set of categories seen at training, thus enabling the user to specify categories of interest at inference without the need for model retraining. We adopt a standard two- stage object detector architecture, and explore three ways for specifying novel categories: via language descriptions, via image exemplars, or via a combination of the two. We make three contributions: first, we prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate informative language descriptions for object classes, and construct powerful text-based classifiers; second, we employ a visual aggregator on image exemplars that can ingest any number of images as input, forming vision-based classifiers; and third, we provide a simple method to fuse information from language descriptions and image exemplars, yield- ing a multi-modal classifier. When evaluating on the challenging LVIS open-vocabulary bench- mark we demonstrate that: (i) our text-based classifiers outperform all previous OVOD works; (ii) our vision-based classifiers perform as well as text-based classifiers in prior work; (iii) using multi-modal classifiers perform better than either modality alone; and finally, (iv) our text-based and multi-modal classifiers yield better performance than a fully-supervised detector.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kaul23a	Prannay Kaul, Weidi Xie, Andrew Zisserman
Data Representations’ Study of Latent Image Manifolds	Deep neural networks have been demonstrated to achieve phenomenal success in many domains, and yet their inner mechanisms are not well understood. In this paper, we investigate the curvature of image manifolds, i.e., the manifold deviation from being flat in its principal directions. We find that state-of-the-art trained convolutional neural networks for image classification have a characteristic curvature profile along layers: an initial steep increase, followed by a long phase of a plateau, and followed by another increase. In contrast, this behavior does not appear in untrained networks in which the curvature flattens. We also show that the curvature gap between the last two layers has a strong correlation with the generalization capability of the network. Moreover, we find that the intrinsic dimension of latent codes is not necessarily indicative of curvature. Finally, we observe that common regularization methods such as mixup yield flatter representations when compared to other methods. Our experiments show consistent results over a variety of deep learning architectures and multiple data sets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kaufman23a	Ilya Kaufman, Omri Azencot
Regression with Sensor Data Containing Incomplete Observations	This paper addresses a regression problem in which output label values are the results of sensing the magnitude of a phenomenon. A low value of such labels can mean either that the actual magnitude of the phenomenon was low or that the sensor made an incomplete observation. This leads to a bias toward lower values in labels and the resultant learning because labels may have lower values due to incomplete observations, even if the actual magnitude of the phenomenon was high. Moreover, because an incomplete observation does not provide any tags indicating incompleteness, we cannot eliminate or impute them. To address this issue, we propose a learning algorithm that explicitly models incomplete observations corrupted with an asymmetric noise that always has a negative value. We show that our algorithm is unbiased as if it were learned from uncorrupted data that does not involve incomplete observations. We demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm through numerical experiments.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/katsuki23a	Takayuki Katsuki, Takayuki Osogami
General Sequential Episodic Memory Model	The state-of-the-art memory model is the General Associative Memory Model, a generalization of the classical Hopfield network. Like its ancestor, the general associative memory has a well-defined state-dependant energy surface, and its memories correlate with its fixed points. This is unlike human memories, which are commonly sequential rather than separated fixed points. In this paper, we introduce a class of General Sequential Episodic Memory Models (GSEMM) that, in the adiabatic limit, exhibit a dynamic energy surface, leading to a series of meta-stable states capable of encoding memory sequences. A multiple-timescale architecture enables the dynamic nature of the energy surface with newly introduced asymmetric synapses and signal propagation delays. We demonstrate its dense capacity under polynomial activation functions. GSEMM combines separate memories, short and long sequential episodic memories, under a unified theoretical framework, demonstrating how energy-based memory modeling can provide richer, human-like episodes.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/karuvally23a	Arjun Karuvally, Terrence Sejnowski, Hava T Siegelmann
Cocktail Party Attack: Breaking Aggregation-Based Privacy in Federated Learning Using Independent Component Analysis	Federated learning (FL) aims to perform privacy-preserving machine learning on distributed data held by multiple data owners. To this end, FL requires the data owners to perform training locally and share the gradients or weight updates (instead of the private inputs) with the central server, which are then securely aggregated over multiple data owners. Although aggregation by itself does not offer provable privacy protection, prior work suggested that if the batch size is sufficiently large the aggregation may be secure enough. In this paper, we propose the Cocktail Party Attack (CPA) that, contrary to prior belief, is able to recover the private inputs from gradients/weight updates aggregated over as many as 1024 samples. CPA leverages the crucial insight that aggregate gradients from a fully connected (FC) layer is a linear combination of its inputs, which allows us to frame gradient inversion as a blind source separation (BSS) problem. We adapt independent component analysis (ICA)—a classic solution to the BSS problem—to recover private inputs for FC and convolutional networks, and show that CPA significantly outperforms prior gradient inversion attacks, scales to ImageNet-sized inputs, and works on large batch sizes of up to 1024.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kariyappa23a	Sanjay Kariyappa, Chuan Guo, Kiwan Maeng, Wenjie Xiong, G.

On the Relationship Between Explanation and Prediction: A Causal View	Being able to provide explanations for a model's decision has become a central requirement for the development, deployment, and adoption of machine learning models. However, we are yet to understand what explanation methods can and cannot do. How do upstream factors such as data, model prediction, hyperparameters, and random initialization influence downstream explanations? While previous work raised concerns that explanations (E) may have little relationship with the prediction (Y), there is a lack of conclusive study to quantify this relationship. Our work borrows tools from causal inference to systematically assay this relationship. More specifically, we study the relationship between E and Y by measuring the treatment effect when intervening on their causal ancestors, i.e., on hyperparameters and inputs used to generate saliency-based Es or Ys. Our results suggest that the relationships between E and Y is far from ideal. In fact, the gap between 'ideal' case only increase in higher-performing models — models that are likely to be deployed. Our work is a promising first step towards providing a quantitative measure of the relationship between E and Y, which could also inform the future development of methods for E with a quantitative metric.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/karimi23a	Amir-Hossein Karimi, Krikamol Muandet, Simon Kornblith, Bernhard Schölkopf, Been Kim
Langevin Thompson Sampling with Logarithmic Communication: Bandits and Reinforcement Learning	Thompson sampling (TS) is widely used in sequential decision making due to its ease of use and appealing empirical performance. However, many existing analytical and empirical results for TS rely on restrictive assumptions on reward distributions, such as belonging to conjugate families, which limits their applicability in realistic scenarios. Moreover, sequential decision making problems are often carried out in a batched manner, either due to the inherent nature of the problem or to serve the purpose of reducing communication and computation costs. In this work, we jointly study these problems in two popular settings, namely, stochastic multi-armed bandits (MABs) and infinite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL), where TS is used to learn the unknown reward distributions and transition dynamics, respectively. We propose batched	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/karbasi23a	Amin Karbasi, Nikki Lijing Kuang, Yian Ma, Siddharth Mitra
Understanding Gradient Regularization in Deep Learning: Efficient Finite-Difference Computation and Implicit Bias	Gradient regularization (GR) is a method that penalizes the gradient norm of the training loss during training. While some studies have reported that GR can improve generalization performance, little attention has been paid to it from the algorithmic perspective, that is, the algorithms of GR that efficiently improve the performance. In this study, we first reveal that a specific finite-difference computation, composed of both gradient ascent and descent steps, reduces the computational cost of GR. Next, we show that the finite-difference computation also works better in the sense of generalization performance. We theoretically analyze a solvable model, a diagonal linear network, and clarify that GR has a desirable implicit bias to so-called rich regime and finite-difference computation strengthens this bias. Furthermore, finite-difference GR is closely related to some other algorithms based on iterative ascent and descent steps for exploring flat minima. In particular, we reveal that the flooding method can perform finite-difference GR in an implicit way.

Node Embedding from Neural Hamiltonian Orbits in Graph Neural Networks	In the graph node embedding problem, embedding spaces can vary significantly for different data types, leading to the need for different GNN model types. In this paper, we model the embedding update of a node feature as a Hamiltonian orbit over time. Since the Hamiltonian orbits generalize the exponential maps, this approach allows us to learn the underlying manifold of the graph in training, in contrast to most of the existing literature that assumes a fixed graph embedding manifold with a closed exponential map solution. Our proposed node embedding strategy can automatically learn, without extensive tuning, the underlying geometry of any given graph dataset even if it has diverse geometries. We test Hamiltonian functions of different forms and verify the performance of our approach on two graph node embedding downstream tasks: node classification and link prediction. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach adapts better to different types of graph datasets than popular state-of-the-art graph node embedding GNNs. The code is available at https://github.com/zknus/Hamiltonian-GNN.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kang23d	Qiyu Kang, Kai Zhao, Yang Song, Sijie Wang, Wee Peng Tay
Poisoning Generative Replay in Continual Learning to Promote Forgetting	Generative models have grown into the workhorse of many state-of-the-art machine learning methods. However, their vulnerability under poisoning attacks has been largely understudied. In this work, we investigate this issue in the context of continual learning, where generative replayers are utilized to tackle catastrophic forgetting. By developing a novel customization of dirty-label input-aware backdoors to the online setting, our attacker manages to stealthily promote forgetting while retaining high accuracy at the current task and sustaining strong defenders. Our approach taps into an intriguing property of generative models, namely that they cannot well capture input-dependent triggers. Experiments on four standard datasets corroborate the poisoner's effectiveness.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kang23c	Siteng Kang, Zhan Shi, Xinhua Zhang
Beyond Reward: Offline Preference-guided Policy Optimization	This study focuses on the topic of offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), a variant of conventional reinforcement learning that dispenses with the need for online interaction or specification of reward functions. Instead, the agent is provided with fixed offline trajectories and human preferences between pairs of trajectories to extract the dynamics and task information, respectively. Since the dynamics and task information are orthogonal, a naive approach would involve using preference-based reward learning followed by an off-the-shelf offline RL algorithm. However, this requires the separate learning of a scalar reward function, which is assumed to be an information bottleneck of the learning process. To address this issue, we propose the offline preference-guided policy optimization (OPPO) paradigm, which models offline trajectories and preferences in a one-step process, eliminating the need for separately learning a reward function. OPPO achieves this by introducing an offline hindsight information matching objective for optimizing a contextual policy and a preference modeling objective for finding the optimal context. OPPO further integrates a well-performing decision policy by optimizing the two objectives iteratively. Our empirical results demonstrate that OPPO effectively models offline preferences and outperforms prior competing baselines, including offline RL algorithms performed over either true or pseudo reward function specifications. Our code is available on the project website: https://sites.google.com/view/oppo-icml-2023.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kang23b	Yachen Kang, Diyuan Shi, Jinxin Liu, Li He, Donglin Wang
Leveraging Proxy of Training Data for Test-Time Adaptation	We consider test-time adaptation (TTA), the task of adapting a trained model to an arbitrary test domain using unlabeled input data on-the-fly during testing. A common practice of TTA is to disregard data used in training due to large memory demand and privacy leakage. However, the training data are the only source of supervision. This motivates us to investigate a proper way of using them while minimizing the side effects. To this end, we propose two lightweight yet informative proxies of the training data and a TTA method fully exploiting them. One of the proxies is composed of a small number of images synthesized (hence, less privacy-sensitive) by data condensation which minimizes their domain-specificity to capture a general underlying structure over a wide spectrum of domains. Then, in TTA, they are translated into labeled test data by stylizing them to match styles of unlabeled test samples. This enables virtually supervised test-time training. The other proxy is inter-class relations of training data, which are transferred to target model during TTA. On four public benchmarks, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art ones at remarkably less computation and memory.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kang23a	Juwon Kang, Nayeong Kim, Donghyeon Kwon, Jungseul Ok, Suha Kwak
A Deep Conjugate Direction Method for Iteratively Solving Linear Systems	We present a novel deep learning approach to approximate the solution of large, sparse, symmetric, positive-definite linear systems of equations. Motivated by the conjugate gradients algorithm that iteratively selects search directions for minimizing the matrix norm of the approximation error, we design an approach that utilizes a deep neural network to accelerate convergence via data-driven improvement of the search direction at each iteration. Our method leverages a carefully chosen convolutional network to approximate the action of the inverse of the linear operator up to an arbitrary constant. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on spatially discretized Poisson equations, which arise in computational fluid dynamics applications, with millions of degrees of freedom. Unlike state-of-the-art learning approaches, our algorithm is capable of reducing the linear system residual to a given tolerance in a small number of iterations, independent of the problem size. Moreover, our method generalizes effectively to various systems beyond those encountered during training.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kaneda23a	Ayano Kaneda, Osman Akar, Jingyu Chen, Victoria Alicia Trevino Kala, David Hyde, Joseph Teran
Git-Theta: A Git Extension for Collaborative Development of Machine Learning Models	Currently, most machine learning models are trained by centralized teams and are rarely updated. In contrast, open-source software development involves the iterative development of a shared artifact through distributed collaboration using a version control system. In the interest of enabling collaborative and continual improvement of machine learning models (Raffel, 2023), we introduce Git-Theta, a version control system for machine learning models. Git-Theta is an extension to Git, the most widely used version control software, that allows fine-grained tracking of changes to model parameters alongside code and other artifacts. Unlike existing version control systems that treat a model checkpoint as a blob of data, Git-Theta leverages the structure of checkpoints to support communication-efficient updates, automatic model merges, and meaningful reporting about the difference between two versions of a model. In addition, Git-Theta includes a plug-in system that enables users to easily add support for new functionality. In this paper, we introduce Git-Theta's design and features and include an example use-case of Git-Theta where a pre-trained model is continually adapted and modified. We publicly release Git-Theta in hopes of kickstarting a new era of collaborative model development. https://github.com/r-three/git-theta/	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kandpal23b	Nikhil Kandpal, Brian Lester, Mohammed Muqeeth, Anisha Mascarenhas, Monty Evans, Vishal Baskaran, Tenghao Huang, Haokun Liu, Colin Raffel
Large Language Models Struggle to Learn Long-Tail Knowledge	The Internet contains a wealth of knowledge—from the birthdays of historical figures to tutorials on how to code—all of which may be learned by language models. However, while certain pieces of information are ubiquitous on the web, others appear extremely rarely. In this paper, we study the relationship between the knowledge memorized by large language models and the information in pre-training datasets scraped from the web. In particular, we show that a language model's ability to answer a fact-based question relates to how many documents associated with that question were seen during pre-training. We identify these relevant documents by entity linking pre-training datasets and counting documents that contain the same entities as a given question-answer pair. Our results demonstrate strong correlational and causal relationships between accuracy and relevant document count for numerous question answering datasets (e.g., TriviaQA), pre-training corpora (e.g., ROOTS), and model sizes (e.g., 176B parameters). Moreover, while larger models are better at learning long-tail knowledge, we estimate that today's models must be scaled by many orders of magnitude to reach competitive QA performance on questions with little support in the pre-training data. Finally, we show that retrieval-augmentation can reduce the dependence on relevant pre-training information, presenting a promising approach for capturing the long-tail.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kandpal23a	Nikhil Kandpal, Haikang Deng, Adam Roberts, Eric Wallace, Colin Raffel
One-vs-the-Rest Loss to Focus on Important Samples in Adversarial Training	This paper proposes a new loss function for adversarial training. Since adversarial training has difficulties, e.g., necessity of high model capacity, focusing on important data points by weighting cross-entropy loss has attracted much attention. However, they are vulnerable to sophisticated attacks, e.g., Auto-Attack. This paper experimentally reveals that the cause of their vulnerability is their small margins between logits for the true label and the other labels. Since neural networks classify the data points based on the logits, logit margins should be large enough to avoid flipping the largest logit by the attacks. Importance-aware methods do not increase logit margins of important samples but decrease those of less-important samples compared with cross-entropy loss. To increase logit margins of important samples, we propose switching one-vs-the-rest loss (SOVR), which switches from cross-entropy to one-vs-the-rest loss for important samples that have small logit margins. We prove that one-vs-the-rest loss increases logit margins two times larger than the weighted cross-entropy loss for a simple problem. We experimentally confirm that SOVR increases logit margins of important samples unlike existing methods and achieves better robustness against Auto-Attack than importance-aware methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kanai23a	Sekitoshi Kanai, Shin’Ya Yamaguchi, Masanori Yamada, Hiroshi Takahashi, Kentaro Ohno, Yasutoshi Ida
Deep Generative Symbolic Regression with Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search	Symbolic regression (SR) is the problem of learning a symbolic expression from numerical data. Recently, deep neural models trained on procedurally-generated synthetic datasets showed competitive performance compared to more classical Genetic Programming (GP) ones. Unlike their GP counterparts, these neural approaches are trained to generate expressions from datasets given as context. This allows them to produce accurate expressions in a single forward pass at test time. However, they usually do not benefit from search abilities, which result in low performance compared to GP on out-of-distribution datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel method which provides the best of both worlds, based on a Monte-Carlo Tree Search procedure using a context-aware neural mutation model, which is initially pre-trained to learn promising mutations, and further refined from successful experiences in an online fashion. The approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the well-known SRBench benchmark.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kamienny23a	Pierre-Alexandre Kamienny, Guillaume Lample, Sylvain Lamprier, Marco Virgolin

Identifying Interpretable Subspaces in Image Representations	We propose Automatic Feature Explanation using Contrasting Concepts (FALCON), an interpretability framework to explain features of image representations. For a target feature, FALCON captions its highly activating cropped images using a large captioning dataset (like LAION-400m) and a pre-trained vision-language model like CLIP. Each word among the captions is scored and ranked leading to a small number of shared, human-understandable concepts that closely describe the target feature. FALCON also applies contrastive interpretation using lowly activating (counterfactual) images, to eliminate spurious concepts. Although many existing approaches interpret features independently, we observe in state-of-the-art self-supervised and supervised models, that less than 20% of the representation space can be explained by individual features. We show that features in larger spaces become more interpretable when studied in groups and can be explained with high-order scoring concepts through FALCON. We discuss how extracted concepts can be used to explain and debug failures in downstream tasks. Finally, we present a technique to transfer concepts from one (explainable) representation space to another unseen representation space by learning a simple linear transformation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kalibhat23a	Neha Kalibhat, Shweta Bhardwaj, C.

Statistical Indistinguishability of Learning Algorithms	When two different parties use the same learning rule on their own data, how can we test whether the distributions of the two outcomes are similar? In this paper, we study the similarity of outcomes of learning rules through the lens of the Total Variation (TV) distance of distributions. We say that a learning rule is TV indistinguishable if the expected TV distance between the posterior distributions of its outputs, executed on two training data sets drawn independently from the same distribution, is small. We first investigate the learnability of hypothesis classes using TV indistinguishable learners. Our main results are information-theoretic equivalences between TV indistinguishability and existing algorithmic stability notions such as replicability and approximate differential privacy. Then, we provide statistical amplification and boosting algorithms for TV indistinguishable learners.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kalavasis23a	Alkis Kalavasis, Amin Karbasi, Shay Moran, Grigoris Velegkas
Biases in Evaluation of Molecular Optimization Methods and Bias Reduction Strategies	We are interested in an evaluation methodology for molecular optimization. Given a sample of molecules and their properties of our interest, we wish not only to train a generator of molecules optimized with respect to a target property but also to evaluate its performance accurately. A common practice is to train a predictor of the target property using the sample and apply it to both training and evaluating the generator. However, little is known about its statistical properties, and thus, we are not certain about whether this performance estimate is reliable or not. We theoretically investigate this evaluation methodology and show that it potentially suffers from two biases; one is due to misspecification of the predictor and the other to reusing the same finite sample for training and evaluation. We discuss bias reduction methods for each of the biases, and empirically investigate their effectiveness.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kajino23a	Hiroshi Kajino, Kohei Miyaguchi, Takayuki Osogami
Equivariance with Learned Canonicalization Functions	Symmetry-based neural networks often constrain the architecture in order to achieve invariance or equivariance to a group of transformations. In this paper, we propose an alternative that avoids this architectural constraint by learning to produce canonical representations of the data. These canonicalization functions can readily be plugged into non-equivariant backbone architectures. We offer explicit ways to implement them for some groups of interest. We show that this approach enjoys universality while providing interpretable insights. Our main hypothesis, supported by our empirical results, is that learning a small neural network to perform canonicalization is better than using predefined heuristics. Our experiments show that learning the canonicalization function is competitive with existing techniques for learning equivariant functions across many tasks, including image classification, $N$-body dynamics prediction, point cloud classification and part segmentation, while being faster across the board.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/kaba23a	Sékou-Oumar Kaba, Arnab Kumar Mondal, Yan Zhang, Yoshua Bengio, Siamak Ravanbakhsh
The Catalog Problem: Clustering and Ordering Variable-Sized Sets	Prediction of a $\textbf{varying number}$ of $\textbf{ordered clusters}$ from sets of $\textbf{any cardinality}$ is a challenging task for neural networks, combining elements of set representation, clustering and learning to order. This task arises in many diverse areas, ranging from medical triage and early discharge, through machine part management and multi-channel signal analysis for petroleum exploration to product catalog structure prediction. This paper focuses on that last area, which exemplifies a number of challenges inherent to adaptive ordered clustering, referred to further as the eponymous $\textit{Catalog Problem}$. These include learning variable cluster constraints, exhibiting relational reasoning and managing combinatorial complexity. Despite progress in both neural clustering and set-to-sequence methods, no joint, fully differentiable model exists to-date. We develop such a modular architecture, referred to further as Neural Ordered Clusters (NOC), enhance it with a specific mechanism for learning cluster-level cardinality constraints, and provide a robust comparison of its performance in relation to alternative models. We test our method on three datasets, including synthetic catalog structures and PROCAT, a dataset of real-world catalogs consisting of over 1.5M products, achieving state-of-the-art results on a new, more challenging formulation of the underlying problem, which has not been addressed before. Additionally, we examine the network's ability to learn higher-order interactions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jurewicz23a	Mateusz Maria Jurewicz, Graham W. Taylor, Leon Derczynski
Estimating Joint Treatment Effects by Combining Multiple Experiments	Estimating the effects of multi-dimensional treatments (i.e., joint treatment effects) is critical in many data-intensive domains, including genetics and drug evaluation. The main challenges for studying the joint treatment effects include the need for large sample sizes to explore different treatment combinations as well as potentially unsafe treatment interactions. In this paper, we develop machinery for estimating joint treatment effects by combining data from multiple experimental datasets. In particular, first, we develop new identification conditions for determining whether a joint treatment effect can be computed in terms of multiple interventional distributions under various scenarios. Further, we develop estimators with statistically appealing properties, including consistency and robustness to model misspecification and slow convergence. Finally, we perform simulation studies, which corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jung23c	Yonghan Jung, Jin Tian, Elias Bareinboim
Fighting Fire with Fire: Contrastive Debiasing without Bias-free Data via Generative Bias-transformation	Deep neural networks (DNNs), despite their ability to generalize with over-capacity networks, often rely heavily on the malignant bias as shortcuts instead of task-related information for discriminative tasks. This can lead to poor performance on real-world inputs, particularly when the majority of the sample is biased. To address the highly biased issue, recent studies either exploit auxiliary information which is rarely obtainable in practice or sift handful bias-free samples to emphasize them for debiasing. However, these methods are not always guaranteed to work due to unmet presumptions. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Debiasing via Generative Bias-transformation (CDvG) which is capable of operating without explicitly exploiting bias labels and bias-free samples. Motivated by our observation that not only discriminative models but also image translation models tend to focus on the malignant bias, CDvG employs an image translation model to transform the bias to another mode of bias while preserving task-relevant information. Through contrastive learning, the bias-transformed views are set against each other to learn bias-invariant representations. Our method shows a better debiasing effect when bias is more malignant as opposed to previous methods, and can also be integrated with the methods that focus on bias-free samples in a plug-and-play manner for further improvement. Experimental results on diverse datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art, especially when bias-free samples are extremely scarce or absent.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jung23b	Yeonsung Jung, Hajin Shim, June Yong Yang, Eunho Yang
Scaling of Class-wise Training Losses for Post-hoc Calibration	The class-wise training losses often diverge as a result of the various levels of intra-class and inter-class appearance variation, and we find that the diverging class-wise training losses cause the uncalibrated prediction with its reliability. To resolve the issue, we propose a new calibration method to synchronize the class-wise training losses. We design a new training loss to alleviate the variance of class-wise training losses by using multiple class-wise scaling factors. Since our framework can compensate the training losses of overfitted classes with those of under-fitted classes, the integrated training loss is preserved, preventing the performance drop even after the model calibration. Furthermore, our method can be easily employed in the post-hoc calibration methods, allowing us to use the pre-trained model as an initial model and reduce the additional computation for model calibration. We validate the proposed framework by employing it in the various post-hoc calibration methods, which generally improves calibration performance while preserving accuracy, and discover through the investigation that our approach performs well with unbalanced datasets and untuned hyperparameters.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jung23a	Seungjin Jung, Seungmo Seo, Yonghyun Jeong, Jongwon Choi
FARE: Provably Fair Representation Learning with Practical Certificates	Fair representation learning (FRL) is a popular class of methods aiming to produce fair classifiers via data preprocessing. Recent regulatory directives stress the need for FRL methods that provide practical certificates, i.e., provable upper bounds on the unfairness of any downstream classifier trained on preprocessed data, which directly provides assurance in a practical scenario. Creating such FRL methods is an important challenge that remains unsolved. In this work, we address that challenge and introduce FARE (Fairness with Restricted Encoders), the first FRL method with practical fairness certificates. FARE is based on our key insight that restricting the representation space of the encoder enables the derivation of practical guarantees, while still permitting favorable accuracy-fairness tradeoffs for suitable instantiations, such as one we propose based on fair trees. To produce a practical certificate, we develop and apply a statistical procedure that computes a finite sample high-confidence upper bound on the unfairness of any downstream classifier trained on FARE embeddings. In our comprehensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that FARE produces practical certificates that are tight and often even comparable with purely empirical results obtained by prior methods, which establishes the practical value of our approach.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jovanovic23a	Nikola Jovanović, Mislav Balunovic, Dimitar Iliev Dimitrov, Martin Vechev
On Bridging the Gap between Mean Field and Finite Width Deep Random Multilayer Perceptron with Batch Normalization	Mean-field theory is widely used in theoretical studies of neural networks. In this paper, we analyze the role of depth in the concentration of mean-field predictions for Gram matrices of hidden representations in deep multilayer perceptron (MLP) with batch normalization (BN) at initialization. It is postulated that the mean-field predictions suffer from layer-wise errors that amplify with depth. We demonstrate that BN avoids this error amplification with depth. When the chain of hidden representations is rapidly mixing, we establish a concentration bound for a mean-field model of Gram matrices. To our knowledge, this is the first concentration bound that does not become vacuous with depth for standard MLPs with a finite width.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/joudaki23a	Amir Joudaki, Hadi Daneshmand, Francis Bach
Robust Subtask Learning for Compositional Generalization	Compositional reinforcement learning is a promising approach for training policies to perform complex long-horizon tasks. Typically, a high-level task is decomposed into a sequence of subtasks and a separate policy is trained to perform each subtask. In this paper, we focus on the problem of training subtask policies in a way that they can be used to perform any task; here, a task is given by a sequence of subtasks. We aim to maximize the worst-case performance over all tasks as opposed to the average-case performance. We formulate the problem as a two agent zero-sum game in which the adversary picks the sequence of subtasks. We propose two RL algorithms to solve this game: one is an adaptation of existing multi-agent RL algorithms to our setting and the other is an asynchronous version which enables parallel training of subtask policies. We evaluate our approach on two multi-task environments with continuous states and actions and demonstrate that our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art baselines.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jothimurugan23a	Kishor Jothimurugan, Steve Hsu, Osbert Bastani, Rajeev Alur
Data-Efficient Contrastive Self-supervised Learning: Most Beneficial Examples for Supervised Learning Contribute the Least	Self-supervised learning (SSL) learns high-quality representations from large pools of unlabeled training data. As datasets grow larger, it becomes crucial to identify the examples that contribute the most to learning such representations. This enables efficient SSL by reducing the volume of data required. Nevertheless, quantifying the value of examples for SSL has remained an open question. In this work, we address this problem for the first time, by proving that examples that contribute the most to contrastive SSL are those that have the most similar augmentations to other examples, in expectation. We provide rigorous guarantees for the generalization performance of contrastive learning on such subsets. Through extensive experiments, we show that we can safely exclude 20% of examples from CIFAR100 and 40% from STL10 and TinyImageNet, without affecting downstream task performance. In general, subsets selected by our method outperform random subsets by over 3% across these datasets. Interestingly, we also discover the subsets that contribute the most to contrastive learning are those that contribute the least to supervised learning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/joshi23b	Siddharth Joshi, Baharan Mirzasoleiman
On the Expressive Power of Geometric Graph Neural Networks	The expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been studied extensively through the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) graph isomorphism test. However, standard GNNs and the WL framework are inapplicable for geometric graphs embedded in Euclidean space, such as biomolecules, materials, and other physical systems. In this work, we propose a geometric version of the WL test (GWL) for discriminating geometric graphs while respecting the underlying physical symmetries: permutations, rotation, reflection, and translation. We use GWL to characterise the expressive power of geometric GNNs that are invariant or equivariant to physical symmetries in terms of distinguishing geometric graphs. GWL unpacks how key design choices influence geometric GNN expressivity: (1) Invariant layers have limited expressivity as they cannot distinguish one-hop identical geometric graphs; (2) Equivariant layers distinguish a larger class of graphs by propagating geometric information beyond local neighbourhoods; (3) Higher order tensors and scalarisation enable maximally powerful geometric GNNs; and (4) GWL's discrimination-based perspective is equivalent to universal approximation.

Automatically Auditing Large Language Models via Discrete Optimization	"Auditing large language models for unexpected behaviors is critical to preempt catastrophic deployments, yet remains challenging. In this work, we cast auditing as an optimization problem, where we automatically search for input-output pairs that match a desired target behavior. For example, we might aim to find a non-toxic input that starts with ""Barack Obama"" that a model maps to a toxic output. This optimization problem is difficult to solve as the set of feasible points is sparse, the space is discrete, and the language models we audit are non-linear and high-dimensional. To combat these challenges, we introduce a discrete optimization algorithm, ARCA, that jointly and efficiently optimizes over inputs and outputs. Our approach automatically uncovers derogatory completions about celebrities (e.g. ""Barack Obama is a legalized unborn"" –$>$ ""child murderer""), produces French inputs that complete to English outputs, and finds inputs that generate a specific name. Our work offers a promising new tool to uncover models' failure-modes before deployment.

Thompson Sampling with Less Exploration is Fast and Optimal	We propose $\epsilon$-Exploring Thompson Sampling ($\epsilon$-TS), a modified version of the Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm for multi-armed bandits. In $\epsilon$-TS, arms are selected greedily based on empirical mean rewards with probability $1-\epsilon$, and based on posterior samples obtained from TS with probability $\epsilon$. Here, $\epsilon\in(0,1)$ is a user-defined constant. By reducing exploration, $\epsilon$-TS improves computational efficiency compared to TS while achieving better regret bounds. We establish that $\epsilon$-TS is both minimax optimal and asymptotically optimal for various popular reward distributions, including Gaussian, Bernoulli, Poisson, and Gamma. A key technical advancement in our analysis is the relaxation of the requirement for a stringent anti-concentration bound of the posterior distribution, which was necessary in recent analyses that achieved similar bounds. As a result, $\epsilon$-TS maintains the posterior update structure of TS while minimizing alterations, such as clipping the sampling distribution or solving the inverse of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between reward distributions, as done in previous work. Furthermore, our algorithm is as easy to implement as TS, but operates significantly faster due to reduced exploration. Empirical evaluations confirm the efficiency and optimality of $\epsilon$-TS.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jin23b	Tianyuan Jin, Xianglin Yang, Xiaokui Xiao, Pan Xu
Understanding Incremental Learning of Gradient Descent: A Fine-grained Analysis of Matrix Sensing	It is believed that Gradient Descent (GD) induces an implicit bias towards good generalization in training machine learning models. This paper provides a fine-grained analysis of the dynamics of GD for the matrix sensing problem, whose goal is to recover a low-rank ground-truth matrix from near-isotropic linear measurements. It is shown that GD with small initialization behaves similarly to the greedy low-rank learning heuristics and follows an incremental learning procedure: GD sequentially learns solutions with increasing ranks until it recovers the ground truth matrix. Compared to existing works which only analyze the first learning phase for rank-1 solutions, our result provides characterizations for the whole learning process. Moreover, besides the over-parameterized regime that many prior works focused on, our analysis of the incremental learning procedure also applies to the	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jin23a	Jikai Jin, Zhiyuan Li, Kaifeng Lyu, Simon Shaolei Du, Jason D.

Effective Structured Prompting by Meta-Learning and Representative Verbalizer	Prompt tuning for pre-trained masked language models (MLM) has shown promising performance in natural language processing tasks with few labeled examples. It tunes a prompt for the downstream task, and a verbalizer is used to bridge the predicted token and label prediction. Due to the limited training data, prompt initialization is crucial for prompt tuning. Recently, MetaPrompting (Hou et al., 2022) uses meta-learning to learn a shared initialization for all task-specific prompts. However, a single initialization is insufficient to obtain good prompts for all tasks and samples when the tasks are complex. Moreover, MetaPrompting requires tuning the whole MLM, causing a heavy burden on computation and memory as the MLM is usually large. To address these issues, we use a prompt pool to extract more task knowledge and construct instance-dependent prompts via attention. We further propose a novel soft verbalizer (RepVerb) which constructs label embedding from feature embeddings directly. Combining meta-learning the prompt pool and RepVerb, we propose MetaPrompter for effective structured prompting. MetaPrompter is parameter-efficient as only the pool is required to be tuned. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaPrompter performs better than the recent state-of-the-arts and RepVerb outperforms existing soft verbalizers.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jiang23k	Weisen Jiang, Yu Zhang, James Kwok
NeuralSlice: Neural 3D Triangle Mesh Reconstruction via Slicing 4D Tetrahedral Meshes	Learning-based high-fidelity reconstruction of 3D shapes with varying topology is a fundamental problem in computer vision and computer graphics. Recent advances in learning 3D shapes using explicit and implicit representations have achieved impressive results in 3D modeling. However, the template-based explicit representation is limited by fixed topology, and the implicit representation, although flexible with arbitrary topology, requires a large number of sampled points to regress the surface, which is computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a novel 3D shape representation named NeuralSlice, which represents a 3D shape as the intersection of a 4D tetrahedral mesh and a 4D hyperplane. A novel network is designed to incorporate the proposed representation flexibly, which learns a deformable 4D template and a parameter for slicing 4D hyperplane to reconstruct the 3D object. To learn the local deformation of the 4D template, we further propose a spatial-aware network to locate the 4D points within the 3D feature volume of input shape via positional encoding, which leverages the local geometrical feature to guide the 4D deformation. By addressing the 3D problem in a higher 4D space, our method supports flexible topology changes while being highly efficient. Our method is guaranteed to produce manifold meshes. NeuralSlice outperforms the state-of-the-art explicit-based approaches in terms of reconstruction quality. Compared with implicit approaches, by avoiding point sampling, our method is 10 times faster than the implicit approaches, and better preserves thin structures. NeuralSlice has the capability of representing various shapes and topologies using a single 4D tetrahedral mesh.

MEWL: Few-shot multimodal word learning with referential uncertainty	Without explicit feedback, humans can rapidly learn the meaning of words. Children can acquire a new word after just a few passive exposures, a process known as fast mapping. This word learning capability is believed to be the most fundamental building block of multimodal understanding and reasoning. Despite recent advancements in multimodal learning, a systematic and rigorous evaluation is still missing for human-like word learning in machines. To fill in this gap, we introduce the MachinE Word Learning (MEWL) benchmark to assess how machines learn word meaning in grounded visual scenes. MEWL covers human's core cognitive toolkits in word learning: cross-situational reasoning, bootstrapping, and pragmatic learning. Specifically, MEWL is a few-shot benchmark suite consisting of nine tasks for probing various word learning capabilities. These tasks are carefully designed to be aligned with the children's core abilities in word learning and echo the theories in the developmental literature. By evaluating multimodal and unimodal agents' performance with a comparative analysis of human performance, we notice a sharp divergence in human and machine word learning. We further discuss these differences between humans and machines and call for human-like few-shot word learning in machines.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jiang23i	Guangyuan Jiang, Manjie Xu, Shiji Xin, Wei Liang, Yujia Peng, Chi Zhang, Yixin Zhu
Approximate Causal Effect Identification under Weak Confounding	"Causal effect estimation has been studied by many researchers when only observational data is available. Sound and complete algorithms have been developed for pointwise estimation of identifiable causal queries. For non-identifiable causal queries, researchers developed polynomial programs to estimate tight bounds on causal effect. However, these are computationally difficult to optimize for variables with large support sizes. In this paper, we analyze the effect of ""weak confounding'"" on causal estimands. More specifically, under the assumption that the unobserved confounders that render a query non-identifiable have small entropy, we propose an efficient linear program to derive the upper and lower bounds of the causal effect. We show that our bounds are consistent in the sense that as the entropy of unobserved confounders goes to zero, the gap between the upper and lower bound vanishes. Finally, we conduct synthetic and real data simulations to compare our bounds with the bounds obtained by the existing work that cannot incorporate such entropy constraints and show that our bounds are tighter for the setting with weak confounders."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jiang23h	Ziwei Jiang, Lai Wei, Murat Kocaoglu
Learning Unnormalized Statistical Models via Compositional Optimization	Learning unnormalized statistical models (e.g., energy-based models) is computationally challenging due to the complexity of handling the partition function. To eschew this complexity, noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) has been proposed by formulating the objective as the logistic loss of the real data and the artificial noise. However, as found in previous works, NCE may perform poorly in many tasks due to its flat loss landscape and slow convergence. In this paper, we study a direct approach for optimizing the negative log-likelihood of unnormalized models from the perspective of compositional optimization. To tackle the partition function, a noise distribution is introduced such that the log partition function can be written as a compositional function whose inner function can be estimated with stochastic samples. Hence, the objective can be optimized by stochastic compositional optimization algorithms. Despite being a simple method, we demonstrate that it is more favorable than NCE by (1) establishing a fast convergence rate and quantifying its dependence on the noise distribution through the variance of stochastic estimators; (2) developing better results for one-dimensional Gaussian mean estimation by showing our objective has a much favorable loss landscape and hence our method enjoys faster convergence; (3) demonstrating better performance on multiple applications, including density estimation, out-of-distribution detection, and real image generation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jiang23g	Wei Jiang, Jiayu Qin, Lingyu Wu, Changyou Chen, Tianbao Yang, Lijun Zhang
Towards Stable and Efficient Adversarial Training against $l_1$ Bounded Adversarial Attacks	We address the problem of stably and efficiently training a deep neural network robust to adversarial perturbations bounded by an $l_1$ norm. We demonstrate that achieving robustness against $l_1$-bounded perturbations is more challenging than in the $l_2$ or $l_\infty$ cases, because adversarial training against $l_1$-bounded perturbations is more likely to suffer from catastrophic overfitting and yield training instabilities. Our analysis links these issues to the coordinate descent strategy used in existing methods. We address this by introducing Fast-EG-$l_1$, an efficient adversarial training algorithm based on Euclidean geometry and free of coordinate descent. Fast-EG-$l_1$ comes with no additional memory costs and no extra hyper-parameters to tune. Our experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that Fast-EG-$l_1$ yields the best and most stable robustness against $l_1$-bounded adversarial attacks among the methods of comparable computational complexity. Code and the checkpoints are available at https://github.com/IVRL/FastAdvL.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jiang23f	Yulun Jiang, Chen Liu, Zhichao Huang, Mathieu Salzmann, Sabine Susstrunk
Detecting Out-of-distribution Data through In-distribution Class Prior	Given a pre-trained in-distribution (ID) model, the inference-time out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to recognize OOD data during the inference stage. However, some representative methods share an unproven assumption that the probability that OOD data belong to every ID class should be the same, i.e., these OOD-to-ID probabilities actually form a uniform distribution. In this paper, we show that this assumption makes the above methods incapable when the ID model is trained with class-imbalanced data.Fortunately, by analyzing the causal relations between ID/OOD classes and features, we identify several common scenarios where the OOD-to-ID probabilities should be the ID-class-prior distribution and propose two strategies to modify existing inference-time detection methods: 1) replace the uniform distribution with the ID-class-prior distribution if they explicitly use the uniform distribution; 2) otherwise, reweight their scores according to the similarity between the ID-class-prior distribution and the softmax outputs of the pre-trained model. Extensive experiments show that both strategies can improve the OOD detection performance when the ID model is pre-trained with imbalanced data, reflecting the importance of ID-class prior in OOD detection.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jiang23e	Xue Jiang, Feng Liu, Zhen Fang, Hong Chen, Tongliang Liu, Feng Zheng, Bo Han
Online Restless Bandits with Unobserved States	We study the online restless bandit problem, where each arm evolves according to a Markov chain independently, and the reward of pulling an arm depends on both the current state of the corresponding Markov chain and the pulled arm. The agent (decision maker) does not know the transition functions and reward functions, and cannot observe the states of arms even after pulling. The goal is to sequentially choose which arms to pull so as to maximize the expected cumulative rewards collected. In this paper, we propose TSEETC, a learning algorithm based on Thompson Sampling with Episodic Explore-Then-Commit. The algorithm proceeds in episodes of increasing length and each episode is divided into exploration and exploitation phases. During the exploration phase, samples of action-reward pairs are collected in a round-robin fashion and utilized to update the posterior distribution as a mixture of Dirichlet distributions. At the beginning of the exploitation phase, TSEETC generates a sample from the posterior distribution as true parameters. It then follows the optimal policy for the sampled model for the rest of the episode. We establish the Bayesian regret bound $\tilde {\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ for TSEETC, where $T$ is the time horizon. We show through simulations that TSEETC outperforms existing algorithms in regret.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jiang23d	Bowen Jiang, Bo Jiang, Jian Li, Tao Lin, Xinbing Wang, Chenghu Zhou
Estimating Causal Effects using a Multi-task Deep Ensemble	A number of methods have been proposed for causal effect estimation, yet few have demonstrated efficacy in handling data with complex structures, such as images. To fill this gap, we propose Causal Multi-task Deep Ensemble (CMDE), a novel framework that learns both shared and group-specific information from the study population. We provide proofs demonstrating equivalency of CDME to a multi-task Gaussian process (GP) with a coregionalization kernel a priori. Compared to multi-task GP, CMDE efficiently handles high-dimensional and multi-modal covariates and provides pointwise uncertainty estimates of causal effects. We evaluate our method across various types of datasets and tasks and find that CMDE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a majority of these tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jiang23c	Ziyang Jiang, Zhuoran Hou, Yiling Liu, Yiman Ren, Keyu Li, David Carlson
VIMA: Robot Manipulation with Multimodal Prompts	Prompt-based learning has emerged as a successful paradigm in natural language processing, where a single general-purpose language model can be instructed to perform any task specified by input prompts. Yet task specification in robotics comes in various forms, such as imitating one-shot demonstrations, following language instructions, and reaching visual goals. They are often considered different tasks and tackled by specialized models. We show that a wide spectrum of robot manipulation tasks can be expressed with multimodal prompts, interleaving textual and visual tokens. Accordingly, we develop a new simulation benchmark that consists of thousands of procedurally-generated tabletop tasks with multimodal prompts, 600K+ expert trajectories for imitation learning, and a four-level evaluation protocol for systematic generalization. We design a transformer-based robot agent, VIMA, that processes these prompts and outputs motor actions autoregressively. VIMA features a recipe that achieves strong model scalability and data efficiency. It outperforms alternative designs in the hardest zero-shot generalization setting by up to $2.9\times$ task success rate given the same training data. With $10\times$ less training data, VIMA still performs $2.7\times$ better than the best competing variant.

A Unified Optimization Framework of ANN-SNN Conversion: Towards Optimal Mapping from Activation Values to Firing Rates	Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention for their energy-efficient and fast-inference capabilities, but training SNNs from scratch can be challenging due to the discrete nature of spikes. One alternative method is to convert an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) into an SNN, known as ANN-SNN conversion. Currently, existing ANN-SNN conversion methods often involve redesigning the ANN with a new activation function, rather than utilizing the traditional ReLU, and converting it to an SNN. However, these methods do not take into account the potential performance loss between the regular ANN with ReLU and the tailored ANN. In this work, we propose a unified optimization framework for ANN-SNN conversion that considers both performance loss and conversion error. To achieve this, we introduce the SlipReLU activation function, which is a weighted sum of the threshold-ReLU and the step function. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that conversion error can be zero on a range of shift values $\delta \in [-0.5,0.5]$ rather than a fixed shift term 0.5. We evaluate our SlipReLU method on CIFAR datasets, which shows that SlipReLU outperforms current ANN-SNN conversion methods and supervised training methods in terms of accuracy and latency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ANN-SNN conversion method that enables SNN inference using only 1 time step. Code is available at https://github.com/HaiyanJiang/SNN_Conversion_unified.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jiang23a	Haiyan Jiang, Srinivas Anumasa, Giulia De Masi, Huan Xiong, Bin Gu
Smooth Non-stationary Bandits	In many applications of online decision making, the environment is non-stationary and it is therefore crucial to use bandit algorithms that handle changes. Most existing approaches are designed to protect against non-smooth changes, constrained only by total variation or Lipschitzness over time, where they guarantee $T^{2/3}$ regret. However, in practice environments are often changing	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jia23c	Su Jia, Qian Xie, Nathan Kallus, Peter I. Frazier
Short-lived High-volume Bandits	Modern platforms leverage randomized experiments to make informed decisions from a given set of alternatives. As a particularly challenging scenario, these alternatives can potentially have (i) high volume, with thousands of new items being released each hour, and (ii) short lifetime, either due to the contents' transient nature, or some underlying non-stationarity that impels the learner to treat the same item as non-identical copies across time. We consider a multiplay bandits model. In each round a set of $k=n^\rho$ actions that will be available for $w$ rounds arrives, each of whose mean reward is drawn from a fixed known distribution. The learner selects a multiset of $n$ actions at a time. We propose an $\ell$-Layered Sieve Policy that recursively refines the action space for $\ell\leq w$ times. We show that for any given $\rho>0$, with suitable $\ell$, the policy achieves $\tilde O (n^{-\min \{\rho, \frac 12 (1+\frac 1w)^{-1}\}})$ regret. We also complement this result with an $\Omega (n^{-\min \{\rho, \frac 12\}})$ lower bound. We further validate the effectiveness of our Sieve Policy via numerical simulations and a field experiment in a large content card serving platform.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jia23b	Su Jia, Nishant Oli, Ian Anderson, Paul Duff, Andrew A Li, R.

Bidirectional Adaptation for Robust Semi-Supervised Learning with Inconsistent Data Distributions	Semi-supervised learning (SSL) suffers from severe performance degradation when labeled and unlabeled data come from inconsistent data distributions. However, there is still a lack of sufficient theoretical guidance on how to alleviate this problem. In this paper, we propose a general theoretical framework that demonstrates how distribution discrepancies caused by pseudo-label predictions and target predictions can lead to severe generalization errors. Through theoretical analysis, we identify three main reasons why previous SSL algorithms cannot perform well with inconsistent distributions: coupling between the pseudo-label predictor and the target predictor, biased pseudo labels, and restricted sample weights. To address these challenges, we introduce a practical framework called Bidirectional Adaptation that can adapt to the distribution of unlabeled data for debiased pseudo-label prediction and to the target distribution for debiased target prediction, thereby mitigating these shortcomings. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jia23a	Lin-Han Jia, Lan-Zhe Guo, Zhi Zhou, Jie-Jing Shao, Yuke Xiang, Yu-Feng Li
Leveraging Label Non-Uniformity for Node Classification in Graph Neural Networks	In node classification using graph neural networks (GNNs), a typical model generates logits for different class labels at each node. A softmax layer often outputs a label prediction based on the largest logit. We demonstrate that it is possible to infer hidden graph structural information from the dataset using these logits. We introduce the key notion of label non-uniformity, which is derived from the Wasserstein distance between the softmax distribution of the logits and the uniform distribution. We demonstrate that nodes with small label non-uniformity are harder to classify correctly. We theoretically analyze how the label non-uniformity varies across the graph, which provides insights into boosting the model performance: increasing training samples with high non-uniformity or dropping edges to reduce the maximal cut size of the node set of small non-uniformity. These mechanisms can be easily added to a base GNN model. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of many benchmark base models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ji23a	Feng Ji, See Hian Lee, Hanyang Meng, Kai Zhao, Jielong Yang, Wee Peng Tay
Recovering Top-Two Answers and Confusion Probability in Multi-Choice Crowdsourcing	Crowdsourcing has emerged as an effective platform for labeling large amounts of data in a cost- and time-efficient manner. Most previous work has focused on designing an efficient algorithm to recover only the ground-truth labels of the data. In this paper, we consider multi-choice crowdsourcing tasks with the goal of recovering not only the ground truth, but also the most confusing answer and the confusion probability. The most confusing answer provides useful information about the task by revealing the most plausible answer other than the ground truth and how plausible it is. To theoretically analyze such scenarios, we propose a model in which there are the top two plausible answers for each task, distinguished from the rest of the choices. Task difficulty is quantified by the probability of confusion between the top two, and worker reliability is quantified by the probability of giving an answer among the top two. Under this model, we propose a two-stage inference algorithm to infer both the top two answers and the confusion probability. We show that our algorithm achieves the minimax optimal convergence rate. We conduct both synthetic and real data experiments and demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms other recent algorithms. We also show the applicability of our algorithms in inferring the difficulty of tasks and in training neural networks with top-two soft labels.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jeong23a	Hyeonsu Jeong, Hye Won Chung
BiRT: Bio-inspired Replay in Vision Transformers for Continual Learning	The ability of deep neural networks to continually learn and adapt to a sequence of tasks has remained challenging due to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. Humans, on the other hand, have a remarkable ability to acquire, assimilate, and transfer knowledge across tasks throughout their lifetime without catastrophic forgetting. The versatility of the brain can be attributed to the rehearsal of abstract experiences through a complementary learning system. However, representation rehearsal in vision transformers lacks diversity, resulting in overfitting and consequently, performance drops significantly compared to raw image rehearsal. Therefore, we propose BiRT, a novel representation rehearsal-based continual learning approach using vision transformers. Specifically, we introduce controllable noises at various stages of the vision transformer and enforce consistency in predictions with respect to an exponential moving average of the working model. Our method provides consistent performance gain over raw image and vanilla representation rehearsal on several challenging CL benchmarks while being memory efficient and robust to natural and adversarial corruptions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jeeveswaran23a	Kishaan Jeeveswaran, Prashant Shivaram Bhat, Bahram Zonooz, Elahe Arani

Unscented Autoencoder	The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a seminal approach in deep generative modeling with latent variables. Interpreting its reconstruction process as a nonlinear transformation of samples from the latent posterior distribution, we apply the Unscented Transform (UT) – a well-known distribution approximation used in the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) from the field of filtering. A finite set of statistics called sigma points, sampled deterministically, provides a more informative and lower-variance posterior representation than the ubiquitous noise-scaling of the reparameterization trick, while ensuring higher-quality reconstruction. We further boost the performance by replacing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with the Wasserstein distribution metric that allows for a sharper posterior. Inspired by the two components, we derive a novel, deterministic-sampling flavor of the VAE, the Unscented Autoencoder (UAE), trained purely with regularization-like terms on the per-sample posterior. We empirically show competitive performance in Fréchet Inception Distance scores over closely-related models, in addition to a lower training variance than the VAE.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/janjos23a	Faris Janjos, Lars Rosenbaum, Maxim Dolgov, J.

Learning to Boost Training by Periodic Nowcasting Near Future Weights	Recent complicated problems require large-scale datasets and complex model architectures, however, it is difficult to train such large networks due to high computational issues. Significant efforts have been made to make the training more efficient such as momentum, learning rate scheduling, weight regularization, and meta-learning. Based on our observations on 1) high correlation between past eights and future weights, 2) conditions for beneficial weight prediction, and 3) feasibility of weight prediction, we propose a more general framework by intermittently skipping a handful of epochs by periodically forecasting near future weights, i.e., a Weight Nowcaster Network (WNN). As an add-on module, WNN predicts the future weights to make the learning process faster regardless of tasks and architectures. Experimental results show that WNN can significantly save actual time cost for training with an additional marginal time to train WNN. We validate the generalization capability of WNN under various tasks, and demonstrate that it works well even for unseen tasks. The code and pre-trained model are available at https://github.com/jjh6297/WNN.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jang23b	Jinhyeok Jang, Woo-Han Yun, Won Hwa Kim, Youngwoo Yoon, Jaehong Kim, Jaeyeon Lee, Byungok Han
Exploring the Benefits of Training Expert Language Models over Instruction Tuning	Recently, Language Models (LMs) instruction-tuned on multiple tasks, also known as multitask-prompted fine-tuning (MT), have shown capabilities to generalize to unseen tasks. Previous work has shown that scaling the number of finetuning datasets and instructions is the key component in making stronger MT LMs. In this work, we report surprising findings that show an expert LM trained on just a single task can outperform an MT LM trained with 300+ different tasks on 11 different unseen datasets and on 13 datasets of the BIG-bench benchmark by an average of 3.20% and 1.29%, respectively. This finding casts doubt on the previously held belief that simply scaling the number of tasks makes stronger MT LMs. Leveraging this finding, we further show that this distributed approach of training multiple expert LMs instead of a single MT LM for zero-shot inference possesses many benefits including (1) avoiding negative task transfer that often occurs during instruction tuning, (2) being able to continually learn new tasks without having to re-train on previous tasks to avoid catastrophic forgetting, and (3) showing compositional capabilities when merging individual experts together.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jang23a	Joel Jang, Seungone Kim, Seonghyeon Ye, Doyoung Kim, Lajanugen Logeswaran, Moontae Lee, Kyungjae Lee, Minjoon Seo
Instant Soup: Cheap Pruning Ensembles in A Single Pass Can Draw Lottery Tickets from Large Models	Large pre-trained transformers have been receiving explosive attention in the past few years, due to their acculturation for numerous downstream applications via fine-tuning, but their exponentially increasing parameter counts are becoming a primary hurdle to even just fine-tune them without industry-standard hardware. Recently, Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) and its variants, have been exploited to prune these large pre-trained models generating subnetworks which can achieve similar performance as their dense counterparts, but LTH pragmatism is enormously inhibited by repetitive full training and pruning routine of iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) which worsens with increasing model size. Motivated by the recent observations of model soups, which suggest that fine-tuned weights of multiple models can be merged to a better minima, we propose	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jaiswal23b	Ajay Kumar Jaiswal, Shiwei Liu, Tianlong Chen, Ying Ding, Zhangyang Wang
Graph Ladling: Shockingly Simple Parallel GNN Training without Intermediate Communication	Graphs are omnipresent and GNNs are a powerful family of neural networks for learning over graphs. Despite their popularity, scaling GNNs either by deepening or widening suffers from prevalent issues of $\textit{unhealthy gradients, over-smoothening, information squashing}$, which often lead to sub-standard performance. In this work, we are interested in exploring a principled way to scale GNNs capacity without deepening or widening, which can improve its performance across multiple small and large graphs. Motivated by the recent intriguing phenomenon of model soups, which suggest that fine-tuned weights of multiple large-language pre-trained models can be merged to a better minima, we argue to exploit the fundamentals of model soups to mitigate the aforementioned issues of memory bottleneck and trainability during GNNs scaling. More specifically, we propose not to deepen or widen current GNNs, but instead present $\textbf{first data-centric perspective}$ of model soups to build powerful GNNs by dividing giant graph data to build independently and parallelly trained multiple comparatively weaker GNNs without any intermediate communication, and $\textit{combining their strength}$ using a greedy interpolation soup procedure to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, we provide a wide variety of model soup preparation techniques by leveraging state-of-the-art graph sampling and graph partitioning approaches that can handle large graph data structures. Our extensive experiments across many real-world small and large graphs, illustrate the effectiveness of our approach and point towards a promising orthogonal direction for GNN scaling.

The Price of Differential Privacy under Continual Observation	We study the accuracy of differentially private mechanisms in the continual release model. A continual release mechanism receives a sensitive dataset as a stream of $T$ inputs and produces, after receiving each input, an output that is accurate for all the inputs received so far. We provide the first strong lower bounds on the error of continual release mechanisms. In particular, for two fundamental problems that are closely related to empirical risk minimization and widely studied and used in the standard (batch) model, we prove that the worst case error of every continual release algorithm is $\tilde \Omega(T^{1/3})$ times larger than that of the best batch algorithm. Previous work shows only a $\Omega(\log T)$ gap between the worst case error achievable in these two models. We also formulate a model that allows for adaptively selected inputs, thus capturing dependencies that arise in many applications of continual release. Even though, in general, both privacy and accuracy are harder to attain in this model, we show that our lower bounds are matched by the error of simple algorithms that work even for adaptively selected inputs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jain23b	Palak Jain, Sofya Raskhodnikova, Satchit Sivakumar, Adam Smith

Unconstrained Online Learning with Unbounded Losses	Algorithms for online learning typically require one or more boundedness assumptions: that the domain is bounded, that the losses are Lipschitz, or both. In this paper, we develop a new setting for online learning with unbounded domains and non-Lipschitz losses. For this setting we provide an algorithm which guarantees $R_{T}(u)\le \tilde O(G\|u\|\sqrt{T}+L\|u\|^{2}\sqrt{T})$ regret on any problem where the subgradients satisfy $\|g_{t}\|\le G+L\|w_{t}\|$, and show that this bound is unimprovable without further assumptions. We leverage this algorithm to develop new saddle-point optimization algorithms that converge in duality gap in unbounded domains, even in the absence of meaningful curvature. Finally, we provide the first algorithm achieving non-trivial dynamic regret in an unbounded domain for non-Lipschitz losses, as well as a matching lower bound. The regret of our dynamic regret algorithm automatically improves to a novel $L^{*}$ bound when the losses are smooth.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jacobsen23a	Andrew Jacobsen, Ashok Cutkosky
Scalable Adaptive Computation for Iterative Generation	Natural data is redundant yet predominant architectures tile computation uniformly across their input and output space. We propose the Recurrent Interface Network (RIN), an attention-based architecture that decouples its core computation from the dimensionality of the data, enabling adaptive computation for more scalable generation of high-dimensional data. RINs focus the bulk of computation (i.e. global self-attention) on a set of latent tokens, using cross-attention to read and write (i.e. route) information between latent and data tokens. Stacking RIN blocks allows bottom-up (data to latent) and top-down (latent to data) feedback, leading to deeper and more expressive routing. While this routing introduces challenges, this is less problematic in recurrent computation settings where the task (and routing problem) changes gradually, such as iterative generation with diffusion models. We show how to leverage recurrence by conditioning the latent tokens at each forward pass of the reverse diffusion process with those from prior computation, i.e. latent self-conditioning. RINs yield state-of-the-art pixel diffusion models for image and video generation, scaling to1024×1024 images without cascades or guidance, while being domain-agnostic and up to 10× more efficient than 2D and 3D U-Nets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jabri23a	Allan Jabri, David J.

Efficient Training of Language Models using Few-Shot Learning	Large deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks and demonstrated remarkable few-shot learning performance. However, training them is often challenging and resource-intensive. In this paper, we study an efficient approach to train language models using few-shot learners. We show that, by leveraging the fast learning nature of few-shot learners, one can train language models efficiently in a stagewise manner. Our main insight is that stacking a good few-shot learner on a good small language model provides a good initializer for a larger language model. Using this insight and building upon progressive stacking approaches, we develop novel approaches for training such networks in a stagewise manner. Furthermore, we also provide a theoretical framework and accompanying empirical studies to support our insights, thereby creating a theoretical foundation for progressive stacking. Finally, we provide empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the training time of few-shot learners.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/j-reddi23a	Sashank J.

Data-Driven Subgroup Identification for Linear Regression	Medical studies frequently require to extract the relationship between each covariate and the outcome with statistical confidence measures. To do this, simple parametric models are frequently used (e.g. coefficients of linear regression) but always fitted on the whole dataset. However, it is common that the covariates may not have a uniform effect over the whole population and thus a unified simple model can miss the heterogeneous signal. For example, a linear model may be able to explain a subset of the data but fail on the rest due to the nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the data. In this paper, we propose DDGroup (data-driven group discovery), a data-driven method to effectively identify subgroups in the data with a uniform linear relationship between the features and the label. DDGroup outputs an interpretable region in which the linear model is expected to hold. It is simple to implement and computationally tractable for use. We show theoretically that, given a large enough sample, DDGroup recovers a region where a single linear model with low variance is well-specified (if one exists), and experiments on real-world medical datasets confirm that it can discover regions where a local linear model has improved performance. Our experiments also show that DDGroup can uncover subgroups with qualitatively different relationships which are missed by simply applying parametric approaches to the whole dataset.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/izzo23a	Zachary Izzo, Ruishan Liu, James Zou
Maximal Initial Learning Rates in Deep ReLU Networks	Training a neural network requires choosing a suitable learning rate, which involves a trade-off between speed and effectiveness of convergence. While there has been considerable theoretical and empirical analysis of how large the learning rate can be, most prior work focuses only on late-stage training. In this work, we introduce the maximal initial learning rate $\eta^{\ast}$ - the largest learning rate at which a randomly initialized neural network can successfully begin training and achieve (at least) a given threshold accuracy. Using a simple approach to estimate $\eta^{\ast}$, we observe that in constant-width fully-connected ReLU networks, $\eta^{\ast}$ behaves differently from the maximum learning rate later in training. Specifically, we find that $\eta^{\ast}$ is well predicted as a power of depth $\times$ width, provided that (i) the width of the network is sufficiently large compared to the depth, and (ii) the input layer is trained at a relatively small learning rate. We further analyze the relationship between $\eta^{\ast}$ and the sharpness $\lambda_{1}$ of the network at initialization, indicating they are closely though not inversely related. We formally prove bounds for $\lambda_{1}$ in terms of depth $\times$ width that align with our empirical results.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/iyer23a	Gaurav Iyer, Boris Hanin, David Rolnick
DoG is SGD’s Best Friend: A Parameter-Free Dynamic Step Size Schedule	"We propose a tuning-free dynamic SGD step size formula, which we call Distance over Gradients (DoG). The DoG step sizes depend on simple empirical quantities (distance from the initial point and norms of gradients) and have no ""learning rate"" parameter. Theoretically, we show that, for stochastic convex optimization, a slight variation of the DoG formula enjoys strong, high-probability parameter-free convergence guarantees and iterate movement bounds. Empirically, we consider a broad range of vision and language transfer learning tasks, and show that DoG's performance is close to that of SGD with tuned learning rate. We also propose a per-layer variant of DoG that generally outperforms tuned SGD, approaching the performance of tuned Adam.

CO-BED: Information-Theoretic Contextual Optimization via Bayesian Experimental Design	We formalize the problem of contextual optimization through the lens of Bayesian experimental design and propose CO-BED—a general, model-agnostic framework for designing contextual experiments using information-theoretic principles. After formulating a suitable information-based objective, we employ black-box variational methods to simultaneously estimate it and optimize the designs in a single stochastic gradient scheme. In addition, to accommodate discrete actions within our framework, we propose leveraging continuous relaxation schemes, which can naturally be integrated into our variational objective. As a result, CO-BED provides a general and automated solution to a wide range of contextual optimization problems. We illustrate its effectiveness in a number of experiments, where CO-BED demonstrates competitive performance even when compared to bespoke, model-specific alternatives.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ivanova23a	Desi R.

Unveiling the Latent Space Geometry of Push-Forward Generative Models	Many deep generative models are defined as a push-forward of a Gaussian measure by a continuous generator, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). This work explores the latent space of such deep generative models. A key issue with these models is their tendency to output samples outside of the support of the target distribution when learning disconnected distributions. We investigate the relationship between the performance of these models and the geometry of their latent space. Building on recent developments in geometric measure theory, we prove a sufficient condition for optimality in the case where the dimension of the latent space is larger than the number of modes. Through experiments on GANs, we demonstrate the validity of our theoretical results and gain new insights into the latent space geometry of these models. Additionally, we propose a truncation method that enforces a simplicial cluster structure in the latent space and improves the performance of GANs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/issenhuth23a	Thibaut Issenhuth, Ugo Tanielian, Jeremie Mary, David Picard
Principled Offline RL in the Presence of Rich Exogenous Information	Learning to control an agent from offline data collected in a rich pixel-based visual observation space is vital for real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL). A major challenge in this setting is the presence of input information that is hard to model and irrelevant to controlling the agent. This problem has been approached by the theoretical RL community through the lens of	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/islam23a	Riashat Islam, Manan Tomar, Alex Lamb, Yonathan Efroni, Hongyu Zang, Aniket Rajiv Didolkar, Dipendra Misra, Xin Li, Harm Van Seijen, Remi Tachet Des Combes, John Langford
Neural Network Accelerated Implicit Filtering: Integrating Neural Network Surrogates With Provably Convergent Derivative Free Optimization Methods	In this paper, we introduce neural network accelerated implicit filtering (NNAIF), a novel family of methods for solving noisy derivative free (i.e. black box, zeroth order) optimization problems. NNAIF intelligently combines the established literature on implicit filtering (IF) optimization methods with a neural network (NN) surrogate model of the objective function, resulting in accelerated derivative free methods for unconstrained optimization problems. The NN surrogate model consists of a fixed number of parameters, which can be as few as $\approx 1.3 \times 10^{4}$, that are updated as NNAIF progresses. We show that NNAIF directly inherits the convergence properties of IF optimization methods, and thus NNAIF is guaranteed to converge towards a critical point of the objective function under appropriate assumptions. Numerical experiments with $31$ noisy problems from the CUTEst optimization benchmark set demonstrate the benefits and costs associated with NNAIF. These benefits include NNAIF's ability to minimize structured functions of several thousand variables much more rapidly than well-known alternatives, such as Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) and finite difference based variants of gradient descent (GD) and BFGS, as well as its namesake IF.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/irwin23a	Brian Irwin, Eldad Haber, Raviv Gal, Avi Ziv

Stochastic Marginal Likelihood Gradients using Neural Tangent Kernels	Selecting hyperparameters in deep learning greatly impacts its effectiveness but requires manual effort and expertise. Recent works show that Bayesian model selection with Laplace approximations can allow to optimize such hyperparameters just like standard neural network parameters using gradients and on the training data. However, estimating a single hyperparameter gradient requires a pass through the entire dataset, limiting the scalability of such algorithms. In this work, we overcome this issue by introducing lower bounds to the linearized Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood. In contrast to previous estimators, these bounds are amenable to stochastic-gradient-based optimization and allow to trade off estimation accuracy against computational complexity. We derive them using the function-space form of the linearized Laplace, which can be estimated using the neural tangent kernel. Experimentally, we show that the estimators can significantly accelerate gradient-based hyperparameter optimization.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/immer23b	Alexander Immer, Tycho F. A.

On the Identifiability and Estimation of Causal Location-Scale Noise Models	We study the class of location-scale or heteroscedastic noise models (LSNMs), in which the effect $Y$ can be written as a function of the cause $X$ and a noise source $N$ independent of $X$, which may be scaled by a positive function $g$ over the cause, i.e., $Y = f(X) + g(X)N$. Despite the generality of the model class, we show the causal direction is identifiable up to some pathological cases. To empirically validate these theoretical findings, we propose two estimators for LSNMs: an estimator based on (non-linear) feature maps, and one based on neural networks. Both model the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$ as a Gaussian parameterized by its natural parameters. When the feature maps are correctly specified, we prove that our estimator is jointly concave, and a consistent estimator for the cause-effect identification task. Although the the neural network does not inherit those guarantees, it can fit functions of arbitrary complexity, and reaches state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/immer23a	Alexander Immer, Christoph Schultheiss, Julia E Vogt, Bernhard Schölkopf, Peter Bühlmann, Alexander Marx
Under-Counted Tensor Completion with Neural Incorporation of Attributes	Systematic under-counting effects are observed in data collected across many disciplines, e.g., epidemiology and ecology. Under-counted tensor completion (UC-TC) is well-motivated for many data analytics tasks, e.g., inferring the case numbers of infectious diseases at unobserved locations from under-counted case numbers in neighboring regions. However, existing methods for similar problems often lack supports in theory, making it hard to understand the underlying principles and conditions beyond empirical successes. In this work, a low-rank Poisson tensor model with an expressive unknown nonlinear side information extractor is proposed for under-counted multi-aspect data. A joint low-rank tensor completion and neural network learning algorithm is designed to recover the model. Moreover, the UC-TC formulation is supported by theoretical analysis showing that the fully counted entries of the tensor and each entry's under-counting probability can be provably recovered from partial observations—under reasonable conditions. To our best knowledge, the result is the first to offer theoretical supports for under-counted multi-aspect data completion. Simulations and real-data experiments corroborate the theoretical claims.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ibrahim23a	Shahana Ibrahim, Xiao Fu, Rebecca Hutchinson, Eugene Seo
Information-Theoretic State Space Model for Multi-View Reinforcement Learning	Multi-View Reinforcement Learning (MVRL) seeks to find an optimal control for an agent given multi-view observations from various sources. Despite recent advances in multi-view learning that aim to extract the latent representation from multi-view data, it is not straightforward to apply them to control tasks, especially when the observations are temporally dependent on one another. The problem can be even more challenging if the observations are intermittently missing for a subset of views. In this paper, we introduce Fuse2Control (F2C), an information-theoretic approach to capturing the underlying state space model from the sequences of multi-view observations. We conduct an extensive set of experiments in various control tasks showing that our method is highly effective in aggregating task-relevant information across many views, that scales linearly with the number of views while retaining robustness to arbitrary missing view scenarios.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hwang23c	Hyeongjoo Hwang, Seokin Seo, Youngsoo Jang, Sungyoon Kim, Geon-Hyeong Kim, Seunghoon Hong, Kee-Eung Kim
MAGANet: Achieving Combinatorial Generalization by Modeling a Group Action	Combinatorial generalization refers to the ability to collect and assemble various attributes from diverse data to generate novel unexperienced data. This ability is considered a necessary passing point for achieving human-level intelligence. To achieve this ability, previous unsupervised approaches mainly focused on learning the disentangled representation, such as the variational autoencoder. However, recent studies discovered that the disentangled representation is insufficient for combinatorial generalization and is not even correlated. In this regard, we propose a novel framework for data generation that can robustly generalize under these distribution shift situations. Instead of representing each data, our model discovers the fundamental transformation between a pair of data by simulating a group action. To test the combinatorial generalizability, we evaluated our model in two settings: Recombination-to-Element and Recombination-to-Range. The experiments demonstrated that our method has quantitatively and qualitatively superior generalizability and generates better images than traditional models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hwang23b	Geonho Hwang, Jaewoong Choi, Hyunsoo Cho, Myungjoo Kang
Combinatorial Neural Bandits	We consider a contextual combinatorial bandit problem where in each round a learning agent selects a subset of arms and receives feedback on the selected arms according to their scores. The score of an arm is an unknown function of the arm's feature. Approximating this unknown score function with deep neural networks, we propose algorithms: Combinatorial Neural UCB ($\texttt{CN-UCB}$) and Combinatorial Neural Thompson Sampling ($\texttt{CN-TS}$). We prove that $\texttt{CN-UCB}$ achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\tilde{d} \sqrt{T})$ or $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\tilde{d} T K})$ regret, where $\tilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of a neural tangent kernel matrix, $K$ is the size of a subset of arms, and $T$ is the time horizon. For $\texttt{CN-TS}$, we adapt an optimistic sampling technique to ensure the optimism of the sampled combinatorial action, achieving a worst-case (frequentist) regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\tilde{d} \sqrt{TK})$. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first combinatorial neural bandit algorithms with regret performance guarantees. In particular, $\texttt{CN-TS}$ is the first Thompson sampling algorithm with the worst-case regret guarantees for the general contextual combinatorial bandit problem. The numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performances of our proposed algorithms.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hwang23a	Taehyun Hwang, Kyuwook Chai, Min-Hwan Oh
The Impact of Exploration on Convergence and Performance of Multi-Agent Q-Learning Dynamics	Understanding the impact of exploration on the behaviour of multi-agent learning has, so far, benefited from the restriction to potential, or network zero-sum games in which convergence to an equilibrium can be shown. Outside of these classes, learning dynamics rarely converge and little is known about the effect of exploration in the face of non-convergence. To progress this front, we study the smooth Q- Learning dynamics. We show that, in any network game, exploration by agents results in the convergence of Q-Learning to a neighbourhood of an equilibrium. This holds independently of whether the dynamics reach the equilibrium or display complex behaviours. We show that increasing the exploration rate decreases the size of this neighbourhood and also decreases the ability of all agents to improve their payoffs. Furthermore, in a broad class of games, the payoff performance of Q-Learning dynamics, measured by Social Welfare, decreases when the exploration rate increases. Our experiments show this to be a general phenomenon, namely that exploration leads to improved convergence of Q-Learning, at the cost of payoff performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hussain23a	Aamal Hussain, Francesco Belardinelli, Dario Paccagnan
One-Shot Federated Conformal Prediction	In this paper, we present a Conformal Prediction method that computes prediction sets in a one-shot Federated Learning (FL) setting. More specifically, we introduce a novel quantile-of-quantiles estimator and prove that for any distribution, it is possible to compute prediction sets with desired coverage in only one round of communication. To mitigate privacy issues, we also describe a locally differentially private version of our estimator. Finally, over a wide range of experiments, we show that our method returns prediction sets with coverage and length very similar to those obtained in a centralized setting. These results demonstrate that our method is well-suited for one-shot Federated Learning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/humbert23a	Pierre Humbert, Batiste Le Bars, Aurélien Bellet, Sylvain Arlot
SOM-CPC: Unsupervised Contrastive Learning with Self-Organizing Maps for Structured Representations of High-Rate Time Series	Continuous monitoring with an ever-increasing number of sensors has become ubiquitous across many application domains. However, acquired time series are typically high-dimensional and difficult to interpret. Expressive deep learning (DL) models have gained popularity for dimensionality reduction, but the resulting latent space often remains difficult to interpret. In this work we propose SOM-CPC, a model that visualizes data in an organized 2D manifold, while preserving higher-dimensional information. We address a largely unexplored and challenging set of scenarios comprising high-rate time series, and show on both synthetic and real-life data (physiological data and audio recordings) that SOM-CPC outperforms strong baselines like DL-based feature extraction, followed by conventional dimensionality reduction techniques, and models that jointly optimize a DL model and a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). SOM-CPC has great potential to acquire a better understanding of latent patterns in high-rate data streams.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/huijben23a	Iris A.M.

Cut your Losses with Squentropy	"Nearly all practical neural models for classification are trained using the cross-entropy loss. Yet this ubiquitous choice is supported by little theoretical or empirical evidence. Recent work (Hui & Belkin, 2020) suggests that training using the (rescaled) square loss is often superior in terms of the classification accuracy. In this paper we propose the ""squentropy"" loss, which is the sum of two terms: the cross-entropy loss and the average square loss over the incorrect classes. We provide an extensive set of experiment on multi-class classification problems showing that the squentropy loss outperforms both the pure cross-entropy and rescaled square losses in terms of the classification accuracy. We also demonstrate that it provides significantly better model calibration than either of these alternative losses and, furthermore, has less variance with respect to the random initialization. Additionally, in contrast to the square loss, squentropy loss can frequently be trained using exactly the same optimization parameters, including the learning rate, as the standard cross-entropy loss, making it a true ""plug-and-play"" replacement. Finally, unlike the rescaled square loss, multiclass squentropy contains no parameters that need to be adjusted."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hui23a	Like Hui, Mikhail Belkin, Stephen Wright
Straightening Out the Straight-Through Estimator: Overcoming Optimization Challenges in Vector Quantized Networks	This work examines the challenges of training neural networks using vector quantization using straight-through estimation. We find that the main cause of training instability is the discrepancy between the model embedding and the code-vector distribution. We identify the factors that contribute to this issue, including the codebook gradient sparsity and the asymmetric nature of the commitment loss, which leads to misaligned code-vector assignments. We propose to address this issue via affine re-parameterization of the code vectors. Additionally, we introduce an alternating optimization to reduce the gradient error introduced by the straight-through estimation. Moreover, we propose an improvement to the commitment loss to ensure better alignment between the codebook representation and the model embedding. These optimization methods improve the mathematical approximation of the straight-through estimation and, ultimately, the model performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on several common model architectures, such as AlexNet, ResNet, and ViT, across various tasks, including image classification and generative modeling.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/huh23a	Minyoung Huh, Brian Cheung, Pulkit Agrawal, Phillip Isola
Federated Linear Contextual Bandits with User-level Differential Privacy	This paper studies federated linear contextual bandits under the notion of user-level differential privacy (DP). We first introduce a unified federated bandits framework that can accommodate various definitions of DP in the sequential decision-making setting. We then formally introduce user-level central DP (CDP) and local DP (LDP) in the federated bandits framework, and investigate the fundamental trade-offs between the learning regrets and the corresponding DP guarantees in a federated linear contextual bandits model. For CDP, we propose a federated algorithm termed as $\texttt{ROBIN}$ and show that it is near-optimal in terms of the number of clients $M$ and the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ by deriving nearly-matching upper and lower regret bounds when user-level DP is satisfied. For LDP, we obtain several lower bounds, indicating that learning under user-level $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-LDP must suffer a regret blow-up factor at least $\min\{1/\varepsilon,M\}$ or $\min\{1/\sqrt{\varepsilon},\sqrt{M}\}$ under different conditions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/huang23q	Ruiquan Huang, Huanyu Zhang, Luca Melis, Milan Shen, Meisam Hejazinia, Jing Yang
Achieving Linear Speedup in Non-IID Federated Bilevel Learning	Federated bilevel learning has received increasing attention in various emerging machine learning and communication applications. Recently, several Hessian-vector-based algorithms have been proposed to solve the federated bilevel optimization problem. However, several important properties in federated learning such as the partial client participation and the linear speedup for convergence (i.e., the convergence rate and complexity are improved linearly with respect to the number of sampled clients) in the presence of non-i.i.d. datasets, still remain open. In this paper, we fill these gaps by proposing a new federated bilevel algorithm named FedMBO with a novel client sampling scheme in the federated hypergradient estimation. We show that FedMBO achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{nK}}+\frac{1}{K}+\frac{\sqrt{n}}{K^{3/2}}\big)$ on non-i.i.d. datasets, where $n$ is the number of participating clients in each round, and $K$ is the total number of iteration. This is the first theoretical linear speedup result for non-i.i.d. federated bilevel optimization. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/huang23p	Minhui Huang, Dewei Zhang, Kaiyi Ji
Are Large Kernels Better Teachers than Transformers for ConvNets?	"This paper reveals a new appeal of the recently emerged large-kernel Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets): as the teacher in Knowledge Distillation (KD) for small-kernel ConvNets. While Transformers have led state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in various fields with ever-larger models and labeled data, small-kernel ConvNets are considered more suitable for resource-limited applications due to the efficient convolution operation and compact weight sharing. KD is widely used to boost the performance of small-kernel ConvNets. However, previous research shows that it is not quite effective to distill knowledge (e.g., global information) from Transformers to small-kernel ConvNets, presumably due to their disparate architectures. We hereby carry out a first-of-its-kind study unveiling that modern large-kernel ConvNets, a compelling competitor to Vision Transformers, are remarkably more effective teachers for small-kernel ConvNets, due to more similar architectures. Our findings are backed up by extensive experiments on both logit-level and feature-level KD ""out of the box"", with no dedicated architectural nor training recipe modifications.

Policy Contrastive Imitation Learning	Adversarial imitation learning (AIL) is a popular method that has recently achieved much success. However, the performance of AIL is still unsatisfactory on the more challenging tasks. We find that one of the major reasons is due to the low quality of AIL discriminator representation. Since the AIL discriminator is trained via binary classification that does not necessarily discriminate the policy from the expert in a meaningful way, the resulting reward might not be meaningful either. We propose a new method called Policy Contrastive Imitation Learning (PCIL) to resolve this issue. PCIL learns a contrastive representation space by anchoring on different policies and uses a smooth cosine-similarity-based reward to encourage imitation learning. Our proposed representation learning objective can be viewed as a stronger version of the AIL objective and provide a more meaningful comparison between the agent and the policy. From a theoretical perspective, we show the validity of our method using the apprenticeship learning framework. Furthermore, our empirical evaluation on the DeepMind Control suite demonstrates that PCIL can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Finally, qualitative results suggest that PCIL builds a smoother and more meaningful representation space for imitation learning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/huang23n	Jialei Huang, Zhao-Heng Yin, Yingdong Hu, Yang Gao
NeuralStagger: Accelerating Physics-constrained Neural PDE Solver with Spatial-temporal Decomposition	Neural networks have shown great potential in accelerating the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). Recently, there has been a growing interest in introducing physics constraints into training neural PDE solvers to reduce the use of costly data and improve the generalization ability. However, these physics constraints, based on certain finite dimensional approximations over the function space, must resolve the smallest scaled physics to ensure the accuracy and stability of the simulation, resulting in high computational costs from large input, output, and neural networks. This paper proposes a general acceleration methodology called NeuralStagger by spatially and temporally decomposing the original learning tasks into several coarser-resolution subtasks. We define a coarse-resolution neural solver for each subtask, which requires fewer computational resources, and jointly train them with the vanilla physics-constrained loss by simply arranging their outputs to reconstruct the original solution. Due to the perfect parallelism between them, the solution is achieved as fast as a coarse-resolution neural solver. In addition, the trained solvers bring the flexibility of simulating with multiple levels of resolution. We demonstrate the successful application of NeuralStagger on 2D and 3D fluid dynamics simulations, which leads to an additional $10\sim100\times$ speed-up. Moreover, the experiment also shows that the learned model could be well used for optimal control.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/huang23m	Xinquan Huang, Wenlei Shi, Qi Meng, Yue Wang, Xiaotian Gao, Jia Zhang, Tie-Yan Liu
Theoretical Bounds on the Network Community Profile from Low-rank Semi-definite Programming	We study a new connection between a technical measure called $\mu$-conductance that arises in the study of Markov chains for sampling convex bodies and the network community profile that characterizes size-resolved properties of clusters and communities in social and information networks. The idea of $\mu$-conductance is similar to the traditional graph conductance, but disregards sets with small volume. We derive a sequence of optimization problems including a low-rank semi-definite program from which we can derive a lower bound on the optimal $\mu$-conductance value. These ideas give the first theoretically sound bound on the behavior of the network community profile for a wide range of cluster sizes. The algorithm scales up to graphs with hundreds of thousands of nodes and we demonstrate how our framework validates the predicted structures of real-world graphs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/huang23l	Yufan Huang, C.

Reparameterized Policy Learning for Multimodal Trajectory Optimization	We investigate the challenge of parametrizing policies for reinforcement learning (RL) in high-dimensional continuous action spaces. Our objective is to develop a multimodal policy that overcomes limitations inherent in the commonly-used Gaussian parameterization. To achieve this, we propose a principled framework that models the continuous RL policy as a generative model of optimal trajectories. By conditioning the policy on a latent variable, we derive a novel variational bound as the optimization objective, which promotes exploration of the environment. We then present a practical model-based RL method, called Reparameterized Policy Gradient (RPG), which leverages the multimodal policy parameterization and learned world model to achieve strong exploration capabilities and high data efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our method can help agents evade local optima in tasks with dense rewards and solve challenging sparse-reward environments by incorporating an object-centric intrinsic reward. Our method consistently outperforms previous approaches across a range of tasks.

The Power of Uniform Sampling for k-Median	We study the power of uniform sampling for $k$-Median in various metric spaces. We relate the query complexity for approximating $k$-Median, to a key parameter of the dataset, called the balancedness $\beta \in (0, 1]$ (with $1$ being perfectly balanced). We show that any algorithm must make $\Omega(1 / \beta)$ queries to the point set in order to achieve $O(1)$-approximation for $k$-Median. This particularly implies existing constructions of coresets, a popular data reduction technique, cannot be query-efficient. On the other hand, we show a simple uniform sample of $\mathrm{poly}(k \epsilon^{-1} \beta^{-1})$ points suffices for $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximation for $k$-Median for various metric spaces, which nearly matches the lower bound. We conduct experiments to verify that in many real datasets, the balancedness parameter is usually well bounded, and that the uniform sampling performs consistently well even for the case with moderately large balancedness, which justifies that uniform sampling is indeed a viable approach for solving $k$-Median.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/huang23j	Lingxiao Huang, Shaofeng H.-C.

Make-An-Audio: Text-To-Audio Generation with Prompt-Enhanced Diffusion Models	"Large-scale multimodal generative modeling has created milestones in text-to-image and text-to-video generation. Its application to audio still lags behind for two main reasons: the lack of large-scale datasets with high-quality text-audio pairs, and the complexity of modeling long continuous audio data. In this work, we propose Make-An-Audio with a prompt-enhanced diffusion model that addresses these gaps by 1) introducing pseudo prompt enhancement with a distill-then-reprogram approach, it alleviates data scarcity with orders of magnitude concept compositions by using language-free audios; 2) leveraging spectrogram autoencoder to predict the self-supervised audio representation instead of waveforms. Together with robust contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) representations, Make-An-Audio achieves state-of-the-art results in both objective and subjective benchmark evaluation. Moreover, we present its controllability and generalization for X-to-Audio with ""No Modality Left Behind"", for the first time unlocking the ability to generate high-definition, high-fidelity audios given a user-defined modality input.

On Coresets for Clustering in Small Dimensional Euclidean spaces	We consider the problem of constructing small coresets for $k$-Median in Euclidean spaces. Given a large set of data points $P\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, a coreset is a much smaller set $S\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, so that the $k$-Median costs of any $k$ centers w.r.t. $P$ and $S$ are close. Existing literature mainly focuses on the high-dimension case and there has been great success in obtaining dimension-independent bounds, whereas the case for small $d$ is largely unexplored. Considering many applications of Euclidean clustering algorithms are in small dimensions and the lack of systematic studies in the current literature, this paper investigates coresets for $k$-Median in small dimensions. For small $d$, a natural question is whether existing near-optimal dimension-independent bounds can be significantly improved. We provide affirmative answers to this question for a range of parameters. Moreover, new lower bound results are also proved, which are the highest for small $d$. In particular, we completely settle the coreset size bound for $1$-d $k$-Median (up to log factors). Interestingly, our results imply a strong separation between $1$-d $1$-Median and $1$-d $2$-Median. As far as we know, this is the first such separation between $k=1$ and $k=2$ in any dimension.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/huang23h	Lingxiao Huang, Ruiyuan Huang, Zengfeng Huang, Xuan Wu
Searching Large Neighborhoods for Integer Linear Programs with Contrastive Learning	Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are powerful tools for modeling and solving a large number of combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, it has been shown that Large Neighborhood Search (LNS), as a heuristic algorithm, can find high-quality solutions to ILPs faster than Branch and Bound. However, how to find the right heuristics to maximize the performance of LNS remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, CL-LNS, that delivers state-of-the-art anytime performance on several ILP benchmarks measured by metrics including the primal gap, the primal integral, survival rates and the best performing rate. Specifically, CL-LNS collects positive and negative solution samples from an expert heuristic that is slow to compute and learns a more efficient one with contrastive learning. We use graph attention networks and a richer set of features to further improve its performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/huang23g	Taoan Huang, Aaron M Ferber, Yuandong Tian, Bistra Dilkina, Benoit Steiner
Fast Algorithms for Distributed k-Clustering with Outliers	In this paper, we study the $k$-clustering problems with outliers in distributed setting. The current best results for the distributed $k$-center problem with outliers have quadratic local running time with communication cost dependent on the aspect ratio $\Delta$ of the given instance, which may constraint the scalability of the algorithms for handling large-scale datasets. To achieve better communication cost for the problem with faster local running time, we propose an inliers-recalling sampling method, which avoids guessing the optimal radius of the given instance, and can achieve a 4-round bi-criteria $(14(1+\epsilon),1+\epsilon)$-approximation with linear local running time in the data size and communication cost independent of the aspect ratio. To obtain a more practical algorithm for the problem, we propose another space-narrowing sampling method, which automatically adjusts the sample size to adapt to different outliers distributions on each machine, and can achieve a 2-round bi-criteria $(14(1+\epsilon),1+\epsilon)$-approximation with communication cost independent of the number of outliers. We show that, if the data points are randomly partitioned across machines, our proposed sampling-based methods can be extended to the $k$-median/means problems with outliers, and can achieve $(O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}),1+\epsilon)$-approximation with communication cost independent of the number of outliers. Empirical experiments suggest that the proposed 2-round distributed algorithms outperform other state-of-the-art algorithms.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/huang23f	Junyu Huang, Qilong Feng, Ziyun Huang, Jinhui Xu, Jianxin Wang
Banker Online Mirror Descent: A Universal Approach for Delayed Online Bandit Learning	We propose Banker Online Mirror Descent (Banker-OMD), a novel framework generalizing the classical Online Mirror Descent (OMD) technique in the online learning literature. The Banker-OMD framework almost completely decouples feedback delay handling and the task-specific OMD algorithm design, thus facilitating the design of new algorithms capable of efficiently and robustly handling feedback delays. Specifically, it offers a general methodology for achieving $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(\sqrt{T} + \sqrt{D})$-style regret bounds in online bandit learning tasks with delayed feedback, where $T$ is the number of rounds and $D$ is the total feedback delay. We demonstrate the power of Banker-OMD by applications to two important bandit learning scenarios with delayed feedback, including delayed scale-free adversarial Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) and delayed adversarial linear bandits. Banker-OMD leads to the first delayed scale-free adversarial MAB algorithm achieving $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(\sqrt{K}L(\sqrt T+\sqrt D))$ regret and the first delayed adversarial linear bandit algorithm achieving $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(\text{poly}(n)(\sqrt{T} + \sqrt{D}))$ regret. As a corollary, the first application also implies $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(\sqrt{KT}L)$ regret for non-delayed scale-free adversarial MABs, which is the first to match the $\Omega(\sqrt{KT}L)$ lower bound up to logarithmic factors and can be of independent interest.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/huang23e	Jiatai Huang, Yan Dai, Longbo Huang
High-dimensional Clustering onto Hamiltonian Cycle	Clustering aims to group unlabelled samples based on their similarities and is widespread in high-dimensional data analysis. However, most of the clustering methods merely generate pseudo labels and thus are unable to simultaneously present the similarities between different clusters and outliers. This paper proposes a new framework called High-dimensional Clustering onto Hamiltonian Cycle (HCHC) to solve the above problems. First, HCHC combines global structure with local structure in one objective function for deep clustering, improving the labels as relative probabilities, to mine the similarities between different clusters while keeping the local structure in each cluster. Then, the anchors of different clusters are sorted on the optimal Hamiltonian cycle generated by the cluster similarities and mapped on the circumference of a circle. Finally, a sample with a higher probability of a cluster will be mapped closer to the corresponding anchor. In this way, our framework allows us to appreciate three aspects visually and simultaneously - clusters (formed by samples with high probabilities), cluster similarities (represented as circular distances), and outliers (recognized as dots far away from all clusters). The theoretical analysis and experiments illustrate the superiority of HCHC.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/huang23d	Tianyi Huang, Shenghui Cheng, Stan Z. Li, Zhengjun Zhang
Model-Aware Contrastive Learning: Towards Escaping the Dilemmas	Contrastive learning (CL) continuously achieves significant breakthroughs across multiple domains. However, the most common InfoNCE-based methods suffer from some dilemmas, such as uniformity-tolerance dilemma (UTD) and gradient reduction, both of which are related to a $\mathcal{P}_{ij}$ term. It has been identified that UTD can lead to unexpected performance degradation. We argue that the fixity of temperature is to blame for UTD. To tackle this challenge, we enrich the CL loss family by presenting a Model-Aware Contrastive Learning (MACL) strategy, whose temperature is adaptive to the magnitude of alignment that reflects the basic confidence of the instance discrimination task, then enables CL loss to adjust the penalty strength for hard negatives adaptively. Regarding another dilemma, the gradient reduction issue, we derive the limits of an involved gradient scaling factor, which allows us to explain from a unified perspective why some recent approaches are effective with fewer negative samples, and summarily present a gradient reweighting to escape this dilemma. Extensive remarkable empirical results in vision, sentence, and graph modality validate our approach's general improvement for representation learning and downstream tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/huang23c	Zizheng Huang, Haoxing Chen, Ziqi Wen, Chao Zhang, Huaxiong Li, Bo Wang, Chunlin Chen
Composer: Creative and Controllable Image Synthesis with Composable Conditions	Recent large-scale generative models learned on big data are capable of synthesizing incredible images yet suffer from limited controllability. This work offers a new generation paradigm that allows flexible control of the output image, such as spatial layout and palette, while maintaining the synthesis quality and model creativity. With compositionality as the core idea, we first decompose an image into representative factors, and then train a diffusion model with all these factors as the conditions to recompose the input. At the inference stage, the rich intermediate representations work as composable elements, leading to a huge design space (i.e., exponentially proportional to the number of decomposed factors) for customizable content creation. It is noteworthy that our approach, which we call Composer, supports various levels of conditions, such as text description as the global information, depth map and sketch as the local guidance, color histogram for low-level details, etc. Besides improving controllability, we confirm that Composer serves as a general framework and facilitates a wide range of classical generative tasks without retraining. Code and models will be made available.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/huang23b	Lianghua Huang, Di Chen, Yu Liu, Yujun Shen, Deli Zhao, Jingren Zhou
Reinforcement Learning in Low-rank MDPs with Density Features	MDPs with low-rank transitions—that is, the transition matrix can be factored into the product of two matrices, left and right—is a highly representative structure that enables tractable learning. The left matrix enables expressive function approximation for value-based learning and has been studied extensively. In this work, we instead investigate sample-efficient learning with density features, i.e., the right matrix, which induce powerful models for state-occupancy distributions. This setting not only sheds light on leveraging unsupervised learning in RL, but also enables plug-in solutions for settings like convex RL. In the offline setting, we propose an algorithm for off-policy estimation of occupancies that can handle non-exploratory data. Using this as a subroutine, we further devise an online algorithm that constructs exploratory data distributions in a level-by-level manner. As a central technical challenge, the additive error of occupancy estimation is incompatible with the multiplicative definition of data coverage. In the absence of strong assumptions like reachability, this incompatibility easily leads to exponential error blow-up, which we overcome via novel technical tools. Our results also readily extend to the representation learning setting, when the density features are unknown and must be learned from an exponentially large candidate set.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/huang23a	Audrey Huang, Jinglin Chen, Nan Jiang
Understanding the Impact of Adversarial Robustness on Accuracy Disparity	While it has long been empirically observed that adversarial robustness may be at odds with standard accuracy and may have further disparate impacts on different classes, it remains an open question to what extent such observations hold and how the class imbalance plays a role within. In this paper, we attempt to understand this question of accuracy disparity by taking a closer look at linear classifiers under a Gaussian mixture model. We decompose the impact of adversarial robustness into two parts: an inherent effect that will degrade the standard accuracy on all classes due to the robustness constraint, and the other caused by the class imbalance ratio, which will increase the accuracy disparity compared to standard training. Furthermore, we also show that such effects extend beyond the Gaussian mixture model, by generalizing our data model to the general family of stable distributions. More specifically, we demonstrate that while the constraint of adversarial robustness consistently degrades the standard accuracy in the balanced class setting, the class imbalance ratio plays a fundamentally different role in accuracy disparity compared to the Gaussian case, due to the heavy tail of the stable distribution. We additionally perform experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to corroborate our theoretical findings. Our empirical results also suggest that the implications may extend to nonlinear models over real-world datasets. Our code is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/Accuracy-Disparity/AT-on-AD.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hu23j	Yuzheng Hu, Fan Wu, Hongyang Zhang, Han Zhao
Beyond Lipschitz Smoothness: A Tighter Analysis for Nonconvex Optimization	Negative and positive curvatures affect optimization in different ways. However, a lot of existing optimization theories are based on the Lipschitz smoothness assumption, which cannot differentiate between the two. In this paper, we propose to use two separate assumptions for positive and negative curvatures, so that we can study the different implications of the two. We analyze the Lookahead and Local SGD methods as concrete examples. Both of them require multiple copies of model parameters and communication among them for every certain period of time in order to prevent divergence. We show that the minimum communication frequency is inversely proportional to the negative curvature, and when the negative curvature becomes zero, we recover the existing theory results for convex optimization. Finally, both experimentally and theoretically, we demonstrate that modern neural networks have highly unbalanced positive/negative curvatures. Thus, an analysis based on separate positive and negative curvatures is more pertinent.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hu23i	Zhengmian Hu, Xidong Wu, Heng Huang
For Pre-Trained Vision Models in Motor Control, Not All Policy Learning Methods are Created Equal	In recent years, increasing attention has been directed to leveraging pre-trained vision models for motor control. While existing works mainly emphasize the importance of this pre-training phase, the arguably equally important role played by downstream policy learning during control-specific fine-tuning is often neglected. It thus remains unclear if pre-trained vision models are consistent in their effectiveness under different control policies. To bridge this gap in understanding, we conduct a comprehensive study on 14 pre-trained vision models using 3 distinct classes of policy learning methods, including reinforcement learning (RL), imitation learning through behavior cloning (BC), and imitation learning with a visual reward function (VRF). Our study yields a series of intriguing results, including the discovery that the effectiveness of pre-training is highly dependent on the choice of the downstream policy learning algorithm. We show that conventionally accepted evaluation based on RL methods is highly variable and therefore unreliable, and further advocate for using more robust methods like VRF and BC. To facilitate more universal evaluations of pre-trained models and their policy learning methods in the future, we also release a benchmark of 21 tasks across 3 different environments alongside our work.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hu23h	Yingdong Hu, Renhao Wang, Li Erran Li, Yang Gao
Learning to Learn from APIs: Black-Box Data-Free Meta-Learning	Data-free meta-learning (DFML) aims to enable efficient learning of new tasks by meta-learning from a collection of pre-trained models without access to the training data. Existing DFML work can only meta-learn from (i) white-box and (ii) small-scale pre-trained models (iii) with the same architecture, neglecting the more practical setting where the users only have inference access to the APIs with arbitrary model architectures and model scale inside. To solve this issue, we propose a Bi-level Data-free Meta Knowledge Distillation (BiDf-MKD) framework to transfer more general meta knowledge from a collection of black-box APIs to one single meta model. Specifically, by just querying APIs, we inverse each API to recover its training data via a zero-order gradient estimator and then perform meta-learning via a novel bi-level meta knowledge distillation structure, in which we design a boundary query set recovery technique to recover a more informative query set near the decision boundary. In addition, to encourage better generalization within the setting of limited API budgets, we propose task memory replay to diversify the underlying task distribution by covering more interpolated tasks. Extensive experiments in various real-world scenarios show the superior performance of our BiDf-MKD framework.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hu23g	Zixuan Hu, Li Shen, Zhenyi Wang, Baoyuan Wu, Chun Yuan, Dacheng Tao
Surface Snapping Optimization Layer for Single Image Object Shape Reconstruction	Reconstructing the 3D shape of objects observed in a single image is a challenging task. Recent approaches rely on visual cues extracted from a given image learned from a deep net. In this work, we leverage recent advances in monocular scene understanding to incorporate an additional geometric cue of surface normals. For this, we proposed a novel optimization layer that encourages the face normals of the reconstructed shape to be aligned with estimated surface normals. We develop a computationally efficient conjugate-gradient-based method that avoids the computation of a high-dimensional sparse matrix. We show this framework to achieve compelling shape reconstruction results on the challenging Pix3D and ShapeNet datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hu23f	Yuan-Ting Hu, Alex Schwing, Raymond A.

Language Instructed Reinforcement Learning for Human-AI Coordination	One of the fundamental quests of AI is to produce agents that coordinate well with humans. This problem is challenging, especially in domains that lack high quality human behavioral data, because multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) often converges to different equilibria from the ones that humans prefer. We propose a novel framework, instructRL, that enables humans to specify what kind of strategies they expect from their AI partners through natural language instructions. We use pretrained large language models to generate a prior policy conditioned on the human instruction and use the prior to regularize the RL objective. This leads to the RL agent converging to equilibria that are aligned with human preferences. We show that instructRL converges to human-like policies that satisfy the given instructions in a proof-of-concept environment as well as the challenging Hanabi benchmark. Finally, we show that knowing the language instruction significantly boosts human-AI coordination performance in human evaluations in Hanabi.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hu23e	Hengyuan Hu, Dorsa Sadigh
Blockwise Stochastic Variance-Reduced Methods with Parallel Speedup for Multi-Block Bilevel Optimization	In this paper, we consider non-convex multi-block bilevel optimization (MBBO) problems, which involve $m\gg 1$ lower level problems and have important applications in machine learning. Designing a stochastic gradient and controlling its variance is more intricate due to the hierarchical sampling of blocks and data and the unique challenge of estimating hyper-gradient. We aim to achieve three nice properties for our algorithm: (a) matching the state-of-the-art complexity of standard BO problems with a single block; (b) achieving parallel speedup by sampling $I$ blocks and sampling $B$ samples for each sampled block per-iteration; (c) avoiding the computation of the inverse of a high-dimensional Hessian matrix estimator. However, it is non-trivial to achieve all of these by observing that existing works only achieve one or two of these properties. To address the involved challenges for achieving (a, b, c), we propose two stochastic algorithms by using advanced blockwise variance-reduction techniques for tracking the Hessian matrices (for low-dimensional problems) or the Hessian-vector products (for high-dimensional problems), and prove an iteration complexity of $O(\frac{m\epsilon^{-3}\mathbb{I}(I \textless m)}{I\sqrt{I}}+\frac{m\epsilon^{-3}}{I\sqrt{B}})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point under appropriate conditions. We also conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms comparing with existing MBBO algorithms.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hu23d	Quanqi Hu, Zi-Hao Qiu, Zhishuai Guo, Lijun Zhang, Tianbao Yang
GFlowNet-EM for Learning Compositional Latent Variable Models	Latent variable models (LVMs) with discrete compositional latents are an important but challenging setting due to a combinatorially large number of possible configurations of the latents. A key tradeoff in modeling the posteriors over latents is between expressivity and tractable optimization. For algorithms based on expectation-maximization (EM), the E-step is often intractable without restrictive approximations to the posterior. We propose the use of GFlowNets, algorithms for sampling from an unnormalized density by learning a stochastic policy for sequential construction of samples, for this intractable E-step. By training GFlowNets to sample from the posterior over latents, we take advantage of their strengths as amortized variational inference algorithms for complex distributions over discrete structures. Our approach, GFlowNet-EM, enables the training of expressive LVMs with discrete compositional latents, as shown by experiments on non-context-free grammar induction and on images using discrete variational autoencoders (VAEs) without conditional independence enforced in the encoder.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hu23c	Edward J Hu, Nikolay Malkin, Moksh Jain, Katie E Everett, Alexandros Graikos, Yoshua Bengio
Omnipredictors for Constrained Optimization	The notion of omnipredictors (Gopalan, Kalai, Reingold, Sharan and Wieder ITCS 2022), suggested a new paradigm for loss minimization. Rather than learning a predictor based on a known loss function, omnipredictors can easily be post-processed to minimize any one of a rich family of loss functions compared with the loss of hypotheses in a class $\mathcal C$. It has been shown that such omnipredictors exist and are implied (for all convex and Lipschitz loss functions) by the notion of multicalibration from the algorithmic fairness literature. In this paper, we introduce omnipredictors for constrained optimization and study their complexity and implications. The notion that we introduce allows the learner to be unaware of the loss function that will be later assigned	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hu23b	Lunjia Hu, Inbal Rachel Livni Navon, Omer Reingold, Chutong Yang
Tighter Analysis for ProxSkip	In this paper, we provide a tighter analysis for ProxSkip, an algorithm that allows fewer proximal operator computations to solve composite optimization problems. We improve the existing decreasing speed of Lyapunov function from $\mathcal{O}(p^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(p)$, when $p$, the frequency of the proximal operators is small enough. Our theoretical analysis also reveals the drawbacks of using large step sizes for gradient descent in ProxSkip when the proximal operator part is the bottleneck. Our main motivation comes from the continuous limit in which the original analysis of ProxSkip fails to guarantee convergence when both the step size $\gamma$ and frequency $p$ tend to zero. We construct a counterexample to demonstrate why such counterintuitive behavior occurs for the original analysis and then propose a novel Lyapunov function variant to construct a tighter analysis, avoiding the problem of the old one. Such a new Lyapunov function can be directly extended to many other variants of ProxSkip. When applied to stochastic gradient setup, our analysis leads to an improved proximal operator complexity for SProxSkip from $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{1}{\varepsilon\mu^2}}\log(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}))$ to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\kappa}\log(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}))$.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hu23a	Zhengmian Hu, Heng Huang
Thompson Sampling with Diffusion Generative Prior	In this work, we initiate the idea of using denoising diffusion models to learn priors for online decision making problems. We specifically focus on bandit meta-learning, aiming to learn a policy that performs well across bandit tasks of a same class. To this end, we train a diffusion model that learns the underlying task distribution and combine Thompson sampling with the learned prior to deal with new tasks at test time. Our posterior sampling algorithm carefully balances between the learned prior and the noisy observations that come from the learner's interaction with the environment. To capture realistic bandit scenarios, we propose a novel diffusion model training procedure that trains from incomplete and noisy data, which could be of independent interest. Finally, our extensive experiments clearly demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hsieh23a	Yu-Guan Hsieh, Shiva Kasiviswanathan, Branislav Kveton, Patrick Blöbaum
Automatic Data Augmentation via Invariance-Constrained Learning	Underlying data structures, such as symmetries or invariance to transformations, are often exploited to improve the solution of learning tasks. However, embedding these properties in models or learning algorithms can be challenging and computationally intensive. Data augmentation, on the other hand, induces these symmetries during training by applying multiple transformations to the input data. Despite its ubiquity, its effectiveness depends on the choices of which transformations to apply, when to do so, and how often. In fact, there is both empirical and theoretical evidence that the indiscriminate use of data augmentation can introduce biases that outweigh its benefits. This work tackles these issues by automatically adapting the data augmentation while solving the learning task. To do so, it formulates data augmentation as an invariance constrained learning problem and leverages Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling to solve it. The result is an algorithm that not only does away with a priori searches for augmentation distributions, but also dynamically controls if and when data augmentation is applied. We validate empirically our theoretical developments in automatic data augmentation benchmarks for CIFAR and ImageNet-100 datasets. Furthermore, our experiments show how this approach can be used to gather insights on the actual symmetries underlying a learning task.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hounie23a	Ignacio Hounie, Luiz F.

Probably Anytime-Safe Stochastic Combinatorial Semi-Bandits	Motivated by concerns about making online decisions that incur undue amount of risk at each time step, in this paper, we formulate the probably anytime-safe stochastic combinatorial semi-bandits problem. In this problem, the agent is given the option to select a subset of size at most $K$ from a set of $L$ ground items. Each item is associated to a certain mean reward as well as a variance that represents its risk. To mitigate the risk that the agent incurs, we require that with probability at least $1-\delta$, over the entire horizon of time $T$, each of the choices that the agent makes should contain items whose sum of variances does not exceed a certain variance budget. We call this probably anytime-safe constraint. Under this constraint, we design and analyze an algorithm PASCombUCB that minimizes the regret over the horizon of time $T$. By developing accompanying information-theoretic lower bounds, we show that under both the problem-dependent and problem-independent paradigms, PASCombUCB is almost asymptotically optimal. Experiments are conducted to corroborate our theoretical findings. Our problem setup, the proposed PASCombUCB algorithm, and novel analyses are applicable to domains such as recommendation systems and transportation in which an agent is allowed to choose multiple items at a single time step and wishes to control the risk over the whole time horizon.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hou23d	Yunlong Hou, Vincent Y.

Sparse Learning of Dynamical Systems in RKHS: An Operator-Theoretic Approach	Transfer operators provide a rich framework for representing the dynamics of very general, nonlinear dynamical systems. When interacting with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), descriptions of dynamics often incur prohibitive data storage requirements, motivating dataset sparsification as a precursory step to computation. Further, in practice, data is available in the form of trajectories, introducing correlation between samples. In this work, we present a method for sparse learning of transfer operators from $\beta$-mixing stochastic processes, in both discrete and continuous time, and provide sample complexity analysis extending existing theoretical guarantees for learning from non-sparse, i.i.d. data. In addressing continuous-time settings, we develop precise descriptions using covariance-type operators for the infinitesimal generator that aids in the sample complexity analysis. We empirically illustrate the efficacy of our sparse embedding approach through deterministic and stochastic nonlinear system examples.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hou23c	Boya Hou, Sina Sanjari, Nathan Dahlin, Subhonmesh Bose, Umesh Vaidya
PromptBoosting: Black-Box Text Classification with Ten Forward Passes	"We describe PromptBoosting, a query-efficient procedure for building a text classifier from a neural language model (LM) without access to the LM's parameters, gradients, or hidden representations. This form of ""black-box"" classifier training has become increasingly important as the cost of training and inference in large-scale LMs has grown. But existing black-box LM classifier learning approaches are themselves computationally inefficient, typically specializing LMs to the target task by searching in a large space of (discrete or continuous) prompts using zeroth-order optimization methods. Instead of directly optimizing in prompt space, PromptBoosting obtains a small pool of prompts via a gradient-free approach and then constructs a large pool of weak learners by pairing these prompts with different elements of the LM's output distribution. These weak learners are then ensembled using the AdaBoost algorithm. The entire learning process requires only a small number of forward passes and no backward pass. Experiments show that PromptBoosting achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple black-box few-shot classification tasks, and matches or outperforms full fine-tuning in both few-shot and standard learning paradigms, while training 10x faster than existing black-box methods."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hou23b	Bairu Hou, Joe O’Connor, Jacob Andreas, Shiyu Chang, Yang Zhang
Decoding Layer Saliency in Language Transformers	In this paper, we introduce a strategy for identifying textual saliency in large-scale language models applied to classification tasks. In visual networks where saliency is more well-studied, saliency is naturally localized through the convolutional layers of the network; however, the same is not true in modern transformer-stack networks used to process natural language. We adapt gradient-based saliency methods for these networks, propose a method for evaluating the degree of semantic coherence of each layer, and demonstrate consistent improvement over numerous other methods for textual saliency on multiple benchmark classification datasets. Our approach requires no additional training or access to labelled data, and is comparatively very computationally efficient.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hou23a	Elizabeth Mary Hou, Gregory David Castanon
Approximation Algorithms for Fair Range Clustering	This paper studies the fair range clustering problem in which the data points are from different demographic groups and the goal is to pick $k$ centers with the minimum clustering cost such that each group is at least minimally represented in the centers set and no group dominates the centers set. More precisely, given a set of $n$ points in a metric space $(P, d)$ where each point belongs to one of the $\ell$ different demographics (i.e., $P = P_1 \uplus P_2 \uplus \cdots \uplus P_\ell$) and a set of $\ell$ intervals $[\alpha_1, \beta_1], \cdots, [\alpha_\ell, \beta_\ell]$ on desired number of centers from each group, the goal is to pick a set of $k$ centers $C$ with minimum $\ell_p$-clustering cost (i.e., $(\sum_{v\in P} d(v,C)^p)^{1/p}$) such that for each group $i\in \ell$, $|C\cap P_i| \in [\alpha_i, \beta_i]$. In particular, the fair range $\ell_p$-clustering captures fair range $k$-center, $k$-median and $k$-means as its special cases. In this work, we provide an efficient constant factor approximation algorithm for the fair range $\ell_p$-clustering for all values of $p\in [1,\infty)$.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hotegni23a	Sedjro Salomon Hotegni, Sepideh Mahabadi, Ali Vakilian
Fair and Accurate Decision Making through Group-Aware Learning	The integration of machine learning models in various real-world applications is becoming more prevalent to assist humans in their daily decision-making tasks as a result of recent advancements in this field. However, it has been discovered that there is a tradeoff between the accuracy and fairness of these decision-making tasks. In some cases, these AI systems can be unfair by exhibiting bias or discrimination against certain social groups, which can have severe consequences in real life. Inspired by one of the most well-known human learning skills called grouping, we address this issue by proposing a novel machine learning (ML) framework where the ML model learns to group a diverse set of problems into distinct subgroups to solve each subgroup using its specific sub-model. Our proposed framework involves three stages of learning, which are formulated as a three-level optimization problem: 1) grouping problems into subgroups, 2) learning group-specific sub-models for problem-solving, and 3) updating group assignments of training examples by minimizing validation loss. These three learning stages are performed end-to-end in a joint manner using gradient descent. To improve fairness and accuracy, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm to solve this three-level optimization problem. To further decrease the risk of overfitting in small datasets using our LBG method, we incorporate domain adaptation techniques in the second stage of training. We further apply our method to differentiable neural architecture search (NAS) methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hosseini23a	Ramtin Hosseini, Li Zhang, Bhanu Garg, Pengtao Xie
Causal Strategic Classification: A Tale of Two Shifts	"When users can benefit from certain predictive outcomes, they may be prone to act to achieve those outcome, e.g., by strategically modifying their features. The goal in strategic classification is therefore to train predictive models that are robust to such behavior. However, the conventional framework assumes that changing features does not change actual outcomes, which depicts users as ""gaming"" the system. Here we remove this assumption, and study learning in a causal strategic setting where true outcomes do change. Focusing on accuracy as our primary objective, we show how strategic behavior and causal effects underlie two complementing forms of distribution shift. We characterize these shifts, and propose a learning algorithm that balances between these two forces and over time, and permits end-to-end training. Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic data demonstrate the utility of our approach."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/horowitz23a	Guy Horowitz, Nir Rosenfeld
simple diffusion: End-to-end diffusion for high resolution images	Currently, applying diffusion models in pixel space of high resolution images is difficult. Instead, existing approaches focus on diffusion in lower dimensional spaces (latent diffusion), or have multiple super-resolution levels of generation referred to as cascades. The downside is that these approaches add additional complexity to the diffusion framework. This paper aims to improve denoising diffusion for high resolution images while keeping the model as simple as possible. The paper is centered around the research question: How can one train a standard denoising diffusion models on high resolution images, and still obtain performance comparable to these alternate approaches? The four main findings are: 1) the noise schedule should be adjusted for high resolution images, 2) It is sufficient to scale only a particular part of the architecture, 3) dropout should be added at specific locations in the architecture, and 4) downsampling is an effective strategy to avoid high resolution feature maps. Combining these simple yet effective techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art on image generation among diffusion models without sampling modifiers on ImageNet.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hoogeboom23a	Emiel Hoogeboom, Jonathan Heek, Tim Salimans
Revisiting Data-Free Knowledge Distillation with Poisoned Teachers	Data-free knowledge distillation (KD) helps transfer knowledge from a pre-trained model (known as the teacher model) to a smaller model (known as the student model) without access to the original training data used for training the teacher model. However, the security of the synthetic or out-of-distribution (OOD) data required in data-free KD is largely unknown and under-explored. In this work, we make the first effort to uncover the security risk of data-free KD w.r.t. untrusted pre-trained models. We then propose Anti-Backdoor Data-Free KD (ABD), the first plug-in defensive method for data-free KD methods to mitigate the chance of potential backdoors being transferred. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed ABD in diminishing transferred backdoor knowledge while maintaining compatible downstream performances as the vanilla KD. We envision this work as a milestone for alarming and mitigating the potential backdoors in data-free KD. Codes are released at https://github.com/illidanlab/ABD .	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hong23c	Junyuan Hong, Yi Zeng, Shuyang Yu, Lingjuan Lyu, Ruoxi Jia, Jiayu Zhou
Constrained Optimization via Exact Augmented Lagrangian and Randomized Iterative Sketching	We consider solving equality-constrained nonlinear, nonconvex optimization problems. This class of problems appears widely in a variety of applications in machine learning and engineering, ranging from constrained deep neural networks, to optimal control, to PDE-constrained optimization. We develop an adaptive inexact Newton method for this problem class. In each iteration, we solve the Lagrangian Newton system inexactly via a randomized iterative sketching solver, and select a suitable stepsize by performing line search on an exact augmented Lagrangian merit function. The randomized solvers have advantages over deterministic linear system solvers by significantly reducing per-iteration flops complexity and storage cost, when equipped with suitable sketching matrices. Our method adaptively controls the accuracy of the randomized solver and the penalty parameters of the exact augmented Lagrangian, to ensure that the inexact Newton direction is a descent direction of the exact augmented Lagrangian. This allows us to establish a global almost sure convergence. We also show that a unit stepsize is admissible locally, so that our method exhibits a local linear convergence. Furthermore, we prove that the linear convergence can be strengthened to superlinear convergence if we gradually sharpen the adaptive accuracy condition on the randomized solver. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method on benchmark nonlinear problems in CUTEst test set, constrained logistic regression with data from LIBSVM, and a PDE-constrained problem.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hong23b	Ilgee Hong, Sen Na, Michael W.

Multi-Task Off-Policy Learning from Bandit Feedback	Many practical problems involve solving similar tasks. In recommender systems, the tasks can be users with similar preferences; in search engines, the tasks can be items with similar affinities. To learn statistically efficiently, the tasks can be organized in a hierarchy, where the task affinity is captured using an unknown latent parameter. We study the problem of off-policy learning for similar tasks from logged bandit feedback. To solve the problem, we propose a hierarchical off-policy optimization algorithm HierOPO. The key idea is to estimate the task parameters using the hierarchy and then act pessimistically with respect to them. To analyze the algorithm, we develop novel Bayesian error bounds. Our bounds are the first in off-policy learning that improve with a more informative prior and capture statistical gains due to hierarchical models. Therefore, they are of a general interest. HierOPO also performs well in practice. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of using the hierarchy over solving each task independently.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hong23a	Joey Hong, Branislav Kveton, Manzil Zaheer, Sumeet Katariya, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh
Dual Propagation: Accelerating Contrastive Hebbian Learning with Dyadic Neurons	Activity difference based learning algorithms—such as contrastive Hebbian learning and equilibrium propagation—have been proposed as biologically plausible alternatives to error back-propagation. However, on traditional digital chips these algorithms suffer from having to solve a costly inference problem twice, making these approaches more than two orders of magnitude slower than back-propagation. In the analog realm equilibrium propagation may be promising for fast and energy efficient learning, but states still need to be inferred and stored twice. Inspired by lifted neural networks and compartmental neuron models we propose a simple energy based compartmental neuron model, termed dual propagation, in which each neuron is a dyad with two intrinsic states. At inference time these intrinsic states encode the error/activity duality through their difference and their mean respectively. The advantage of this method is that only a single inference phase is needed and that inference can be solved in layerwise closed-form. Experimentally we show on common computer vision datasets, including Imagenet32x32, that dual propagation performs equivalently to back-propagation both in terms of accuracy and runtime.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hoier23a	Rasmus Høier, D.

AdaBoost is not an Optimal Weak to Strong Learner	AdaBoost is a classic boosting algorithm for combining multiple inaccurate classifiers produced by a weak learner, to produce a strong learner with arbitrarily high accuracy when given enough training data. Determining the optimal number of samples necessary to obtain a given accuracy of the strong learner, is a basic learning theoretic question. Larsen and Ritzert (NeurIPS'22) recently presented the first provably optimal weak-to-strong learner. However, their algorithm is somewhat complicated and it remains an intriguing question whether the prototypical boosting algorithm AdaBoost also makes optimal use of training samples. In this work, we answer this question in the negative. Concretely, we show that the sample complexity of AdaBoost, and other classic variations thereof, are sub-optimal by at least one logarithmic factor in the desired accuracy of the strong learner.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hogsgaard23a	Mikael Møller Høgsgaard, Kasper Green Larsen, Martin Ritzert

Generalized Teacher Forcing for Learning Chaotic Dynamics	Chaotic dynamical systems (DS) are ubiquitous in nature and society. Often we are interested in reconstructing such systems from observed time series for prediction or mechanistic insight, where by reconstruction we mean learning geometrical and invariant temporal properties of the system in question (like attractors). However, training reconstruction algorithms like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on such systems by gradient-descent based techniques faces severe challenges. This is mainly due to exploding gradients caused by the exponential divergence of trajectories in chaotic systems. Moreover, for (scientific) interpretability we wish to have as low dimensional reconstructions as possible, preferably in a model which is mathematically tractable. Here we report that a surprisingly simple modification of teacher forcing leads to provably strictly all-time bounded gradients in training on chaotic systems, and, when paired with a simple architectural rearrangement of a tractable RNN design, piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs), allows for faithful reconstruction in spaces of at most the dimensionality of the observed system. We show on several DS that with these amendments we can reconstruct DS better than current SOTA algorithms, in much lower dimensions. Performance differences were particularly compelling on real world data with which most other methods severely struggled. This work thus led to a simple yet powerful DS reconstruction algorithm which is highly interpretable at the same time.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hess23a	Florian Hess, Zahra Monfared, Manuel Brenner, Daniel Durstewitz
Robust Camera Pose Refinement for Multi-Resolution Hash Encoding	Multi-resolution hash encoding has recently been proposed to reduce the computational cost of neural renderings, such as NeRF. This method requires accurate camera poses for the neural renderings of given scenes. However, contrary to previous methods jointly optimizing camera poses and 3D scenes, the naive gradient-based camera pose refinement method using multi-resolution hash encoding severely deteriorates performance. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to calibrate the camera pose and learn a geometric representation using efficient multi-resolution hash encoding. Showing that the oscillating gradient flows of hash encoding interfere with the registration of camera poses, our method addresses the issue by utilizing smooth interpolation weighting to stabilize the gradient oscillation for the ray samplings across hash grids. Moreover, the curriculum training procedure helps to learn the level-wise hash encoding, further increasing the pose refinement. Experiments on the novel-view synthesis datasets validate that our learning frameworks achieve state-of-the-art performance and rapid convergence of neural rendering.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/heo23a	Hwan Heo, Taekyung Kim, Jiyoung Lee, Jaewon Lee, Soohyun Kim, Hyunwoo J.

A Study of Global and Episodic Bonuses for Exploration in Contextual MDPs	Exploration in environments which differ across episodes has received increasing attention in recent years. Current methods use some combination of global novelty bonuses, computed using the agent's entire training experience, and episodic novelty bonuses, computed using only experience from the current episode. However, the use of these two types of bonuses has been ad-hoc and poorly understood. In this work, we shed light on the behavior of these two types of bonuses through controlled experiments on easily interpretable tasks as well as challenging pixel-based settings. We find that the two types of bonuses succeed in different settings, with episodic bonuses being most effective when there is little shared structure across episodes and global bonuses being effective when more structure is shared. We develop a conceptual framework which makes this notion of shared structure precise by considering the variance of the value function across contexts, and which provides a unifying explanation of our empirical results. We furthermore find that combining the two bonuses can lead to more robust performance across different degrees of shared structure, and investigate different algorithmic choices for defining and combining global and episodic bonuses based on function approximation. This results in an algorithm which sets a new state of the art across 16 tasks from the MiniHack suite used in prior work, and also performs robustly on Habitat and Montezuma's Revenge.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/henaff23a	Mikael Henaff, Minqi Jiang, Roberta Raileanu
Training-Free Neural Active Learning with Initialization-Robustness Guarantees	Existing neural active learning algorithms have aimed to optimize the predictive performance of neural networks (NNs) by selecting data for labelling. However, other than a good predictive performance, being robust against random parameter initializations is also a crucial requirement in safety-critical applications. To this end, we introduce our expected variance with Gaussian processes (EV-GP) criterion for neural active learning, which is theoretically guaranteed to select data points which lead to trained NNs with both (a) good predictive performances and (b) initialization robustness. Importantly, our EV-GP criterion is training-free, i.e., it does not require any training of the NN during data selection, which makes it computationally efficient. We empirically demonstrate that our EV-GP criterion is highly correlated with both initialization robustness and generalization performance, and show that it consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of both desiderata, especially in situations with limited initial data or large batch sizes.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hemachandra23a	Apivich Hemachandra, Zhongxiang Dai, Jasraj Singh, See-Kiong Ng, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low
Group Equivariant Fourier Neural Operators for Partial Differential Equations	We consider solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with Fourier neural operators (FNOs), which operate in the frequency domain. Since the laws of physics do not depend on the coordinate system used to describe them, it is desirable to encode such symmetries in the neural operator architecture for better performance and easier learning. While encoding symmetries in the physical domain using group theory has been studied extensively, how to capture symmetries in the frequency domain is under-explored. In this work, we extend group convolutions to the frequency domain and design Fourier layers that are equivariant to rotations, translations, and reflections by leveraging the equivariance property of the Fourier transform. The resulting $G$-FNO architecture generalizes well across input resolutions and performs well in settings with varying levels of symmetry. Our code is publicly available as part of the AIRS library (https://github.com/divelab/AIRS).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/helwig23a	Jacob Helwig, Xuan Zhang, Cong Fu, Jerry Kurtin, Stephan Wojtowytsch, Shuiwang Ji
Distance Weighted Supervised Learning for Offline Interaction Data	Sequential decision making algorithms often struggle to leverage different sources of unstructured offline interaction data. Imitation learning (IL) methods based on supervised learning are robust, but require optimal demonstrations, which are hard to collect. Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms promise to learn from sub-optimal data, but face optimization challenges especially with high-dimensional data. To bridge the gap between IL and RL, we introduce Distance Weighted Supervised Learning or DWSL, a supervised method for learning goal-conditioned policies from offline data. DWSL models the entire distribution of time-steps between states in offline data with only supervised learning, and uses this distribution to approximate shortest path distances. To extract a policy, we weight actions by their reduction in distance estimates. Theoretically, DWSL converges to an optimal policy constrained to the data distribution, an attractive property for offline learning, without any bootstrapping. Across all datasets we test, DWSL empirically maintains behavior cloning as a lower bound while still exhibiting policy improvement. In high-dimensional image domains, DWSL surpasses the performance of both prior goal-conditioned IL and RL algorithms. Visualizations and code can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/dwsl/home.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hejna23a	Joey Hejna, Jensen Gao, Dorsa Sadigh
Functional Neural Networks: Shift invariant models for functional data with applications to EEG classification	It is desirable for statistical models to detect signals of interest independently of their position. If the data is generated by some smooth process, this additional structure should be taken into account. We introduce a new class of neural networks that are shift invariant and preserve smoothness of the data: functional neural networks (FNNs). For this, we use methods from functional data analysis (FDA) to extend multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks to functional data. We propose different model architectures, show that the models outperform a benchmark model from FDA in terms of accuracy and successfully use FNNs to classify electroencephalography (EEG) data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/heinrichs23a	Florian Heinrichs, Mavin Heim, Corinna Weber
Sketch-Flip-Merge: Mergeable Sketches for Private Distinct Counting	Data sketching is a critical tool for distinct counting, enabling multisets to be represented by compact summaries that admit fast cardinality estimates. Because sketches may be merged to summarize multiset unions, they are a basic building block in data warehouses. Although many practical sketches for cardinality estimation exist, none provide privacy when merging. We propose the first practical cardinality sketches that are simultaneously mergeable, differentially private (DP), and have low empirical errors. These introduce a novel randomized algorithm for performing logical operations on noisy bits, a tight privacy analysis, and provably optimal estimation. Our sketches dramatically outperform existing theoretical solutions in simulations and on real-world data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hehir23a	Jonathan Hehir, Daniel Ting, Graham Cormode
CRISP: Curriculum based Sequential neural decoders for Polar code family	Polar codes are widely used state-of-the-art codes for reliable communication that have recently been included in the $5^{\text{th}}$ generation wireless standards ($5$G). However, there still remains room for design of polar decoders that are both efficient and reliable in the short blocklength regime. Motivated by recent successes of data-driven channel decoders, we introduce a novel $\textbf{ C}$ur${\textbf{RI}}$culum based $\textbf{S}$equential neural decoder for $\textbf{P}$olar codes (CRISP). We design a principled curriculum, guided by information-theoretic insights, to train CRISP and show that it outperforms the successive-cancellation (SC) decoder and attains near-optimal reliability performance on the $\text{Polar}(32,16)$ and $\text{Polar}(64,22)$ codes. The choice of the proposed curriculum is critical in achieving the accuracy gains of CRISP, as we show by comparing against other curricula. More notably, CRISP can be readily extended to Polarization-Adjusted-Convolutional (PAC) codes, where existing SC decoders are significantly less reliable. To the best of our knowledge, CRISP constructs the first data-driven decoder for PAC codes and attains near-optimal performance on the $\text{PAC}(32,16)$ code.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hebbar23a	S Ashwin Hebbar, Viraj Vivek Nadkarni, Ashok Vardhan Makkuva, Suma Bhat, Sewoong Oh, Pramod Viswanath
Nearly Minimax Optimal Reinforcement Learning for Linear Markov Decision Processes	We study reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation. For episodic time-inhomogeneous linear Markov decision processes (linear MDPs) whose transition probability can be parameterized as a linear function of a given feature mapping, we propose the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves the nearly minimax optimal regret $\tilde O(d\sqrt{H^3K})$, where $d$ is the dimension of the feature mapping, $H$ is the planning horizon, and $K$ is the number of episodes. Our algorithm is based on a weighted linear regression scheme with a carefully designed weight, which depends on a new variance estimator that (1) directly estimates the variance of the	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/he23d	Jiafan He, Heyang Zhao, Dongruo Zhou, Quanquan Gu
Contrastive Learning Meets Homophily: Two Birds with One Stone	Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has recently enjoyed great success as an efficient self-supervised representation learning approach. However, the existing methods have focused on designing of contrastive modes and used data augmentation with a rigid and inefficient one-to-one sampling strategy. We adopted node neighborhoods to extend positive samplings and made avoided resorting to data augmentation to create different views. We also considered the homophily problem in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) between the inter-class node pairs. The key novelty of our method hinged upon analyzing this GNNs problem and integrating the GCL sampling strategy with homophily discrimination, where we solved these two significant problems using one approach. We introduced a new parameterized neighbor sampling component to replace the conventional sub-optimal samplings. By keeping and updating the neighbor sets, both the positive sampling of GCL and the message passing of GNNs can be optimized. Moreover, we theoretically proved that the new method provided a lower bound of mutual information for unsupervised semantic learning, and it can also keep the lower bound with downstream tasks. In essence, our method is a new self-supervised approach, which we refer to as group discrimination, and it can make the downstream fine-tuning efficient. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that the new method can significantly outperform the existing GCL methods because the former can solve the homophily problem in a self-supervised way with the new group discrimination method used.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/he23c	Dongxiao He, Jitao Zhao, Rui Guo, Zhiyong Feng, Di Jin, Yuxiao Huang, Zhen Wang, Weixiong Zhang
Domain Adaptation for Time Series Under Feature and Label Shifts	Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables the transfer of models trained on source domains to unlabeled target domains. However, transferring complex time series models presents challenges due to the dynamic temporal structure variations across domains. This leads to feature shifts in the time and frequency representations. Additionally, the label distributions of tasks in the source and target domains can differ significantly, posing difficulties in addressing label shifts and recognizing labels unique to the target domain. Effectively transferring complex time series models remains a formidable problem. We present RAINCOAT, the first model for both closed-set and universal domain adaptation on complex time series. RAINCOAT addresses feature and label shifts by considering both temporal and frequency features, aligning them across domains, and correcting for misalignments to facilitate the detection of private labels. Additionally, RAINCOAT improves transferability by identifying label shifts in target domains. Our experiments with 5 datasets and 13 state-of-the-art UDA methods demonstrate that RAINCOAT can improve transfer learning performance by up to 16.33% and can handle both closed-set and universal domain adaptation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/he23b	Huan He, Owen Queen, Teddy Koker, Consuelo Cuevas, Theodoros Tsiligkaridis, Marinka Zitnik
A Generalization of ViT/MLP-Mixer to Graphs	Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in the field of graph representation learning. Standard GNNs define a local message-passing mechanism which propagates information over the whole graph domain by stacking multiple layers. This paradigm suffers from two major limitations, over-squashing and poor long-range dependencies, that can be solved using global attention but significantly increases the computational cost to quadratic complexity. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to overcome these structural limitations by leveraging the ViT/MLP-Mixer architectures introduced in computer vision. We introduce a new class of GNNs, called Graph ViT/MLP-Mixer, that holds three key properties. First, they capture long-range dependency and mitigate the issue of over-squashing as demonstrated on Long Range Graph Benchmark and TreeNeighbourMatch datasets. Second, they offer better speed and memory efficiency with a complexity linear to the number of nodes and edges, surpassing the related Graph Transformer and expressive GNN models. Third, they show high expressivity in terms of graph isomorphism as they can distinguish at least 3-WL non-isomorphic graphs. We test our architecture on 4 simulated datasets and 7 real-world benchmarks, and show highly competitive results on all of them. The source code is available for reproducibility at: https://github.com/XiaoxinHe/Graph-ViT-MLPMixer.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/he23a	Xiaoxin He, Bryan Hooi, Thomas Laurent, Adam Perold, Yann Lecun, Xavier Bresson
Width and Depth Limits Commute in Residual Networks	We show that taking the width and depth to infinity in a deep neural network with skip connections, when branches are scaled by $1/\sqrt{depth}$, result in the same covariance structure no matter how that limit is taken. This explains why the standard infinite-width-then-depth approach provides practical insights even for networks with depth of the same order as width. We also demonstrate that the pre-activations, in this case, have Gaussian distributions which has direct applications in Bayesian deep learning. We conduct extensive simulations that show an excellent match with our theoretical findings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hayou23a	Soufiane Hayou, Greg Yang
Sampling-based Nyström Approximation and Kernel Quadrature	We analyze the Nyström approximation of a positive definite kernel associated with a probability measure. We first prove an improved error bound for the conventional Nyström approximation with i.i.d. sampling and singular-value decomposition in the continuous regime; the proof techniques are borrowed from statistical learning theory. We further introduce a refined selection of subspaces in Nyström approximation with theoretical guarantees that is applicable to non-i.i.d. landmark points. Finally, we discuss their application to convex kernel quadrature and give novel theoretical guarantees as well as numerical observations.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hayakawa23a	Satoshi Hayakawa, Harald Oberhauser, Terry Lyons
Counterfactual Analysis in Dynamic Latent State Models	"We provide an optimization-based framework to perform counterfactual analysis in a dynamic model with hidden states. Our framework is grounded in the ""abduction, action, and prediction"" approach to answer counterfactual queries and handles two key challenges where (1) the states are hidden and (2) the model is dynamic. Recognizing the lack of knowledge on the underlying causal mechanism and the possibility of infinitely many such mechanisms, we optimize over this space and compute upper and lower bounds on the counterfactual quantity of interest. Our work brings together ideas from causality, state-space models, simulation, and optimization, and we apply it on a breast cancer case study. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to compute lower and upper bounds on a counterfactual query in a dynamic latent-state model."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/haugh23a	Martin B Haugh, Raghav Singal
Global Context Vision Transformers	We propose global context vision transformer (GC ViT), a novel architecture that enhances parameter and compute utilization for computer vision. Our method leverages global context self-attention modules, joint with standard local self-attention, to effectively and efficiently model both long and short-range spatial interactions, without the need for expensive operations such as computing attention masks or shifting local windows. In addition, we address the lack of the inductive bias in ViTs, and propose to leverage a modified fused inverted residual blocks in our architecture. Our proposed GC ViT achieves state-of-the-art results across image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. On ImageNet-1K dataset for classification, the variants of GC ViT with 51M, 90M and 201M parameters achieve 84.3%, 85.0% and 85.7% Top-1 accuracy, respectively, at 224 image resolution and without any pre-training, hence surpassing comparably-sized prior art such as CNN-based ConvNeXt and ViT-based MaxViT and Swin Transformer by a large margin. Pre-trained GC ViT backbones in downstream tasks of object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation using MS COCO and ADE20K datasets outperform prior work consistently. Specifically, GC ViT with a 4-scale DINO detection head achieves a box AP of 58.3 on MS COCO dataset.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hatamizadeh23a	Ali Hatamizadeh, Hongxu Yin, Greg Heinrich, Jan Kautz, Pavlo Molchanov
Theoretical Guarantees of Learning Ensembling Strategies with Applications to Time Series Forecasting	"Ensembling is among the most popular tools in machine learning (ML) due to its effectiveness in minimizing variance and thus improving generalization. Most ensembling methods for black-box base learners fall under the umbrella of ""stacked generalization,"" namely training an ML algorithm that takes the inferences from the base learners as input. While stacking has been widely applied in practice, its theoretical properties are poorly understood. In this paper, we prove a novel result, showing that choosing the best stacked generalization from a (finite or finite-dimensional) family of stacked generalizations based on cross-validated performance does not perform ""much worse"" than the oracle best. Our result strengthens and significantly extends the results in Van der Laan et al. (2007). Inspired by the theoretical analysis, we further propose a particular family of stacked generalizations in the context of probabilistic forecasting, each one with a different sensitivity for how much the ensemble weights are allowed to vary across items, timestamps in the forecast horizon, and quantiles. Experimental results demonstrate the performance gain of the proposed method."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hasson23a	Hilaf Hasson, Danielle C. Maddix, Bernie Wang, Gaurav Gupta, Youngsuk Park
Gaussian Process Priors for Systems of Linear Partial Differential Equations with Constant Coefficients	Partial differential equations (PDEs) are important tools to model physical systems and including them into machine learning models is an important way of incorporating physical knowledge. Given any system of linear PDEs with constant coefficients, we propose a family of Gaussian process (GP) priors, which we call EPGP, such that all realizations are exact solutions of this system. We apply the Ehrenpreis-Palamodov fundamental principle, which works as a non-linear Fourier transform, to construct GP kernels mirroring standard spectral methods for GPs. Our approach can infer probable solutions of linear PDE systems from any data such as noisy measurements, or pointwise defined initial and boundary conditions. Constructing EPGP-priors is algorithmic, generally applicable, and comes with a sparse version (S-EPGP) that learns the relevant spectral frequencies and works better for big data sets. We demonstrate our approach on three families of systems of PDEs, the heat equation, wave equation, and Maxwell's equations, where we improve upon the state of the art in computation time and precision, in some experiments by several orders of magnitude.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/harkonen23a	Marc Harkonen, Markus Lange-Hegermann, Bogdan Raita
Algorithmic Collective Action in Machine Learning	We initiate a principled study of algorithmic collective action on digital platforms that deploy machine learning algorithms. We propose a simple theoretical model of a collective interacting with a firm's learning algorithm. The collective pools the data of participating individuals and executes an algorithmic strategy by instructing participants how to modify their own data to achieve a collective goal. We investigate the consequences of this model in three fundamental learning-theoretic settings: nonparametric optimal learning, parametric risk minimization, and gradient-based optimization. In each setting, we come up with coordinated algorithmic strategies and characterize natural success criteria as a function of the collective's size. Complementing our theory, we conduct systematic experiments on a skill classification task involving tens of thousands of resumes from a gig platform for freelancers. Through more than two thousand model training runs of a BERT-like language model, we see a striking correspondence emerge between our empirical observations and the predictions made by our theory. Taken together, our theory and experiments broadly support the conclusion that algorithmic collectives of exceedingly small fractional size can exert significant control over a platform's learning algorithm.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hardt23a	Moritz Hardt, Eric Mazumdar, Celestine Mendler-Dünner, Tijana Zrnic
GNOT: A General Neural Operator Transformer for Operator Learning	Learning partial differential equations' (PDEs) solution operators is an essential problem in machine learning. However, there are several challenges for learning operators in practical applications like the irregular mesh, multiple input functions, and complexity of the PDEs' solution. To address these challenges, we propose a general neural operator transformer (GNOT), a scalable and effective transformer-based framework for learning operators. By designing a novel heterogeneous normalized attention layer, our model is highly flexible to handle multiple input functions and irregular meshes. Besides, we introduce a geometric gating mechanism which could be viewed as a soft domain decomposition to solve the multi-scale problems. The large model capacity of the transformer architecture grants our model the possibility to scale to large datasets and practical problems. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets from different domains and achieve a remarkable improvement compared with alternative methods. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-ml/GNOT.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hao23c	Zhongkai Hao, Zhengyi Wang, Hang Su, Chengyang Ying, Yinpeng Dong, Songming Liu, Ze Cheng, Jian Song, Jun Zhu
Coupled Variational Autoencoder	Variational auto-encoders are powerful probabilistic models in generative tasks but suffer from generating low-quality samples which are caused by the holes in the prior. We propose the Coupled Variational Auto-Encoder (C-VAE), which formulates the VAE problem as one of Optimal Transport (OT) between the prior and data distributions. The C-VAE allows greater flexibility in priors and natural resolution of the prior hole problem by enforcing coupling between the prior and the data distribution and enables flexible optimization through the primal, dual, and semi-dual formulations of entropic OT. Simulations on synthetic and real data show that the C-VAE outperforms alternatives including VAE, WAE, and InfoVAE in fidelity to the data, quality of the latent representation, and in quality of generated samples.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hao23b	Xiaoran Hao, Patrick Shafto

On Pre-Training for Visuo-Motor Control: Revisiting a Learning-from-Scratch Baseline	In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of pre-training for visuo-motor control tasks. We revisit a simple Learning-from-Scratch (LfS) baseline that incorporates data augmentation and a shallow ConvNet, and find that this baseline is surprisingly competitive with recent approaches (PVR, MVP, R3M) that leverage frozen visual representations trained on large-scale vision datasets – across a variety of algorithms, task domains, and metrics in simulation and on a real robot. Our results demonstrate that these methods are hindered by a significant domain gap between the pre-training datasets and current benchmarks for visuo-motor control, which is alleviated by finetuning. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for future research in pre-training for control and hope that our simple yet strong baseline will aid in accurately benchmarking progress in this area.

Learning Physical Models that Can Respect Conservation Laws	"Recent work in scientific machine learning (SciML) has focused on incorporating partial differential equation (PDE) information into the learning process. Much of this work has focused on relatively ""easy"" PDE operators (e.g., elliptic and parabolic), with less emphasis on relatively ""hard"" PDE operators (e.g., hyperbolic). Within numerical PDEs, the latter problem class requires control of a type of volume element or conservation constraint, which is known to be challenging. Delivering on the promise of SciML requires seamlessly incorporating both types of problems into the learning process. To address this issue, we propose ProbConserv, a framework for incorporating constraints into a generic SciML architecture. To do so, ProbConserv combines the integral form of a conservation law with a Bayesian update. We provide a detailed analysis of ProbConserv on learning with the Generalized Porous Medium Equation (GPME), a widely-applicable parameterized family of PDEs that illustrates the qualitative properties of both easier and harder PDEs. ProbConserv is effective for easy GPME variants, performing well with state-of-the-art competitors; and for harder GPME variants it outperforms other approaches that do not guarantee volume conservation. ProbConserv seamlessly enforces physical conservation constraints, maintains probabilistic uncertainty quantification (UQ), and deals well with shocks and heteroscedasticity. In each case, it achieves superior predictive performance on downstream tasks."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hansen23b	Derek Hansen, Danielle C. Maddix, Shima Alizadeh, Gaurav Gupta, Michael W.

Total Variation Graph Neural Networks	Recently proposed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for vertex clustering are trained with an unsupervised minimum cut objective, approximated by a Spectral Clustering (SC) relaxation. However, the SC relaxation is loose and, while it offers a closed-form solution, it also yields overly smooth cluster assignments that poorly separate the vertices. In this paper, we propose a GNN model that computes cluster assignments by optimizing a tighter relaxation of the minimum cut based on graph total variation (GTV). The cluster assignments can be used directly to perform vertex clustering or to implement graph pooling in a graph classification framework. Our model consists of two core components: i) a message-passing layer that minimizes the $\ell_1$ distance in the features of adjacent vertices, which is key to achieving sharp transitions between clusters; ii) an unsupervised loss function that minimizes the GTV of the cluster assignments while ensuring balanced partitions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms other GNNs for vertex clustering and graph classification.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/hansen23a	Jonas Berg Hansen, Filippo Maria Bianchi
System Identification of Neural Systems: If We Got It Right, Would We Know?	Artificial neural networks are being proposed as models of parts of the brain. The networks are compared to recordings of biological neurons, and good performance in reproducing neural responses is considered to support the model's validity. A key question is how much this system identification approach tells us about brain computation. Does it validate one model architecture over another? We evaluate the most commonly used comparison techniques, such as a linear encoding model and centered kernel alignment, to correctly identify a model by replacing brain recordings with known ground truth models. System identification performance is quite variable; it also depends significantly on factors independent of the ground truth architecture, such as stimuli images. In addition, we show the limitations of using functional similarity scores in identifying higher-level architectural motifs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/han23d	Yena Han, Tomaso A Poggio, Brian Cheung
Alternately Optimized Graph Neural Networks	Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have greatly advanced the semi-supervised node classification task on graphs. The majority of existing GNNs are trained in an end-to-end manner that can be viewed as tackling a bi-level optimization problem. This process is often inefficient in computation and memory usage. In this work, we propose a new optimization framework for semi-supervised learning on graphs from a multi-view learning perspective. The proposed framework can be conveniently solved by the alternating optimization algorithms, resulting in significantly improved efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve comparable or better performance with state-of-the-art baselines while it has significantly better computation and memory efficiency.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/han23c	Haoyu Han, Xiaorui Liu, Haitao Mao, Mohamadali Torkamani, Feng Shi, Victor Lee, Jiliang Tang
On the Impact of Knowledge Distillation for Model Interpretability	Several recent studies have elucidated why knowledge distillation (KD) improves model performance. However, few have researched the other advantages of KD in addition to its improving model performance. In this study, we have attempted to show that KD enhances the interpretability as well as the accuracy of models. We measured the number of concept detectors identified in network dissection for a quantitative comparison of model interpretability. We attributed the improvement in interpretability to the class-similarity information transferred from the teacher to student models. First, we confirmed the transfer of class-similarity information from the teacher to student model via logit distillation. Then, we analyzed how class-similarity information affects model interpretability in terms of its presence or absence and degree of similarity information. We conducted various quantitative and qualitative experiments and examined the results on different datasets, different KD methods, and according to different measures of interpretability. Our research showed that KD models by large models could be used more reliably in various fields.

Wrapped Cauchy Distributed Angular Softmax for Long-Tailed Visual Recognition	Addressing imbalanced or long-tailed data is a major challenge in visual recognition tasks due to disparities between training and testing distributions and issues with data noise. We propose the Wrapped Cauchy Distributed Angular Softmax (WCDAS), a novel softmax function that incorporates data-wise Gaussian-based kernels into the angular correlation between feature representations and classifier weights, effectively mitigating noise and sparse sampling concerns. The class-wise distribution of angular representation becomes a sum of these kernels. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the wrapped Cauchy distribution excels the Gaussian distribution in approximating mixed distributions. Additionally, WCDAS uses trainable concentration parameters to dynamically adjust the compactness and margin of each class. Empirical results confirm label-aware behavior in these parameters and demonstrate WCDAS's superiority over other state-of-the-art softmax-based methods in handling long-tailed visual recognition across multiple benchmark datasets. The code is public available.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/han23a	Boran Han
Robust Counterfactual Explanations for Neural Networks With Probabilistic Guarantees	There is an emerging interest in generating robust counterfactual explanations that would remain valid if the model is updated or changed even slightly.

In particular, the interplay between the radius of the ball and the bias vector is emphasized. Together with a perspective from convex geometry, this leads to a computationally feasible method of verifying the injectivity of a ReLU-layer under reasonable restrictions in terms of an upper bound of the bias vector. Explicit reconstruction formulas are provided, inspired by the duality concept from frame theory. All this gives rise to the possibility of quantifying the invertibility of a ReLU-layer and a concrete reconstruction algorithm for any input vector on the ball.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/haider23a	Daniel Haider, Martin Ehler, Peter Balazs
Social learning spontaneously emerges by searching optimal heuristics with deep reinforcement learning	How have individuals of social animals in nature evolved to learn from each other, and what would be the optimal strategy for such learning in a specific environment? Here, we address both problems by employing a deep reinforcement learning model to optimize the social learning strategies (SLSs) of agents in a cooperative game in a multi-dimensional landscape. Throughout the training for maximizing the overall payoff, we find that the agent spontaneously learns various concepts of social learning, such as copying, focusing on frequent and well-performing neighbors, self-comparison, long-term cooperation between agents, and the importance of balancing between individual and social learning, without any explicit guidance or prior knowledge about the system. The SLS from a fully trained agent outperforms all of the traditional, baseline SLSs in terms of mean payoff. We demonstrate the superior performance of the reinforcement learning agent in various environments, including temporally changing environments and real social networks, which also verifies the adaptability of our framework to different social settings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ha23a	Seungwoong Ha, Hawoong Jeong
Conformal Prediction Sets for Graph Neural Networks	Despite the widespread use of graph neural networks (GNNs) we lack methods to reliably quantify their uncertainty. We propose a conformal procedure to equip GNNs with prediction sets that come with distribution-free guarantees – the output set contains the true label with arbitrarily high probability. Our post-processing procedure can wrap around any (pretrained) GNN, and unlike existing methods, results in meaningful sets even when the model provides only the top class. The key idea is to diffuse the node-wise conformity scores to incorporate neighborhood information. By leveraging the network homophily we construct sets with comparable or better efficiency (average size) and significantly improved singleton hit ratio (correct sets of size one). In addition to an extensive empirical evaluation, we investigate the theoretical conditions under which smoothing provably improves efficiency.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/h-zargarbashi23a	Soroush H.

Kernel Logistic Regression Approximation of an Understandable ReLU Neural Network	This paper proposes an understandable neural network whose score function is modeled as an additive sum of univariate spline functions. It extends usual understandable models like generative additive models, spline-based models, and neural additive models. It is shown that this neural network can be approximated by a logistic regression whose inputs are obtained with a non-linear preprocessing of input data. This preprocessing depends on the neural network initialization but this paper establishes that it can be replaced by a non random kernel-based preprocessing that no longer depends on the initialization. Hence, the convergence of the training process is guaranteed and the solution is unique for a given training dataset.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/guyomard23a	Marie Guyomard, Susana Barbosa, Lionel Fillatre
DRew: Dynamically Rewired Message Passing with Delay	Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have been shown to suffer from the phenomenon of over-squashing that causes poor performance for tasks relying on long-range interactions. This can be largely attributed to message passing only occurring locally, over a node's immediate neighbours. Rewiring approaches attempting to make graphs 'more connected', and supposedly better suited to long-range tasks, often lose the inductive bias provided by distance on the graph since they make distant nodes communicate instantly at every layer. In this paper we propose a framework, applicable to any MPNN architecture, that performs a layer-dependent rewiring to ensure gradual densification of the graph. We also propose a delay mechanism that permits skip connections between nodes depending on the layer and their mutual distance. We validate our approach on several long-range tasks and show that it outperforms graph Transformers and multi-hop MPNNs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gutteridge23a	Benjamin Gutteridge, Xiaowen Dong, Michael M.

Conditionally Strongly Log-Concave Generative Models	There is a growing gap between the impressive results of deep image generative models and classical algorithms that offer theoretical guarantees. The former suffer from mode collapse or memorization issues, limiting their application to scientific data. The latter require restrictive assumptions such as log-concavity to escape the curse of dimensionality. We partially bridge this gap by introducing conditionally strongly log-concave (CSLC) models, which factorize the data distribution into a product of conditional probability distributions that are strongly log-concave. This factorization is obtained with orthogonal projectors adapted to the data distribution. It leads to efficient parameter estimation and sampling algorithms, with theoretical guarantees, although the data distribution is not globally log-concave. We show that several challenging multiscale processes are conditionally log-concave using wavelet packet orthogonal projectors. Numerical results are shown for physical fields such as the $\varphi^4$ model and weak lensing convergence maps with higher resolution than in previous works.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/guth23a	Florentin Guth, Etienne Lempereur, Joan Bruna, Stéphane Mallat
Multi-Task Structural Learning using Local Task Similarity induced Neuron Creation and Removal	Multi-task learning has the potential to improve generalization by maximizing positive transfer between tasks while reducing task interference. Fully achieving this potential is hindered by manually designed architectures that remain static throughout training. On the contrary, learning in the brain occurs through structural changes that are in tandem with changes in synaptic strength. Thus, we propose	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gurulingan23a	Naresh Kumar Gurulingan, Bahram Zonooz, Elahe Arani
Online Platt Scaling with Calibeating	We present an online post-hoc calibration method, called Online Platt Scaling (OPS), which combines the Platt scaling technique with online logistic regression. We demonstrate that OPS smoothly adapts between i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. settings with distribution drift. Further, in scenarios where the best Platt scaling model is itself miscalibrated, we enhance OPS by incorporating a recently developed technique called calibeating to make it more robust. Theoretically, our resulting OPS+calibeating method is guaranteed to be calibrated for adversarial outcome sequences. Empirically, it is effective on a range of synthetic and real-world datasets, with and without distribution drifts, achieving superior performance without hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we extend all OPS ideas to the beta scaling method.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gupta23c	Chirag Gupta, Aaditya Ramdas
GRAFENNE: Learning on Graphs with Heterogeneous and Dynamic Feature Sets	Graph neural networks (GNNs), in general, are built on the assumption of a static set of features characterizing each node in a graph. This assumption is often violated in practice. Existing methods partly address this issue through feature imputation. However, these techniques (i) assume uniformity of feature set across nodes, (ii) are transductive by nature, and (iii) fail to work when features are added or removed over time. In this work, we address these limitations through a novel GNN framework called GRAFENNE. GRAFENNE performs a novel allotropic transformation on the original graph, wherein the nodes and features are decoupled through a bipartite encoding. Through a carefully chosen message passing framework on the allotropic transformation, we make the model parameter size independent of the number of features and thereby inductive to both unseen nodes and features. We prove that GRAFENNE is at least as expressive as any of the existing message-passing GNNs in terms of Weisfeiler-Leman tests, and therefore, the additional inductivity to unseen features does not come at the cost of expressivity. In addition, as demonstrated over four real-world graphs, GRAFENNE empowers the underlying GNN with high empirical efficacy and the ability to learn in continual fashion over streaming feature sets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gupta23b	Shubham Gupta, Sahil Manchanda, Sayan Ranu, Srikanta J.

High-dimensional Location Estimation via Norm Concentration for Subgamma Vectors	In location estimation, we are given $n$ samples from a known distribution $f$ shifted by an unknown translation $\lambda$, and want to estimate $\lambda$ as precisely as possible. Asymptotically, the maximum likelihood estimate achieves the Cramér-Rao bound of error $\mathcal N(0, \frac{1}{n\mathcal I})$, where $\mathcal I$ is the Fisher information of $f$. However, the $n$ required for convergence depends on $f$, and may be arbitrarily large. We build on the theory using	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gupta23a	Shivam Gupta, Jasper C.H.

Identifying Useful Learnwares for Heterogeneous Label Spaces	The learnware paradigm aims to build a learnware market containing numerous learnwares, each of which is a well-performing machine learning model with a corresponding specification to describe its functionality so that future users can identify useful models for reuse according to their own requirements. With the learnware paradigm, model developers can spontaneously submit models to the market without leaking data privacy, and users can leverage models in the market to accomplish different machine learning tasks without having to build models from scratch. Recent studies have attempted to realize the model specification through Reduced Kernel Mean Embedding (RKME). In this paper, we make an attempt to improve the effectiveness of RKME specification for heterogeneous label spaces, where the learnware market does not contain a model that has the same label space as the user's task, by considering a class-specific model specification explicitly, along with a class-wise learnware identification method. Both theoretical and empirical analyses show that our proposal can quickly and accurately find useful learnwares that satisfy users' requirements. Moreover, we find that for a specific task, reusing a small model identified via the specification performs better than directly reusing a pre-trained generic big model.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/guo23l	Lan-Zhe Guo, Zhi Zhou, Yu-Feng Li, Zhi-Hua Zhou
Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects: Mutual Information Bounds and Learning Algorithms	Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) from observational studies is rising in importance due to the widespread accumulation of data in many fields. Due to the selection bias behind the inaccessibility of counterfactual data, the problem differs fundamentally from supervised learning in a challenging way. However, existing works on modeling selection bias and corresponding algorithms do not naturally generalize to non-binary treatment spaces. To address this limitation, we propose to use mutual information to describe selection bias in estimating HTE and derive a novel error bound using the mutual information between the covariates and the treatments, which is the first error bound to cover general treatment schemes including multinoulli or continuous spaces. We then bring forth theoretically justified algorithms, the Mutual Information Treatment Network (MitNet), using adversarial optimization to reduce selection bias and obtain more accurate HTE estimations. Our algorithm reaches remarkable performance in both simulation study and empirical evaluation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/guo23k	Xingzhuo Guo, Yuchen Zhang, Jianmin Wang, Mingsheng Long
LongCoder: A Long-Range Pre-trained Language Model for Code Completion	In this paper, we introduce a new task for code completion that focuses on handling long code input and propose a sparse Transformer model, called LongCoder, to address this task. LongCoder employs a sliding window mechanism for self-attention and introduces two types of globally accessible tokens - bridge tokens and memory tokens - to improve performance and efficiency. Bridge tokens are inserted throughout the input sequence to aggregate local information and facilitate global interaction, while memory tokens are included to highlight important statements that may be invoked later and need to be memorized, such as package imports and definitions of classes, functions, or structures. We conduct experiments on a newly constructed dataset that contains longer code context and the publicly available CodeXGLUE benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that LongCoder achieves superior performance on code completion tasks compared to previous models while maintaining comparable efficiency in terms of computational resources during inference.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/guo23j	Daya Guo, Canwen Xu, Nan Duan, Jian Yin, Julian Mcauley
Graph Neural Networks with Learnable and Optimal Polynomial Bases	Polynomial filters, a kind of Graph Neural Networks, typically use a predetermined polynomial basis and learn the coefficients from the training data. It has been observed that the effectiveness of the model is highly dependent on the property of the polynomial basis. Consequently, two natural and fundamental questions arise: Can we learn a suitable polynomial basis from the training data? Can we determine the optimal polynomial basis for a given graph and node features? In this paper, we propose two spectral GNN models that provide positive answers to the questions posed above. First, inspired by Favard's Theorem, we propose the FavardGNN model, which learns a polynomial basis from the space of all possible orthonormal bases. Second, we examine the supposedly unsolvable definition of optimal polynomial basis from Wang et al. (2022) and propose a simple model, OptBasisGNN, which computes the optimal basis for a given graph structure and graph signal. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed models.

Hierarchical Grammar-Induced Geometry for Data-Efficient Molecular Property Prediction	The prediction of molecular properties is a crucial task in the field of material and drug discovery. The potential benefits of using deep learning techniques are reflected in the wealth of recent literature. Still, these techniques are faced with a common challenge in practice: Labeled data are limited by the cost of manual extraction from literature and laborious experimentation. In this work, we propose a data-efficient property predictor by utilizing a learnable hierarchical molecular grammar that can generate molecules from grammar production rules. Such a grammar induces an explicit geometry of the space of molecular graphs, which provides an informative prior on molecular structural similarity. The property prediction is performed using graph neural diffusion over the grammar-induced geometry. On both small and large datasets, our evaluation shows that this approach outperforms a wide spectrum of baselines, including supervised and pre-trained graph neural networks. We include a detailed ablation study and further analysis of our solution, showing its effectiveness in cases with extremely limited data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/guo23h	Minghao Guo, Veronika Thost, Samuel W Song, Adithya Balachandran, Payel Das, Jie Chen, Wojciech Matusik
FedBR: Improving Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Data via Local Learning Bias Reduction	Federated Learning (FL) is a way for machines to learn from data that is kept locally, in order to protect the privacy of clients. This is typically done using local SGD, which helps to improve communication efficiency. However, such a scheme is currently constrained by slow and unstable convergence due to the variety of data on different clients' devices. In this work, we identify three under-explored phenomena of biased local learning that may explain these challenges caused by local updates in supervised FL. As a remedy, we propose FedBR, a novel unified algorithm that reduces the local learning bias on features and classifiers to tackle these challenges. FedBR has two components. The first component helps to reduce bias in local classifiers by balancing the output of the models. The second component helps to learn local features that are similar to global features, but different from those learned from other data sources. We conducted several experiments to test FedBR and found that it consistently outperforms other SOTA FL methods. Both of its components also individually show performance gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/lins-lab/fedbr.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/guo23g	Yongxin Guo, Xiaoying Tang, Tao Lin
Linkless Link Prediction via Relational Distillation	Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown exceptional performance in the task of link prediction. Despite their effectiveness, the high latency brought by non-trivial neighborhood data dependency limits GNNs in practical deployments. Conversely, the known efficient MLPs are much less effective than GNNs due to the lack of relational knowledge. In this work, to combine the advantages of GNNs and MLPs, we start with exploring direct knowledge distillation (KD) methods for link prediction, i.e., predicted logit-based matching and node representation-based matching. Upon observing direct KD analogs do not perform well for link prediction, we propose a relational KD framework, Linkless Link Prediction (LLP), to distill knowledge for link prediction with MLPs. Unlike simple KD methods that match independent link logits or node representations, LLP distills relational knowledge that is centered around each (anchor) node to the student MLP. Specifically, we propose rank-based matching and distribution-based matching strategies that complement each other. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP boosts the link prediction performance of MLPs with significant margins and even outperforms the teacher GNNs on 7 out of 8 benchmarks. LLP also achieves a 70.68x speedup in link prediction inference compared to GNNs on the large-scale OGB dataset.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/guo23f	Zhichun Guo, William Shiao, Shichang Zhang, Yozen Liu, Nitesh V Chawla, Neil Shah, Tong Zhao
Analyzing Privacy Leakage in Machine Learning via Multiple Hypothesis Testing: A Lesson From Fano	Differential privacy (DP) is by far the most widely accepted framework for mitigating privacy risks in machine learning. However, exactly how small the privacy parameter $\epsilon$ needs to be to protect against certain privacy risks in practice is still not well-understood. In this work, we study data reconstruction attacks for discrete data and analyze it under the framework of multiple hypothesis testing. For a learning algorithm satisfying $(\alpha, \epsilon)$-Renyi DP, we utilize different variants of the celebrated Fano's inequality to upper bound the attack advantage of a data reconstruction adversary. Our bound can be numerically computed to relate the parameter $\epsilon$ to the desired level of privacy protection in practice, and complements the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of DP against data reconstruction attacks even at relatively large values of $\epsilon$.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/guo23e	Chuan Guo, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Maziar Sanjabi

FeDXL: Provable Federated Learning for Deep X-Risk Optimization	In this paper, we tackle a novel federated learning (FL) problem for optimizing a family of X-risks, to which no existing FL algorithms are applicable. In particular, the objective has the form of $\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{z}\sim \mathcal{S}_1} f(\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{z}'\sim\mathcal{S}_2} \ell(\mathbf{w}; \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{z}'))$, where two sets of data $\mathcal S_1, \mathcal S_2$ are distributed over multiple machines, $\ell(\cdot; \cdot,\cdot)$ is a pairwise loss that only depends on the prediction outputs of the input data pairs $(\mathbf{z}, \mathbf{z}')$. This problem has important applications in machine learning, e.g., AUROC maximization with a pairwise loss, and partial AUROC maximization with a compositional loss. The challenges for designing an FL algorithm for X-risks lie in the non-decomposability of the objective over multiple machines and the interdependency between different machines. To this end, we propose an active-passive decomposition framework that decouples the gradient's components with two types, namely active parts and passive parts, where the active parts depend on local data that are computed with the local model and the passive parts depend on other machines that are communicated/computed based on historical models and samples. Under this framework, we design two FL algorithms (FeDXL) for handling linear and nonlinear $f$, respectively, based on federated averaging and merging and develop a novel theoretical analysis to combat the latency of the passive parts and the interdependency between the local model parameters and the involved data for computing local gradient estimators. We establish both iteration and communication complexities and show that using the historical samples and models for computing the passive parts do not degrade the complexities. We conduct empirical studies of FeDXL for deep AUROC and partial AUROC maximization, and demonstrate their performance compared with several baselines.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/guo23c	Zhishuai Guo, Rong Jin, Jiebo Luo, Tianbao Yang
Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Federated Learning via Implicit Invariant Relationships	Out-of-distribution generalization is challenging for non-participating clients of federated learning under distribution shifts. A proven strategy is to explore those invariant relationships between input and target variables, working equally well for non-participating clients. However, learning invariant relationships is often in an explicit manner from data, representation, and distribution, which violates the federated principles of privacy-preserving and limited communication. In this paper, we propose FedIIR, which implicitly learns invariant relationships from parameter for out-of-distribution generalization, adhering to the above principles. Specifically, we utilize the prediction disagreement to quantify invariant relationships and implicitly reduce it through inter-client gradient alignment. Theoretically, we demonstrate the range of non-participating clients to which FedIIR is expected to generalize and present the convergence results for FedIIR in the massively distributed with limited communication. Extensive experiments show that FedIIR significantly outperforms relevant baselines in terms of out-of-distribution generalization of federated learning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/guo23b	Yaming Guo, Kai Guo, Xiaofeng Cao, Tieru Wu, Yi Chang
Privacy-Aware Compression for Federated Learning Through Numerical Mechanism Design	In private federated learning (FL), a server aggregates differentially private updates from a large number of clients in order to train a machine learning model. The main challenge in this setting is balancing privacy with both classification accuracy of the learnt model as well as the number of bits communicated between the clients and server. Prior work has achieved a good trade-off by designing a privacy-aware compression mechanism, called the minimum variance unbiased (MVU) mechanism, that numerically solves an optimization problem to determine the parameters of the mechanism. This paper builds upon it by introducing a new interpolation procedure in the numerical design process that allows for a far more efficient privacy analysis. The result is the new Interpolated MVU mechanism that is more scalable, has a better privacy-utility trade-off, and provides SOTA results on communication-efficient private FL on a variety of datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/guo23a	Chuan Guo, Kamalika Chaudhuri, Pierre Stock, Michael Rabbat
Conformalization of Sparse Generalized Linear Models	Given a sequence of observable variables $\{(x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)\}$, the conformal prediction method estimates a confidence set for $y_{n+1}$ given $x_{n+1}$ that is valid for any finite sample size by merely assuming that the joint distribution of the data is permutation invariant. Although attractive, computing such a set is computationally infeasible in most regression problems. Indeed, in these cases, the unknown variable $y_{n+1}$ can take an infinite number of possible candidate values, and generating conformal sets requires retraining a predictive model for each candidate. In this paper, we focus on a sparse linear model with only a subset of variables for prediction and use numerical continuation techniques to approximate the solution path efficiently. The critical property we exploit is that the set of selected variables is invariant under a small perturbation of the input data. Therefore, it is sufficient to enumerate and refit the model only at the change points of the set of active features and smoothly interpolate the rest of the solution via a Predictor-Corrector mechanism. We show how our path-following algorithm accurately approximates conformal prediction sets and illustrate its performance using synthetic and real data examples.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/guha23b	Etash Kumar Guha, Eugene Ndiaye, Xiaoming Huo
On Excess Mass Behavior in Gaussian Mixture Models with Orlicz-Wasserstein Distances	Dirichlet Process mixture models (DPMM) in combination with Gaussian kernels have been an important modeling tool for numerous data domains arising from biological, physical, and social sciences. However, this versatility in applications does not extend to strong theoretical guarantees for the underlying parameter estimates, for which only a logarithmic rate is achieved. In this work, we (re)introduce and investigate a metric, named Orlicz-Wasserstein distance, in the study of the Bayesian contraction behavior for the parameters. We show that despite the overall slow convergence guarantees for all the parameters, posterior contraction for parameters happens at almost polynomial rates in outlier regions of the parameter space. Our theoretical results provide new insight in understanding the convergence behavior of parameters arising from various settings of hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric models. In addition, we provide an algorithm to compute the metric by leveraging Sinkhorn divergences and validate our findings through a simulation study.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/guha23a	Aritra Guha, Nhat Ho, Xuanlong Nguyen
DecompDiff: Diffusion Models with Decomposed Priors for Structure-Based Drug Design	Designing 3D ligands within a target binding site is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Existing structured-based drug design methods treat all ligand atoms equally, which ignores different roles of atoms in the ligand for drug design and can be less efficient for exploring the large drug-like molecule space. In this paper, inspired by the convention in pharmaceutical practice, we decompose the ligand molecule into two parts, namely arms and scaffold, and propose a new diffusion model, DecompDiff, with decomposed priors over arms and scaffold. In order to facilitate the decomposed generation and improve the properties of the generated molecules, we incorporate both bond diffusion in the model and additional validity guidance in the sampling phase. Extensive experiments on CrossDocked2020 show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-affinity molecules while maintaining proper molecular properties and conformational stability, with up to $-8.39$ Avg.

NerfDiff: Single-image View Synthesis with NeRF-guided Distillation from 3D-aware Diffusion	Novel view synthesis from a single image requires inferring occluded regions of objects and scenes whilst simultaneously maintaining semantic and physical consistency with the input. Existing approaches condition neural radiance fields (NeRF) on local image features, projecting points to the input image plane, and aggregating 2D features to perform volume rendering. However, under severe occlusion, this projection fails to resolve uncertainty, resulting in blurry renderings that lack details. In this work, we propose NerfDiff, which addresses this issue by distilling the knowledge of a 3D-aware conditional diffusion model (CDM) into NeRF through synthesizing and refining a set of virtual views at test-time. We further propose a novel NeRF-guided distillation algorithm that simultaneously generates 3D consistent virtual views from the CDM samples, and finetunes the NeRF based on the improved virtual views. Our approach significantly outperforms existing NeRF-based and geometry-free approaches on challenging datasets including ShapeNet, ABO, and Clevr3D.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gu23a	Jiatao Gu, Alex Trevithick, Kai-En Lin, Joshua M.

EF21-P and Friends: Improved Theoretical Communication Complexity for Distributed Optimization with Bidirectional Compression	In this work we focus our attention on distributed optimization problems in the context where the communication time between the server and the workers is non-negligible. We obtain novel methods supporting bidirectional compression (both from the server to the workers and vice versa) that enjoy new state-of-the-art theoretical communication complexity for convex and nonconvex problems. Our bounds are the first that manage to decouple the variance/error coming from the workers-to-server and server-to-workers compression, transforming a multiplicative dependence to an additive one. Moreover, in the convex regime, we obtain the first bounds that match the theoretical communication complexity of gradient descent. Even in this convex regime, our algorithms work with biased gradient estimators, which is non-standard and requires new proof techniques that may be of independent interest. Finally, our theoretical results are corroborated through suitable experiments.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gruntkowska23a	Kaja Gruntkowska, Alexander Tyurin, Peter Richtárik
Hidden Symmetries of ReLU Networks	The parameter space for any fixed architecture of feedforward ReLU neural networks serves as a proxy during training for the associated class of functions - but how faithful is this representation? It is known that many different parameter settings $\theta$ can determine the same function $f$. Moreover, the degree of this redundancy is inhomogeneous: for some networks, the only symmetries are permutation of neurons in a layer and positive scaling of parameters at a neuron, while other networks admit additional hidden symmetries. In this work, we prove that, for any network architecture where no layer is narrower than the input, there exist parameter settings with no hidden symmetries. We also describe a number of mechanisms through which hidden symmetries can arise, and empirically approximate the functional dimension of different network architectures at initialization. These experiments indicate that the probability that a network has no hidden symmetries decreases towards 0 as depth increases, while increasing towards 1 as width and input dimension increase.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/grigsby23a	Elisenda Grigsby, Kathryn Lindsey, David Rolnick
On Sampling with Approximate Transport Maps	Transport maps can ease the sampling of distributions with non-trivial geometries by transforming them into distributions that are easier to handle. The potential of this approach has risen with the development of Normalizing Flows (NF) which are maps parameterized with deep neural networks trained to push a reference distribution towards a target. NF-enhanced samplers recently proposed blend (Markov chain) Monte Carlo methods with either (i) proposal draws from the flow or (ii) a flow-based reparametrization. In both cases, the quality of the learned transport conditions performance. The present work clarifies for the first time the relative strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches. Our study concludes that multimodal targets can be reliably handled with flow-based proposals up to moderately high dimensions. In contrast, methods relying on reparametrization struggle with multimodality but are more robust otherwise in high-dimensional settings and under poor training. To further illustrate the influence of target-proposal adequacy, we also derive a new quantitative bound for the mixing time of the Independent Metropolis-Hastings sampler.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/grenioux23a	Louis Grenioux, Alain Oliviero Durmus, Eric Moulines, Marylou Gabrié
Topological Point Cloud Clustering	We present Topological Point Cloud Clustering (TPCC), a new method to cluster points in an arbitrary point cloud based on their contribution to global topological features. TPCC synthesizes desirable features from spectral clustering and topological data analysis and is based on considering the spectral properties of a simplicial complex associated to the considered point cloud. As it is based on considering sparse eigenvector computations, TPCC is similarly easy to interpret and implement as spectral clustering. However, by focusing not just on a single matrix associated to a graph created from the point cloud data, but on a whole set of Hodge-Laplacians associated to an appropriately constructed simplicial complex, we can leverage a far richer set of topological features to characterize the data points within the point cloud and benefit from the relative robustness of topological techniques against noise. We test the performance of TPCC on both synthetic and real-world data and compare it with classical spectral clustering.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/grande23a	Vincent Peter Grande, Michael T Schaub
Formalizing Preferences Over Runtime Distributions	When trying to solve a computational problem, we are often faced with a choice between algorithms that are guaranteed to return the right answer but differ in their runtime distributions (e.g., SAT solvers, sorting algorithms). This paper aims to lay theoretical foundations for such choices by formalizing preferences over runtime distributions. It might seem that we should simply prefer the algorithm that minimizes expected runtime. However, such preferences would be driven by exactly how slow our algorithm is on bad inputs, whereas in practice we are typically willing to cut off occasional, sufficiently long runs before they finish. We propose a principled alternative, taking a utility-theoretic approach to characterize the scoring functions that describe preferences over algorithms. These functions depend on the way our value for solving our problem decreases with time and on the distribution from which captimes are drawn. We describe examples of realistic utility functions and show how to leverage a maximum-entropy approach for modeling underspecified captime distributions. Finally, we show how to efficiently estimate an algorithm's expected utility from runtime samples.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/graham23a	Devon R. Graham, Kevin Leyton-Brown, Tim Roughgarden
Adaptive Annealed Importance Sampling with Constant Rate Progress	Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) synthesizes weighted samples from an intractable distribution given its unnormalized density function. This algorithm relies on a sequence of interpolating distributions bridging the target to an initial tractable distribution such as the well-known geometric mean path of unnormalized distributions which is assumed to be suboptimal in general. In this paper, we prove that the geometric annealing corresponds to the distribution path that minimizes the KL divergence between the current particle distribution and the desired target when the feasible change in the particle distribution is constrained. Following this observation, we derive the constant rate discretization schedule for this annealing sequence, which adjusts the schedule to the difficulty of moving samples between the initial and the target distributions. We further extend our results to $f$-divergences and present the respective dynamics of annealing sequences based on which we propose the Constant Rate AIS (CR-AIS) algorithm and its efficient implementation for $\alpha$-divergences. We empirically show that CR-AIS performs well on multiple benchmark distributions while avoiding the computationally expensive tuning loop in existing Adaptive AIS.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/goshtasbpour23a	Shirin Goshtasbpour, Victor Cohen, Fernando Perez-Cruz
Convergence of Proximal Point and Extragradient-Based Methods Beyond Monotonicity: the Case of Negative Comonotonicity	Algorithms for min-max optimization and variational inequalities are often studied under monotonicity assumptions. Motivated by non-monotone machine learning applications, we follow the line of works (Diakonikolas et al., 2021; Lee & Kim, 2021; Pethick et al., 2022; Bohm,2022) aiming at going beyond monotonicity by considering the weaker	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gorbunov23a	Eduard Gorbunov, Adrien Taylor, Samuel Horváth, Gauthier Gidel
Learning Distributions over Quantum Measurement Outcomes	Shadow tomography for quantum states provides a sample efficient approach for predicting the measurement outcomes of quantum systems. However, these shadow tomography procedures yield poor bounds if there are more than two outcomes per measurement. In this paper, we consider a general problem of learning properties from quantum states: given an unknown $d$-dimensional quantum state $\rho$ and $M$ unknown quantum measurements $\mathcal{M}_1,...,\mathcal{M}_M$ with $K\geq 2$ outcomes, estimating the probability distribution for applying $\mathcal{M}_i$ on $\rho$ to within total variation distance $\epsilon$. Compared to the special case when $K=2$, we have to learn unknown distributions instead of values. Here, we propose an online shadow tomography procedure that solves this problem with high success probability requiring $\tilde{O}(K\log^2M\log d/\epsilon^4)$ copies of $\rho$. We further prove an information-theoretic lower bound showing that at least $\Omega(\min\{d^2,K+\log M\}/\epsilon^2)$ copies of $\rho$ are required to solve this problem with high success probability. Our shadow tomography procedure requires sample complexity with only logarithmic dependence on $M$ and $d$ and is sample-optimal concerning the dependence on $K$.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gong23a	Weiyuan Gong, Scott Aaronson
Robust Consensus in Ranking Data Analysis: Definitions, Properties and Computational Issues	As the issue of robustness in AI systems becomes vital, statistical learning techniques that are reliable even in presence of partly contaminated data have to be developed. Preference data, in the form of (complete) rankings in the simplest situations, are no exception and the demand for appropriate concepts and tools is all the more pressing given that technologies fed by or producing this type of data ($\textit{e.g.}$ search engines, recommending systems) are now massively deployed. However, the lack of vector space structure for the set of rankings ($\textit{i.e.}$ the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$) and the complex nature of statistics considered in ranking data analysis make the formulation of robustness objectives in this domain challenging. In this paper, we introduce notions of robustness, together with dedicated statistical methods, for $\textit{Consensus Ranking}$ the flagship problem in ranking data analysis, aiming at summarizing a probability distribution on $\mathfrak{S}_n$ by a $\textit{median}$ ranking. Precisely, we propose specific extensions of the popular concept of	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/goibert23a	Morgane Goibert, Clément Calauzènes, Ekhine Irurozki, Stephan Clémençon
Aligning Language Models with Preferences through $f$-divergence Minimization	Aligning language models with preferences can be posed as approximating a target distribution representing some desired behavior. Existing approaches differ both in the functional form of the target distribution and the algorithm used to approximate it. For instance, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) corresponds to minimizing a reverse KL from an implicit target distribution arising from a KL penalty in the objective. On the other hand, Generative Distributional Control (GDC) has an explicit target distribution and minimizes a forward KL from it using the Distributional Policy Gradient (DPG) algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new approach, $f$-DPG, which allows the use of any $f$-divergence to approximate any target distribution that can be evaluated. $f$-DPG unifies both frameworks (RLHF, GDC) and the approximation methods (DPG, RL with KL penalties). We show the practical benefits of various choices of divergence objectives and demonstrate that there is no universally optimal objective but that different divergences present different alignment and diversity trade-offs. We show that Jensen-Shannon divergence strikes a good balance between these objectives, and frequently outperforms forward KL divergence by a wide margin, leading to significant improvements over prior work. These distinguishing characteristics between divergences persist as the model size increases, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate divergence objectives.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/go23a	Dongyoung Go, Tomasz Korbak, Germàn Kruszewski, Jos Rozen, Nahyeon Ryu, Marc Dymetman
Efficient RL via Disentangled Environment and Agent Representations	Agents that are aware of the separation between the environments and themselves can leverage this understanding to form effective representations of visual input. We propose an approach for learning such structured representations for RL algorithms, using visual knowledge of the agent, which is often inexpensive to obtain, such as its shape or mask. This is incorporated into the RL objective using a simple auxiliary loss. We show that our method, SEAR (Structured Environment-Agent Representations), outperforms state-of-the-art model-free approaches over 18 different challenging visual simulation environments spanning 5 different robots.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gmelin23a	Kevin Gmelin, Shikhar Bahl, Russell Mendonca, Deepak Pathak
Adversarial robustness of amortized Bayesian inference	Bayesian inference usually requires running potentially costly inference procedures separately for every new observation. In contrast, the idea of amortized Bayesian inference is to initially invest computational cost in training an inference network on simulated data, which can subsequently be used to rapidly perform inference (i.e., to return estimates of posterior distributions) for new observations. This approach has been applied to many real-world models in the sciences and engineering, but it is unclear how robust the approach is to adversarial perturbations in the observed data. Here, we study the adversarial robustness of amortized Bayesian inference, focusing on simulation-based estimation of multi-dimensional posterior distributions. We show that almost unrecognizable, targeted perturbations of the observations can lead to drastic changes in the predicted posterior and highly unrealistic posterior predictive samples, across several benchmark tasks and a real-world example from neuroscience. We propose a computationally efficient regularization scheme based on penalizing the Fisher information of the conditional density estimator, and show how it improves the adversarial robustness of amortized Bayesian inference.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gloeckler23a	Manuel Gloeckler, Michael Deistler, Jakob H.

Multicalibration as Boosting for Regression	"We study the connection between multicalibration and boosting for squared error regression. First we prove a useful characterization of multicalibration in terms of a ""swap regret"" like condition on squared error. Using this characterization, we give an exceedingly simple algorithm that can be analyzed both as a boosting algorithm for regression and as a multicalibration algorithm for a class $\mathcal{H}$ that makes use only of a standard squared error regression oracle for $\mathcal{H}$. We give a weak learning assumption on $\mathcal{H}$ that ensures convergence to Bayes optimality without the need to make any realizability assumptions — giving us an agnostic boosting algorithm for regression. We then show that our weak learning assumption on $\mathcal{H}$ is both necessary and sufficient for multicalibration with respect to $\mathcal{H}$ to imply Bayes optimality, answering an open question. We also show that if $\mathcal{H}$ satisfies our weak learning condition relative to another class $\mathcal{C}$ then multicalibration with respect to $\mathcal{H}$ implies multicalibration with respect to $\mathcal{C}$. Finally we investigate the empirical performance of our algorithm experimentally."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/globus-harris23a	Ira Globus-Harris, Declan Harrison, Michael Kearns, Aaron Roth, Jessica Sorrell
Generalized Disparate Impact for Configurable Fairness Solutions in ML	We make two contributions in the field of AI fairness over continuous protected attributes. First, we show that the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Renyi (HGR) indicator (the only one currently available for such a case) is valuable but subject to a few crucial limitations regarding semantics, interpretability, and robustness. Second, we introduce a family of indicators that are: 1) complementary to HGR in terms of semantics; 2) fully interpretable and transparent; 3) robust over finite samples; 4) configurable to suit specific applications. Our approach also allows us to define fine-grained constraints to permit certain types of dependence and forbid others selectively. By expanding the available options for continuous protected attributes, our approach represents a significant contribution to the area of fair artificial intelligence.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/giuliani23a	Luca Giuliani, Eleonora Misino, Michele Lombardi
Looped Transformers as Programmable Computers	We present a framework for using transformer networks as universal computers by programming them with specific weights and placing them in a loop. Our input sequence acts as a punchcard, consisting of instructions and memory for data read/writes. We demonstrate that a constant number of encoder layers can emulate basic computing blocks, including lexicographic operations, non-linear functions, function calls, program counters, and conditional branches. Using this framework, we emulate a computer using a simple instruction-set architecture, which allows us to map iterative algorithms to programs that can be executed by a constant depth looped transformer network. We show how a single frozen transformer, instructed by its input, can emulate a basic calculator, a basic linear algebra library, and even a full backpropagation, in-context learning algorithm. Our findings reveal the potential of transformer networks as programmable compute units and offer insight into the mechanics of attention.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/giannou23a	Angeliki Giannou, Shashank Rajput, Jy-Yong Sohn, Kangwook Lee, Jason D.

Dividing and Conquering a BlackBox to a Mixture of Interpretable Models: Route, Interpret, Repeat	ML model design either starts with an interpretable model or a Blackbox and explains it post hoc. Blackbox models are flexible but difficult to explain, while interpretable models are inherently explainable. Yet, interpretable models require extensive ML knowledge and tend to be less flexible, potentially underperforming than their Blackbox equivalents. This paper aims to blur the distinction between a post hoc explanation of a Blackbox and constructing interpretable models.

Harmonic Neural Networks	Harmonic functions are abundant in nature, appearing in limiting cases of Maxwell's, Navier-Stokes equations, the heat and the wave equation. Consequently, there are many applications of harmonic functions from industrial process optimisation to robotic path planning and the calculation of first exit times of random walks. Despite their ubiquity and relevance, there have been few attempts to incorporate inductive biases towards harmonic functions in machine learning contexts. In this work, we demonstrate effective means of representing harmonic functions in neural networks and extend such results also to quantum neural networks to demonstrate the generality of our approach. We benchmark our approaches against (quantum) physics-informed neural networks, where we show favourable performance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ghosh23b	Atiyo Ghosh, Antonio Andrea Gentile, Mario Dagrada, Chul Lee, Seong-Hyok Sean Kim, Hyukgeun Cha, Yunjun Choi, Dongho Kim, Jeong-Il Kye, Vincent Emanuel Elfving
Reinforcement Learning from Passive Data via Latent Intentions	Passive observational data, such as human videos, is abundant and rich in information, yet remains largely untapped by current RL methods. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that passive data, despite not having reward or action labels, can still be used to learn features that accelerate downstream RL. Our approach learns from passive data by modeling intentions: measuring how the likelihood of future outcomes change when the agent acts to achieve a particular task. We propose a temporal difference learning objective to learn about intentions, resulting in an algorithm similar to conventional RL, but which learns entirely from passive data. When optimizing this objective, our agent simultaneously learns representations of states, of policies, and of possible outcomes in an environment, all from raw observational data. Both theoretically and empirically, this scheme learns features amenable for value prediction for downstream tasks, and our experiments demonstrate the ability to learn from many forms of passive data, including cross-embodiment video data and YouTube videos.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ghosh23a	Dibya Ghosh, Chethan Anand Bhateja, Sergey Levine
Contextual Reliability: When Different Features Matter in Different Contexts	"Deep neural networks often fail catastrophically by relying on spurious correlations. Most prior work assumes a clear dichotomy into spurious and reliable features; however, this is often unrealistic. For example, most of the time we do not want an autonomous car to simply copy the speed of surrounding cars—we don't want our car to run a red light if a neighboring car does so. However, we cannot simply enforce invariance to next-lane speed, since it could provide valuable information about an unobservable pedestrian at a crosswalk. Thus, universally ignoring features that are sometimes (but not always) reliable can lead to non-robust performance. We formalize a new setting called contextual reliability which accounts for the fact that the ""right"" features to use may vary depending on the context. We propose and analyze a two-stage framework called Explicit Non-spurious feature Prediction (ENP) which first identifies the relevant features to use for a given context, then trains a model to rely exclusively on these features. Our work theoretically and empirically demonstrates the advantages of ENP over existing methods and provides new benchmarks for contextual reliability."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ghosal23a	Gaurav Rohit Ghosal, Amrith Setlur, Daniel S.

On User-Level Private Convex Optimization	We introduce a new mechanism for stochastic convex optimization (SCO) with user-level differential privacy guarantees. The convergence rates of this mechanism are similar to those in the prior work of Levy et al. 2021 and Narayanan et al. 2022, but with two important improvements. Our mechanism does not require any smoothness assumptions on the loss. Furthermore, our bounds are also the first where the minimum number of users needed for user-level privacy has no dependence on the dimension and only a logarithmic dependence on the desired excess error. The main idea underlying the new mechanism is to show that the optimizers of strongly convex losses have low local deletion sensitivity, along with a new output perturbation method for functions with low local deletion sensitivity, which could be of independent interest.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ghazi23a	Badih Ghazi, Pritish Kamath, Ravi Kumar, Pasin Manurangsi, Raghu Meka, Chiyuan Zhang
GAT: Guided Adversarial Training with Pareto-optimal Auxiliary Tasks	While leveraging additional training data is well established to improve adversarial robustness, it incurs the unavoidable cost of data collection and the heavy computation to train models. To mitigate the costs, we propose *Guided Adversarial Training * (GAT), a novel adversarial training technique that exploits auxiliary tasks under a limited set of training data. Our approach extends single-task models into multi-task models during the min-max optimization of adversarial training, and drives the loss optimization with a regularization of the gradient curvature across multiple tasks. GAT leverages two types of auxiliary tasks: self-supervised tasks, where the labels are generated automatically, and domain-knowledge tasks, where human experts provide additional labels. Experimentally, under limited data, GAT increases the robust accuracy on CIFAR-10 up to four times (from 11% to 42% robust accuracy) and the robust AUC of CheXpert medical imaging dataset from 50% to 83%. On the full CIFAR-10 dataset, GAT outperforms eight state-of-the-art adversarial training strategies. Our large study across five datasets and six tasks demonstrates that task augmentation is an efficient alternative to data augmentation, and can be key to achieving both clean and robust performances.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ghamizi23a	Salah Ghamizi, Jingfeng Zhang, Maxime Cordy, Mike Papadakis, Masashi Sugiyama, Yves Le Traon
Approximately Optimal Core Shapes for Tensor Decompositions	This work studies the combinatorial optimization problem of finding an optimal core tensor shape, also called multilinear rank, for a size-constrained Tucker decomposition. We give an algorithm with provable approximation guarantees for its reconstruction error via connections to higher-order singular values. Specifically, we introduce a novel Tucker packing problem, which we prove is NP-hard, and give a polynomial-time approximation scheme based on a reduction to the 2-dimensional knapsack problem with a matroid constraint. We also generalize our techniques to tree tensor network decompositions. We implement our algorithm using an integer programming solver, and show that its solution quality is competitive with (and sometimes better than) the greedy algorithm that uses the true Tucker decomposition loss at each step, while also running up to 1000x faster.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ghadiri23a	Mehrdad Ghadiri, Matthew Fahrbach, Gang Fu, Vahab Mirrokni
Oracles & Followers: Stackelberg Equilibria in Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning	Stackelberg equilibria arise naturally in a range of popular learning problems, such as in security games or indirect mechanism design, and have received increasing attention in the reinforcement learning literature. We present a general framework for implementing Stackelberg equilibria search as a multi-agent RL problem, allowing a wide range of algorithmic design choices. We discuss how previous approaches can be seen as specific instantiations of this framework. As a key insight, we note that the design space allows for approaches not previously seen in the literature, for instance by leveraging multitask and meta-RL techniques for follower convergence. We propose one such approach using contextual policies, and evaluate it experimentally on both standard and novel benchmark domains, showing greatly improved sample efficiency compared to previous approaches. Finally, we explore the effect of adopting algorithm designs outside the borders of our framework.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gerstgrasser23a	Matthias Gerstgrasser, David C. Parkes
Towards Reliable Neural Specifications	Having reliable specifications is an unavoidable challenge in achieving verifiable correctness, robustness, and interpretability of AI systems. Existing specifications for neural networks are in the paradigm of data as specification. That is, the local neighborhood centering around a reference input is considered to be correct (or robust). While existing specifications contribute to verifying adversarial robustness, a significant problem in many research domains, our empirical study shows that those verified regions are somewhat tight, and thus fail to allow verification of test set inputs, making them impractical for some real-world applications. To this end, we propose a new family of specifications called neural representation as specification. This form of specifications uses the intrinsic information of neural networks, specifically neural activation patterns (NAPs), rather than input data to specify the correctness and/or robustness of neural network predictions. We present a simple statistical approach to mining neural activation patterns. To show the effectiveness of discovered NAPs, we formally verify several important properties, such as various types of misclassifications will never happen for a given NAP, and there is no ambiguity between different NAPs. We show that by using NAP, we can verify a significant region of the input space, while still recalling 84% of the data on MNIST. Moreover, we can push the verifiable bound to 10 times larger on the CIFAR10 benchmark. Thus, we argue that NAPs can potentially be used as a more reliable and extensible specification for neural network verification.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/geng23a	Chuqin Geng, Nham Le, Xiaojie Xu, Zhaoyue Wang, Arie Gurfinkel, Xujie Si
Memory-Based Meta-Learning on Non-Stationary Distributions	Memory-based meta-learning is a technique for approximating Bayes-optimal predictors. Under fairly general conditions, minimizing sequential prediction error, measured by the log loss, leads to implicit meta-learning. The goal of this work is to investigate how far this interpretation can be realized by current sequence prediction models and training regimes. The focus is on piecewise stationary sources with unobserved switching-points, which arguably capture an important characteristic of natural language and action-observation sequences in partially observable environments. We show that various types of memory-based neural models, including Transformers, LSTMs, and RNNs can learn to accurately approximate known Bayes-optimal algorithms and behave as if performing Bayesian inference over the latent switching-points and the latent parameters governing the data distribution within each segment.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/genewein23a	Tim Genewein, Gregoire Deletang, Anian Ruoss, Li Kevin Wenliang, Elliot Catt, Vincent Dutordoir, Jordi Grau-Moya, Laurent Orseau, Marcus Hutter, Joel Veness
Transformers Meet Directed Graphs	Transformers were originally proposed as a sequence-to-sequence model for text but have become vital for a wide range of modalities, including images, audio, video, and undirected graphs. However, transformers for directed graphs are a surprisingly underexplored topic, despite their applicability to ubiquitous domains, including source code and logic circuits. In this work, we propose two direction- and structure-aware positional encodings for directed graphs: (1) the eigenvectors of the Magnetic Laplacian — a direction-aware generalization of the combinatorial Laplacian; (2) directional random walk encodings. Empirically, we show that the extra directionality information is useful in various downstream tasks, including correctness testing of sorting networks and source code understanding. Together with a data-flow-centric graph construction, our model outperforms the prior state of the art on the Open Graph Benchmark Code2 relatively by 14.7%.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/geisler23a	Simon Geisler, Yujia Li, Daniel J Mankowitz, Ali Taylan Cemgil, Stephan Günnemann, Cosmin Paduraru
Cramming: Training a Language Model on a single GPU in one day.	Recent trends in language modeling have focused on increasing performance through scaling, and have resulted in an environment where training language models is out of reach for most researchers and practitioners. While most in the community are asking how to push the limits of extreme computation, we ask the opposite question: How far can we get with a single GPU in just one day? We investigate the downstream performance achievable with a transformer-based language model trained completely from scratch with masked language modeling for a single day on a single consumer GPU. Aside from re-analyzing nearly all components of the pretraining pipeline for this scenario and providing a modified pipeline with performance close to BERT, we investigate why scaling down is hard, and which modifications actually improve performance in this scenario. We provide evidence that even in this constrained setting, performance closely follows scaling laws observed in large-compute settings. Through the lens of scaling laws, we categorize a range of recent improvements to training and architecture and discuss their merit and practical applicability (or lack thereof) for the limited compute setting. We provide code to reproduce all experiments at github.com/JonasGeiping/cramming .	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/geiping23a	Jonas Geiping, Tom Goldstein
Compositional Score Modeling for Simulation-Based Inference	Neural Posterior Estimation methods for simulation-based inference can be ill-suited for dealing with posterior distributions obtained by conditioning on multiple observations, as they tend to require a large number of simulator calls to learn accurate approximations. In contrast, Neural Likelihood Estimation methods can handle multiple observations at inference time after learning from individual observations, but they rely on standard inference methods, such as MCMC or variational inference, which come with certain performance drawbacks. We introduce a new method based on conditional score modeling that enjoys the benefits of both approaches. We model the scores of the (diffused) posterior distributions induced by individual observations, and introduce a way of combining the learned scores to approximately sample from the target posterior distribution. Our approach is sample-efficient, can naturally aggregate multiple observations at inference time, and avoids the drawbacks of standard inference methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/geffner23a	Tomas Geffner, George Papamakarios, Andriy Mnih
A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Dynamic Mediation Analysis	Mediation analysis learns the causal effect transmitted via mediator variables between treatments and outcomes, and receives increasing attention in various scientific domains to elucidate causal relations. Most existing works focus on point-exposure studies where each subject only receives one treatment at a single time point. However, there are a number of applications (e.g., mobile health) where the treatments are sequentially assigned over time and the dynamic mediation effects are of primary interest. Proposing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework, we are the first to evaluate dynamic mediation effects in settings with infinite horizons. We decompose the average treatment effect into an immediate direct effect, an immediate mediation effect, a delayed direct effect, and a delayed mediation effect. Upon the identification of each effect component, we further develop robust and semi-parametrically efficient estimators under the RL framework to infer these causal effects. The superior performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through extensive numerical studies, theoretical results, and an analysis of a mobile health dataset. A Python implementation of the proposed procedure is available at https://github.com/linlinlin97/MediationRL.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ge23a	Lin Ge, Jitao Wang, Chengchun Shi, Zhenke Wu, Rui Song
On the Global Convergence of Fitted Q-Iteration with Two-layer Neural Network Parametrization	Deep Q-learning based algorithms have been applied successfully in many decision making problems, while their theoretical foundations are not as well understood. In this paper, we study a Fitted Q-Iteration with two-layer ReLU neural network parameterization, and find the sample complexity guarantees for the algorithm. Our approach estimates the Q-function in each iteration using a convex optimization problem. We show that this approach achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon^{2})$, which is order-optimal. This result holds for a countable state-spaces and does not require any assumptions such as a linear or low rank structure on the MDP.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gaur23a	Mudit Gaur, Vaneet Aggarwal, Mridul Agarwal
Federated Heavy Hitter Recovery under Linear Sketching	Motivated by real-life deployments of multi-round federated analytics with secure aggregation, we investigate the fundamental communication-accuracy tradeoffs of the heavy hitter discovery and approximate (open-domain) histogram problems under a linear sketching constraint. We propose efficient algorithms based on local subsampling and invertible bloom look-up tables (IBLTs). We also show that our algorithms are information-theoretically optimal for a broad class of interactive schemes. The results show that the linear sketching constraint does increase the communication cost for both tasks by introducing an extra linear dependence on the number of users in a round. Moreover, our results also establish a separation between the communication cost for heavy hitter discovery and approximate histogram in the multi-round setting. The dependence on the number of rounds $R$ is at most logarithmic for heavy hitter discovery whereas that of approximate histogram is $\Theta(\sqrt{R})$. We also empirically demonstrate our findings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gascon23a	Adria Gascon, Peter Kairouz, Ziteng Sun, Ananda Theertha Suresh
Self-supervised learning of Split Invariant Equivariant representations	Recent progress has been made towards learning invariant or equivariant representations with self-supervised learning. While invariant methods are evaluated on large scale datasets, equivariant ones are evaluated in smaller, more controlled, settings. We aim at bridging the gap between the two in order to learn more diverse representations that are suitable for a wide range of tasks. We start by introducing a dataset called 3DIEBench, consisting of renderings from 3D models over 55 classes and more than 2.5 million images where we have full control on the transformations applied to the objects. We further introduce a predictor architecture based on hypernetworks to learn equivariant representations with no possible collapse to invariance. We introduce SIE (Split Invariant-Equivariant) which combines the hypernetwork-based predictor with representations split in two parts, one invariant, the other equivariant, to learn richer representations. We demonstrate significant performance gains over existing methods on equivariance related tasks from both a qualitative and quantitative point of view. We further analyze our introduced predictor and show how it steers the learned latent space. We hope that both our introduced dataset and approach will enable learning richer representations without supervision in more complex scenarios. Code and data are available at https://github.com/garridoq/SIE.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/garrido23b	Quentin Garrido, Laurent Najman, Yann Lecun
RankMe: Assessing the Downstream Performance of Pretrained Self-Supervised Representations by Their Rank	Joint-Embedding Self Supervised Learning (JE-SSL) has seen a rapid development, with the emergence of many method variations but only few principled guidelines that would help practitioners to successfully deploy them. The main reason for that pitfall comes from JE-SSL's core principle of not employing any input reconstruction therefore lacking visual cues of unsuccessful training. Adding non informative loss values to that, it becomes difficult to deploy SSL on a new dataset for which no labels can help to judge the quality of the learned representation. In this study, we develop a simple unsupervised criterion that is indicative of the quality of the learned JE-SSL representations: their effective rank. Albeit simple and computationally friendly, this method —coined RankMe— allows one to assess the performance of JE-SSL representations, even on different downstream datasets, without requiring any labels. A further benefit of RankMe is that it does not have any training or hyper-parameters to tune. Through thorough empirical experiments involving hundreds of training episodes, we demonstrate how RankMe can be used for hyperparameter selection with nearly no reduction in final performance compared to the current selection method that involve a dataset's labels. We hope that RankMe will facilitate the deployment of JE-SSL towards domains that do not have the opportunity to rely on labels for representations' quality assessment.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/garrido23a	Quentin Garrido, Randall Balestriero, Laurent Najman, Yann Lecun

Meanwhile, popular deep domain adaptation heuristics tend to falter when faced with label proportions shifts.

The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Few-shot Learning for Machine Translation	We demonstrate the potential of few-shot translation systems, trained with unpaired language data, for both high and low-resource language pairs. We show that with only 5 examples of high-quality translation data shown at inference, a transformer decoder-only model trained solely with self-supervised learning, is able to match specialized supervised state-of-the-art models as well as more general commercial translation systems. In particular, we outperform the best performing system on the WMT'21 English-Chinese news translation task by only using five examples of English-Chinese parallel data at inference. Furthermore, the resulting models are two orders of magnitude smaller than state-of-the-art language models. We then analyze the factors which impact the performance of few-shot translation systems, and highlight that the quality of the few-shot demonstrations heavily determines the quality of the translations generated by our models. Finally, we show that the few-shot paradigm also provides a way to control certain attributes of the translation — we show that we are able to control for regional varieties and formality using only a five examples at inference, paving the way towards controllable machine translation systems.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/garcia23a	Xavier Garcia, Yamini Bansal, Colin Cherry, George Foster, Maxim Krikun, Melvin Johnson, Orhan Firat
Scaling Laws for Reward Model Overoptimization	"In reinforcement learning from human feedback, it is common to optimize against a reward model trained to predict human preferences. Because the reward model is an imperfect proxy, optimizing its value too much can hinder ground truth performance, in accordance with Goodhart's law. This effect has been frequently observed, but not carefully measured due to the expense of collecting human preference data. In this work, we use a synthetic setup in which a fixed ""gold-standard"" reward model plays the role of humans, providing labels used to train a proxy reward model. We study how the gold reward model score changes as we optimize against the proxy reward model using either reinforcement learning or best-of-$n$ sampling. We find that this relationship follows a different functional form depending on the method of optimization, and that in both cases its coefficients scale smoothly with the number of reward model parameters. We also study the effect on this relationship of the size of the reward model dataset, the number of reward model and policy parameters, and the coefficient of the KL penalty added to the reward in the reinforcement learning setup. We explore the implications of these empirical results for theoretical considerations in AI alignment."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gao23h	Leo Gao, John Schulman, Jacob Hilton
Out-of-Domain Robustness via Targeted Augmentations	Models trained on one set of domains often suffer performance drops on unseen domains, e.g., when wildlife monitoring models are deployed in new camera locations. In this work, we study principles for designing data augmentations for out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. In particular, we focus on real-world scenarios in which some domain-dependent features are robust, i.e., some features that vary across domains are predictive OOD. For example, in the wildlife monitoring application above, image backgrounds vary across camera locations but indicate habitat type, which helps predict the species of photographed animals. Motivated by theoretical analysis on a linear setting, we propose targeted augmentations, which selectively randomize spurious domain-dependent features while preserving robust ones. We prove that targeted augmentations improve OOD performance, allowing models to generalize better with fewer domains. In contrast, existing approaches such as generic augmentations, which fail to randomize domain-dependent features, and domain-invariant augmentations, which randomize all domain-dependent features, both perform poorly OOD. In experiments on three real-world datasets, we show that targeted augmentations set new states-of-the-art for OOD performance by 3.2-15.2%.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gao23g	Irena Gao, Shiori Sagawa, Pang Wei Koh, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Percy Liang
PAL: Program-aided Language Models	"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive ability to perform arithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks, when provided with a few examples at test time (""few-shot prompting""). Much of this success can be attributed to prompting methods such as ""chain-of-thought"", which employ LLMs for both understanding the problem description by decomposing it into steps, as well as solving each step of the problem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this sort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often make logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solution part, even when the problem is decomposed correctly. In this paper, we present Program-Aided Language models (PAL): a novel approach that uses the LLM to read natural language problems and generate programs as the intermediate reasoning steps, but offloads the solution step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter. With PAL, decomposing the natural language problem into runnable steps remains the only learning task for the LLM, while solving is delegated to the interpreter. We demonstrate this synergy between a neural LLM and a symbolic interpreter across 13 mathematical, symbolic, and algorithmic reasoning tasks from BIG-Bench Hard and others. In all these natural language reasoning tasks, generating code using an LLM and reasoning using a Python interpreter leads to more accurate results than much larger models. For example, PAL using Codex achieves state-of-the-art few-shot accuracy on GSM8K, surpassing PaLM which uses chain-of-thought by absolute 15% top-1."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gao23f	Luyu Gao, Aman Madaan, Shuyan Zhou, Uri Alon, Pengfei Liu, Yiming Yang, Jamie Callan, Graham Neubig
DDGR: Continual Learning with Deep Diffusion-based Generative Replay	Popular deep-learning models in the field of image classification suffer from catastrophic forgetting—models will forget previously acquired skills when learning new ones. Generative replay (GR), which typically consists of a generator and a classifier, is an efficient way to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, conventional GR methods only focus on a single instruction relationship (generator-to-classifier), where the generator synthesizes samples for previous tasks to instruct the training of the classifier, while ignoring the ways in which the classifier can benefit the generator. In addition, most generative replay methods typically reuse the generated samples to update the generator, which causes the samples regenerated by the generator deviating from the distribution of previous tasks. To overcome these two issues, we propose a novel approach, called deep diffusion-based generative replay (DDGR), which adopts a diffusion model as the generator and calculates an instruction-operator through the classifier to instruct the generation of samples. Extensive experiments in class incremental (CI) and class incremental with repetition (CIR) settings demonstrate the advantages of DDGR. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiaocangshengGR/DDGR.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gao23e	Rui Gao, Weiwei Liu
On the Impact of Algorithmic Recourse on Social Segregation	As predictive models seep into several real-world applications, it has become critical to ensure that individuals who are negatively impacted by the outcomes of these models are provided with a means for recourse. To this end, there has been a growing body of research on algorithmic recourse in recent years. While recourses can be extremely beneficial to affected individuals, their implementation at a large scale can lead to potential data distribution shifts and other unintended consequences. However, there is little to no research on understanding the impact of algorithmic recourse after implementation. In this work, we address the aforementioned gaps by making one of the first attempts at analyzing the delayed societal impact of algorithmic recourse. To this end, we theoretically and empirically analyze the recourses output by state-of-the-art algorithms. Our analysis demonstrates that large-scale implementation of recourses by end users may exacerbate social segregation. To address this problem, we propose novel algorithms which leverage implicit and explicit conditional generative models to not only minimize the chance of segregation but also provide realistic recourses. Extensive experimentation with real-world datasets demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed approaches.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gao23d	Ruijiang Gao, Himabindu Lakkaraju
Generalizing Neural Wave Functions	Recent neural network-based wave functions have achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in modeling ab-initio ground-state potential energy surface. However, these networks can only solve different spatial arrangements of the same set of atoms. To overcome this limitation, we present Graph-learned orbital embeddings (Globe), a neural network-based reparametrization method that can adapt neural wave functions to different molecules. Globe learns representations of local electronic structures that generalize across molecules via spatial message passing by connecting molecular orbitals to covalent bonds. Further, we propose a size-consistent wave function Ansatz, the Molecular orbital network (Moon), tailored to jointly solve Schrödinger equations of different molecules. In our experiments, we find Moon converging in 4.5 times fewer steps to similar accuracy as previous methods or to lower energies given the same time. Further, our analysis shows that Moon's energy estimate scales additively with increased system sizes, unlike previous work where we observe divergence. In both computational chemistry and machine learning, we are the first to demonstrate that a single wave function can solve the Schrödinger equation of molecules with different atoms jointly.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gao23c	Nicholas Gao, Stephan Günnemann
Gradient Descent Finds the Global Optima of Two-Layer Physics-Informed Neural Networks	The main aim of this paper is to conduct the convergence analysis of the gradient descent for two-layer physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Here, the loss function involves derivatives of neural network outputs with respect to its inputs, so the interaction between the trainable parameters is more complicated compared with simple regression and classification tasks. We first develop the positive definiteness of Gram matrices and prove that the gradient flow finds the global optima of the empirical loss under over-parameterization. Then, we demonstrate that the standard gradient descent converges to the global optima of the loss with proper choices of learning rates. The framework of our analysis works for various categories of PDEs (e.g., linear second-order PDEs) and common types of network initialization (LecunUniform etc.). Our theoretical results do not need a very strict hypothesis for training samples and have a looser requirement on the network width compared with some previous works.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gao23b	Yihang Gao, Yiqi Gu, Michael Ng
Solving Linear Programs with Fast Online Learning Algorithms	This paper presents fast first-order methods for solving linear programs (LPs) approximately. We adapt online linear programming algorithms to offline LPs and obtain algorithms that avoid any matrix multiplication. We also introduce a variable-duplication technique that copies each variable $K$ times and reduces the optimality gap and constraint violation by a factor of $\sqrt{K}$. Furthermore, we show how online algorithms can be effectively integrated into sifting, a column generation scheme for large-scale LPs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods can serve as either an approximate direct solver, or an initialization subroutine for exact LP solving.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gao23a	Wenzhi Gao, Dongdong Ge, Chunlin Sun, Yinyu Ye
Do Perceptually Aligned Gradients Imply Robustness?	Adversarially robust classifiers possess a trait that non-robust models do not - Perceptually Aligned Gradients (PAG). Their gradients with respect to the input align well with human perception. Several works have identified PAG as a byproduct of robust training, but none have considered it as a standalone phenomenon nor studied its own implications. In this work, we focus on this trait and test whether Perceptually Aligned Gradients imply Robustness. To this end, we develop a novel objective to directly promote PAG in training classifiers and examine whether models with such gradients are more robust to adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and architectures validate that models with aligned gradients exhibit significant robustness, exposing the surprising bidirectional connection between PAG and robustness. Lastly, we show that better gradient alignment leads to increased robustness and harness this observation to boost the robustness of existing adversarial training techniques.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ganz23a	Roy Ganz, Bahjat Kawar, Michael Elad
Why Is Public Pretraining Necessary for Private Model Training?	"In the privacy-utility tradeoff of a model trained on benchmark language and vision tasks, remarkable improvements have been widely reported when the model is pretrained on public data. Some gain is expected as these models inherit the benefits of transfer learning, which is the standard motivation in non-private settings. However, the stark contrast in the gain of pretraining between non-private and private machine learning suggests that the gain in the latter is rooted in a fundamentally different cause. To explain this phenomenon, we hypothesize that the non-convex loss landscape of a model training necessitates the optimization algorithm to go through two phases. In the first, the algorithm needs to select a good ""basin"" in the loss landscape. In the second, the algorithm solves an easy optimization within that basin. The former is a harder problem to solve with private data, while the latter is harder to solve with public data due to a distribution shift or data scarcity. Guided by this intuition, we provide theoretical constructions that provably demonstrate the separation between private training with and without public pretraining. Further, systematic experiments on CIFAR10 and Librispeech provide supporting evidence for our hypothesis."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ganesh23a	Arun Ganesh, Mahdi Haghifam, Milad Nasr, Sewoong Oh, Thomas Steinke, Om Thakkar, Abhradeep Guha Thakurta, Lun Wang
Graph Reinforcement Learning for Network Control via Bi-Level Optimization	Optimization problems over dynamic networks have been extensively studied and widely used in the past decades to formulate numerous real-world problems. However, (1) traditional optimization-based approaches do not scale to large networks, and (2) the design of good heuristics or approximation algorithms often requires significant manual trial-and-error. In this work, we argue that data-driven strategies can automate this process and learn efficient algorithms without compromising optimality. To do so, we present network control problems through the lens of reinforcement learning and propose a graph network-based framework to handle a broad class of problems. Instead of naively computing actions over high-dimensional graph elements, e.g., edges, we propose a bi-level formulation where we (1) specify a desired next state via RL, and (2) solve a convex program to best achieve it, leading to drastically improved scalability and performance. We further highlight a collection of desirable features to system designers, investigate design decisions, and present experiments on real-world control problems showing the utility, scalability, and flexibility of our framework.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gammelli23a	Daniele Gammelli, James Harrison, Kaidi Yang, Marco Pavone, Filipe Rodrigues, Francisco C.

Cell-Free Latent Go-Explore	In this paper, we introduce Latent Go-Explore (LGE), a simple and general approach based on the Go-Explore paradigm for exploration in reinforcement learning (RL). Go-Explore was initially introduced with a strong domain knowledge constraint for partitioning the state space into cells. However, in most real-world scenarios, drawing domain knowledge from raw observations is complex and tedious. If the cell partitioning is not informative enough, Go-Explore can completely fail to explore the environment. We argue that the Go-Explore approach can be generalized to any environment without domain knowledge and without cells by exploiting a learned latent representation. Thus, we show that LGE can be flexibly combined with any strategy for learning a latent representation. Our results indicate that LGE, although simpler than Go-Explore, is more robust and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of pure exploration on multiple hard-exploration environments including Montezuma's Revenge. The LGE implementation is available as open-source at https://github.com/qgallouedec/lge.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gallouedec23a	Quentin Gallouédec, Emmanuel Dellandrea
Why Random Pruning Is All We Need to Start Sparse	Random masks define surprisingly effective sparse neural network models, as has been shown empirically. The resulting sparse networks can often compete with dense architectures and state-of-the-art lottery ticket pruning algorithms, even though they do not rely on computationally expensive prune-train iterations and can be drawn initially without significant computational overhead. We offer a theoretical explanation of how random masks can approximate arbitrary target networks if they are wider by a logarithmic factor in the inverse sparsity $1 / \log(1/\text{sparsity})$. This overparameterization factor is necessary at least for 3-layer random networks, which elucidates the observed degrading performance of random networks at higher sparsity. At moderate to high sparsity levels, however, our results imply that sparser networks are contained within random source networks so that any dense-to-sparse training scheme can be turned into a computationally more efficient sparse-to-sparse one by constraining the search to a fixed random mask. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in experiments for different pruning methods and propose particularly effective choices of initial layer-wise sparsity ratios of the random source network. As a special case, we show theoretically and experimentally that random source networks also contain strong lottery tickets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gadhikar23a	Advait Harshal Gadhikar, Sohom Mukherjee, Rebekka Burkholz
Hierarchies of Reward Machines	Reward machines (RMs) are a recent formalism for representing the reward function of a reinforcement learning task through a finite-state machine whose edges encode subgoals of the task using high-level events. The structure of RMs enables the decomposition of a task into simpler and independently solvable subtasks that help tackle long-horizon and/or sparse reward tasks. We propose a formalism for further abstracting the subtask structure by endowing an RM with the ability to call other RMs, thus composing a hierarchy of RMs (HRM). We exploit HRMs by treating each call to an RM as an independently solvable subtask using the options framework, and describe a curriculum-based method to learn HRMs from traces observed by the agent. Our experiments reveal that exploiting a handcrafted HRM leads to faster convergence than with a flat HRM, and that learning an HRM is feasible in cases where its equivalent flat representation is not.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/furelos-blanco23a	Daniel Furelos-Blanco, Mark Law, Anders Jonsson, Krysia Broda, Alessandra Russo
NeRFool: Uncovering the Vulnerability of Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields against Adversarial Perturbations	Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields (GNeRF) are one of the most promising real-world solutions for novel view synthesis, thanks to their cross-scene generalization capability and thus the possibility of instant rendering on new scenes. While adversarial robustness is essential for real-world applications, little study has been devoted to understanding its implication on GNeRF. We hypothesize that because GNeRF is implemented by conditioning on the source views from new scenes, which are often acquired from the Internet or third-party providers, there are potential new security concerns regarding its real-world applications. Meanwhile, existing understanding and solutions for neural networks' adversarial robustness may not be applicable to GNeRF, due to its 3D nature and uniquely diverse operations. To this end, we present NeRFool, which to the best of our knowledge is the first work that sets out to understand the adversarial robustness of GNeRF. Specifically, NeRFool unveils the vulnerability patterns and important insights regarding GNeRF's adversarial robustness. Built upon the above insights gained from NeRFool, we further develop NeRFool$^+$, which integrates two techniques capable of effectively attacking GNeRF across a wide range of target views, and provide guidelines for defending against our proposed attacks. We believe that our NeRFool/NeRFool$^+$ lays the initial foundation for future innovations in developing robust real-world GNeRF solutions.

Meta-learning Parameterized Skills	We propose a novel parameterized skill-learning algorithm that aims to learn transferable parameterized skills and synthesize them into a new action space that supports efficient learning in long-horizon tasks. We propose to leverage off-policy Meta-RL combined with a trajectory-centric smoothness term to learn a set of parameterized skills. Our agent can use these learned skills to construct a three-level hierarchical framework that models a Temporally-extended Parameterized Action Markov Decision Process. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed algorithms enable an agent to solve a set of highly difficult long-horizon (obstacle-course and robot manipulation) tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/fu23f	Haotian Fu, Shangqun Yu, Saket Tiwari, Michael Littman, George Konidaris
Accelerated Stochastic Optimization Methods under Quasar-convexity	Non-convex optimization plays a key role in a growing number of machine learning applications. This motivates the identification of specialized structure that enables sharper theoretical analysis. One such identified structure is quasar-convexity, a non-convex generalization of convexity that subsumes convex functions. Existing algorithms for minimizing quasar-convex functions in the stochastic setting have either high complexity or slow convergence, which prompts us to derive a new class of stochastic methods for optimizing smooth quasar-convex functions. We demonstrate that our algorithms have fast convergence and outperform existing algorithms on several examples, including the classical problem of learning linear dynamical systems. We also present a unified analysis of our newly proposed algorithms and a previously studied deterministic algorithm.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/fu23e	Qiang Fu, Dongchu Xu, Ashia Camage Wilson
Specializing Smaller Language Models towards Multi-Step Reasoning	The surprising ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform well on complex reasoning with only few-shot chain-of-thought prompts is believed to emerge only in very large-scale models. We show that such abilities can, in fact, be distilled down from GPT-3.5 (≥ 175B) to T5 variants (≤ 11B). We propose model specialization, to specialize the model's ability towards a target task. The hypothesis is that large models (commonly viewed as larger than 100B) have strong modeling power such that they can perform a large spectrum of tasks. Small models (commonly viewed as smaller than 10B) have limited model capacity, but if we specialize their capacity towards a target task, the model can achieve decent performance improvements. We use multi-step math reasoning as our testbed because it is a very typical emergent ability. We show two important aspects of model abilities: (1) balancing language model's performance on multiple tasks is a delicate matter, as improvements on one task may compromise other tasks; (2) yet by intentionally paying the price of decreased generic ability, we can clearly improve across different model scales smaller than 10B towards a specialized multi-step math reasoning ability. We further give comprehensive discussions about important design choices for better generalization, including the data format mixture and the start model checkpoint. We hope our practice and discoveries can serve as an important attempt towards specialized smaller models in the new research paradigm set by LLMs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/fu23d	Yao Fu, Hao Peng, Litu Ou, Ashish Sabharwal, Tushar Khot
Go Beyond Imagination: Maximizing Episodic Reachability with World Models	Efficient exploration is a challenging topic in reinforcement learning, especially for sparse reward tasks. To deal with the reward sparsity, people commonly apply intrinsic rewards to motivate agents to explore the state space efficiently. In this paper, we introduce a new intrinsic reward design called GoBI - Go Beyond Imagination, which combines the traditional lifelong novelty motivation with an episodic intrinsic reward that is designed to maximize the stepwise reachability expansion. More specifically, we apply learned world models to generate predicted future states with random actions. States with more unique predictions that are not in episodic memory are assigned high intrinsic rewards. Our method greatly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on 12 of the most challenging Minigrid navigation tasks and improves the sample efficiency on locomotion tasks from DeepMind Control Suite.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/fu23c	Yao Fu, Run Peng, Honglak Lee
MonoNeRF: Learning Generalizable NeRFs from Monocular Videos without Camera Poses	We propose a generalizable neural radiance fields - MonoNeRF, that can be trained on large-scale monocular videos of moving in static scenes without any ground-truth annotations of depth and camera poses. MonoNeRF follows an Autoencoder-based architecture, where the encoder estimates the monocular depth and the camera pose, and the decoder constructs a Multiplane NeRF representation based on the depth encoder feature, and renders the input frames with the estimated camera. The learning is supervised by the reconstruction error. Once the model is learned, it can be applied to multiple applications including depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and single-image novel view synthesis.

Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling	State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions-such as squashing the kernel weights-result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/fu23a	Daniel Y Fu, Elliot L Epstein, Eric Nguyen, Armin W Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, Atri Rudra, Christopher Re
A Coupled Flow Approach to Imitation Learning	In reinforcement learning and imitation learning, an object of central importance is the state distribution induced by the policy. It plays a crucial role in the policy gradient theorem, and references to it–along with the related state-action distribution–can be found all across the literature. Despite its importance, the state distribution is mostly discussed indirectly and theoretically, rather than being modeled explicitly. The reason being an absence of appropriate density estimation tools. In this work, we investigate applications of a normalizing flow based model for the aforementioned distributions. In particular, we use a pair of flows coupled through the optimality point of the Donsker-Varadhan representation of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, for distribution matching based imitation learning. Our algorithm, Coupled Flow Imitation Learning (CFIL), achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark tasks with a single expert trajectory and extends naturally to a variety of other settings, including the subsampled and state-only regimes.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/freund23a	Gideon Joseph Freund, Elad Sarafian, Sarit Kraus
Learning Temporally AbstractWorld Models without Online Experimentation	Agents that can build temporally abstract representations of their environment are better able to understand their world and make plans on extended time scales, with limited computational power and modeling capacity. However, existing methods for automatically learning temporally abstract world models usually require millions of online environmental interactions and incentivize agents to reach every accessible environmental state, which is infeasible for most real-world robots both in terms of data efficiency and hardware safety. In this paper, we present an approach for simultaneously learning sets of skills and temporally abstract, skill-conditioned world models purely from offline data, enabling agents to perform zero-shot online planning of skill sequences for new tasks. We show that our approach performs comparably to or better than a wide array of state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms on a number of simulated robotics locomotion and manipulation benchmarks, while offering a higher degree of adaptability to new goals. Finally, we show that our approach offers a much higher degree of robustness to perturbations in environmental dynamics, compared to policy-based methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/freed23a	Benjamin Freed, Siddarth Venkatraman, Guillaume Adrien Sartoretti, Jeff Schneider, Howie Choset

A Theoretical Analysis of the Learning Dynamics under Class Imbalance	Data imbalance is a common problem in machine learning that can have a critical effect on the performance of a model. Various solutions exist but their impact on the convergence of the learning dynamics is not understood. Here, we elucidate the significant negative impact of data imbalance on learning, showing that the learning curves for minority and majority classes follow sub-optimal trajectories when training with a gradient-based optimizer. This slowdown is related to the imbalance ratio and can be traced back to a competition between the optimization of different classes. Our main contribution is the analysis of the convergence of full-batch (GD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and of variants that renormalize the contribution of each per-class gradient. We find that GD is not guaranteed to decrease the loss for each class but that this problem can be addressed by performing a per-class normalization of the gradient. With SGD, class imbalance has an additional effect on the direction of the gradients: the minority class suffers from a higher directional noise, which reduces the effectiveness of the per-class gradient normalization. Our findings not only allow us to understand the potential and limitations of strategies involving the per-class gradients, but also the reason for the effectiveness of previously used solutions for class imbalancesuch as oversampling.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/francazi23a	Emanuele Francazi, Marco Baity-Jesi, Aurelien Lucchi
Last Switch Dependent Bandits with Monotone Payoff Functions	In a recent work, Laforgue et al. introduce the model of last switch dependent (LSD) bandits, in an attempt to capture nonstationary phenomena induced by the interaction between the player and the environment. Examples include satiation, where consecutive plays of the same action lead to decreased performance, or deprivation, where the payoff of an action increases after an interval of inactivity. In this work, we take a step towards understanding the approximability of planning LSD bandits, namely, the (NP-hard) problem of computing an optimal arm-pulling strategy under complete knowledge of the model. In particular, we design the first efficient constant approximation algorithm for the problem and show that, under a natural monotonicity assumption on the payoffs, its approximation guarantee (almost) matches the state-of-the-art for the special and well-studied class of recharging bandits (also known as delay-dependent). In this attempt, we develop new tools and insights for this class of problems, including a novel higher-dimensional relaxation and the technique of mirroring the evolution of virtual states. We believe that these novel elements could potentially be used for approaching richer classes of action-induced nonstationary bandits (e.g., special instances of restless bandits). In the case where the model parameters are initially unknown, we develop an online learning adaptation of our algorithm for which we provide sublinear regret guarantees against its full-information counterpart.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/foussoul23a	Ayoub Foussoul, Vineet Goyal, Orestis Papadigenopoulos, Assaf Zeevi
Can Forward Gradient Match Backpropagation?	Forward Gradients - the idea of using directional derivatives in forward differentiation mode - have recently been shown to be utilizable for neural network training while avoiding problems generally associated with backpropagation gradient computation, such as locking and memorization requirements. The cost is the requirement to guess the step direction, which is hard in high dimensions. While current solutions rely on weighted averages over isotropic guess vector distributions, we propose to strongly bias our gradient guesses in directions that are much more promising, such as feedback obtained from small, local auxiliary networks. For a standard computer vision neural network, we conduct a rigorous study systematically covering a variety of combinations of gradient targets and gradient guesses, including those previously presented in the literature. We find that using gradients obtained from a local loss as a candidate direction drastically improves on random noise in Forward Gradient methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/fournier23a	Louis Fournier, Stephane Rivaud, Eugene Belilovsky, Michael Eickenberg, Edouard Oyallon
Disentangled Generative Models for Robust Prediction of System Dynamics	The use of deep neural networks for modelling system dynamics is increasingly popular, but long-term prediction accuracy and out-of-distribution generalization still present challenges. In this study, we address these challenges by considering the parameters of dynamical systems as factors of variation of the data and leverage their ground-truth values to disentangle the representations learned by generative models. Our experimental results in phase-space and observation-space dynamics, demonstrate the effectiveness of latent-space supervision in producing disentangled representations, leading to improved long-term prediction accuracy and out-of-distribution robustness.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/fotiadis23a	Stathi Fotiadis, Mario Lino Valencia, Shunlong Hu, Stef Garasto, Chris D Cantwell, Anil Anthony Bharath
Hardness of Independent Learning and Sparse Equilibrium Computation in Markov Games	"We consider the problem of decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning in Markov games. A fundamental question is whether there exist algorithms that, when run independently by all agents, lead to no-regret for each player, analogous to celebrated convergence results for no-regret learning in normal-form games. While recent work has shown that such algorithms exist for restricted settings (notably, when regret is defined with respect to deviations to Markov policies), the question of whether independent no-regret learning can be achieved in the standard Markov game framework was open. We provide a decisive negative resolution to this problem, both from a computational and statistical perspective. We show that: • Under the complexity-theoretic assumption that PPAD $\neq$ P, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that attains no-regret in two-player general-sum Markov games when executed independently by all players, even when the game is known to the algorithm designer. • When the game is unknown, no algorithm, efficient or otherwise, can achieve no-regret without observing exponentially many episodes in the number of players. These results are proven via lower bounds for a simpler problem we refer to as SparseCCE, in which the goal is to compute a coarse correlated equilibrium that is ""sparse"" in the sense that it can be represented as a mixture of a small number of product policies."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/foster23a	Dylan J Foster, Noah Golowich, Sham M.

Explainable Data-Driven Optimization: From Context to Decision and Back Again	Data-driven optimization uses contextual information and machine learning algorithms to find solutions to decision problems with uncertain parameters. While a vast body of work is dedicated to interpreting machine learning models in the classification setting, explaining decision pipelines involving learning algorithms remains unaddressed. This lack of interpretability can block the adoption of data-driven solutions as practitioners may not understand or trust the recommended decisions. We bridge this gap by introducing a counterfactual explanation methodology tailored to explain solutions to data-driven problems. We introduce two classes of explanations and develop methods to find nearest explanations of random forest and nearest-neighbor predictors. We demonstrate our approach by explaining key problems in operations management such as inventory management and routing.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/forel23a	Alexandre Forel, Axel Parmentier, Thibaut Vidal
ACAT: Adversarial Counterfactual Attention for Classification and Detection in Medical Imaging	In some medical imaging tasks and other settings where only small parts of the image are informative for the classification task, traditional CNNs can sometimes struggle to generalise. Manually annotated Regions of Interest (ROI) are often used to isolate the most informative parts of the image. However, these are expensive to collect and may vary significantly across annotators. To overcome these issues, we propose a framework that employs saliency maps to obtain soft spatial attention masks that modulate the image features at different scales.

User-defined Event Sampling and Uncertainty Quantification in Diffusion Models for Physical Dynamical Systems	Diffusion models are a class of probabilistic generative models that have been widely used as a prior for image processing tasks like text conditional generation and inpainting. We demonstrate that these models can be adapted to make predictions and provide uncertainty quantification for chaotic dynamical systems. In these applications, diffusion models can implicitly represent knowledge about outliers and extreme events; however, querying that knowledge through conditional sampling or measuring probabilities is surprisingly difficult. Existing methods for conditional sampling at inference time seek mainly to enforce the constraints, which is insufficient to match the statistics of the distribution or compute the probability of the chosen events. To achieve these ends, optimally one would use the conditional score function, but its computation is typically intractable. In this work, we develop a probabilistic approximation scheme for the conditional score function which provably converges to the true distribution as the noise level decreases. With this scheme we are able to sample conditionally on nonlinear user-defined events at inference time, and matches data statistics even when sampling from the tails of the distribution.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/finzi23a	Marc Anton Finzi, Anudhyan Boral, Andrew Gordon Wilson, Fei Sha, Leonardo Zepeda-Nunez
Adapting to game trees in zero-sum imperfect information games	Imperfect information games (IIG) are games in which each player only partially observes the current game state. We study how to learn $\epsilon$-optimal strategies in a zero-sum IIG through self-play with trajectory feedback. We give a problem-independent lower bound $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H(A_{\mathcal{X}}+B_{\mathcal{Y}})/\epsilon^2)$ on the required number of realizations to learn these strategies with high probability, where $H$ is the length of the game, $A_{\mathcal{X}}$ and $B_{\mathcal{Y}}$ are the total number of actions for the two players. We also propose two Follow the Regularized leader (FTRL) algorithms for this setting: Balanced FTRL which matches this lower bound, but requires the knowledge of the information set structure beforehand to define the regularization; and Adaptive FTRL which needs $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^2(A_{\mathcal{X}}+B_{\mathcal{Y}})/\epsilon^2)$ realizations without this requirement by progressively adapting the regularization to the observations.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/fiegel23a	Côme Fiegel, Pierre Menard, Tadashi Kozuno, Remi Munos, Vianney Perchet, Michal Valko
Constant Matters: Fine-grained Error Bound on Differentially Private Continual Observation	We study fine-grained error bounds for differentially private algorithms for counting under continual observation. Our main insight is that the matrix mechanism when using lower-triangular matrices can be used in the continual observation model. More specifically, we give an explicit factorization for the counting matrix $M_\mathsf{count}$ and upper bound the error explicitly. We also give a fine-grained analysis, specifying the exact constant in the upper bound. Our analysis is based on upper and lower bounds of the	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/fichtenberger23a	Hendrik Fichtenberger, Monika Henzinger, Jalaj Upadhyay
Scaling Laws for Multilingual Neural Machine Translation	"In this work, we provide a large-scale empirical study of the scaling properties of multilingual neural machine translation models. We examine how increases in the model size affect the model performance and investigate the role of the individual language pair weights on the scaling behavior. We find that these weights only affect the multiplicative factor of the scaling law, and in particular, the scaling exponent is unaffected by them. Through a novel joint scaling law formulation, we compute the effective number of parameters allocated to each language pair and examine the role of language similarity in the scaling behavior of our models. We find little evidence that language similarity has any impact. In contrast, ""direction"" of the multilinguality plays a significant role, with models translating from multiple languages into English having a larger number of effective parameters per task than their reversed counterparts. Finally, we leverage our observations to predict the performance of multilingual models trained with any language weighting at any scale, greatly reducing efforts required for language balancing in large multilingual models. Our findings apply to both in-domain and out-of-domain test sets and to multiple evaluation metrics, such as ChrF and BLEURT."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/fernandes23a	Patrick Fernandes, Behrooz Ghorbani, Xavier Garcia, Markus Freitag, Orhan Firat
SurCo: Learning Linear SURrogates for COmbinatorial Nonlinear Optimization Problems	Optimization problems with nonlinear cost functions and combinatorial constraints appear in many real-world applications but remain challenging to solve efficiently compared to their linear counterparts. To bridge this gap, we propose $\textbf{\emph{\texttt{SurCo}}}$ that learns linear $\underline{\text{Sur}}$rogate costs which can be used in existing $\underline{\text{Co}}$mbinatorial solvers to output good solutions to the original nonlinear combinatorial optimization problem. The surrogate costs are learned end-to-end with nonlinear loss by differentiating through the linear surrogate solver, combining the flexibility of gradient-based methods with the structure of linear combinatorial optimization. We propose three $\texttt{SurCo}$ variants: $\texttt{SurCo}-\texttt{zero}$ for individual nonlinear problems, $\texttt{SurCo}-\texttt{prior}$ for problem distributions, and $\texttt{SurCo}-\texttt{hybrid}$ to combine both distribution and problem-specific information. We give theoretical intuition motivating $\texttt{SurCo}$, and evaluate it empirically. Experiments show that $\texttt{SurCo}$ finds better solutions faster than state-of-the-art and domain expert approaches in real-world optimization problems such as embedding table sharding, inverse photonic design, and nonlinear route planning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ferber23a	Aaron M Ferber, Taoan Huang, Daochen Zha, Martin Schubert, Benoit Steiner, Bistra Dilkina, Yuandong Tian
Random Matrix Analysis to Balance between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning under the Low Density Separation Assumption	We propose a theoretical framework to analyze semi-supervised classification under the low density separation assumption in a high-dimensional regime. In particular, we introduce QLDS, a linear classification model, where the low density separation assumption is implemented via quadratic margin maximization. The algorithm has an explicit solution with rich theoretical properties, and we show that particular cases of our algorithm are the least-square support vector machine in the supervised case, the spectral clustering in the fully unsupervised regime, and a class of semi-supervised graph-based approaches. As such, QLDS establishes a smooth bridge between these supervised and unsupervised learning methods. Using recent advances in the random matrix theory, we formally derive a theoretical evaluation of the classification error in the asymptotic regime. As an application, we derive a hyperparameter selection policy that finds the best balance between the supervised and the unsupervised terms of our learning criterion. Finally, we provide extensive illustrations of our framework, as well as an experimental study on several benchmarks to demonstrate that QLDS, while being computationally more efficient, improves over cross-validation for hyperparameter selection, indicating a high promise of the usage of random matrix theory for semi-supervised model selection.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/feofanov23a	Vasilii Feofanov, Malik Tiomoko, Aladin Virmaux
Non-stationary Reinforcement Learning under General Function Approximation	General function approximation is a powerful tool to handle large state and action spaces in a broad range of reinforcement learning (RL) scenarios. However, theoretical understanding of non-stationary MDPs with general function approximation is still limited. In this paper, we make the first such an attempt. We first propose a new complexity metric called dynamic Bellman Eluder (DBE) dimension for non-stationary MDPs, which subsumes majority of existing tractable RL problems in static MDPs as well as non-stationary MDPs. Based on the proposed complexity metric, we propose a novel confidence-set based model-free algorithm called SW-OPEA, which features a sliding window mechanism and a new confidence set design for non-stationary MDPs. We then establish an upper bound on the dynamic regret for the proposed algorithm, and show that SW-OPEA is provably efficient as long as the variation budget is not significantly large. We further demonstrate via examples of non-stationary linear and tabular MDPs that our algorithm performs better in small variation budget scenario than the existing UCB-type algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dynamic regret analysis in non-stationary MDPs with general function approximation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/feng23e	Songtao Feng, Ming Yin, Ruiquan Huang, Yu-Xiang Wang, Jing Yang, Yingbin Liang
Improved Algorithms for White-Box Adversarial Streams	We study streaming algorithms in the white-box adversarial stream model, where the internal state of the streaming algorithm is revealed to an adversary who adaptively generates the stream updates, but the algorithm obtains fresh randomness unknown to the adversary at each time step. We incorporate cryptographic assumptions to construct robust algorithms against such adversaries. We propose efficient algorithms for sparse recovery of vectors, low rank recovery of matrices and tensors, as well as low rank plus sparse recovery of matrices, i.e., robust PCA. Unlike deterministic algorithms, our algorithms can report when the input is not sparse or low rank even in the presence of such an adversary. We use these recovery algorithms to improve upon and solve new problems in numerical linear algebra and combinatorial optimization on white-box adversarial streams. For example, we give the first efficient algorithm for outputting a matching in a graph with insertions and deletions to its edges provided the matching size is small, and otherwise we declare the matching size is large. We also improve the approximation versus memory tradeoff of previous work for estimating the number of non-zero elements in a vector and computing the matrix rank.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/feng23d	Ying Feng, David Woodruff
Fractional Denoising for 3D Molecular Pre-training	Coordinate denoising is a promising 3D molecular pre-training method, which has achieved remarkable performance in various downstream drug discovery tasks. Theoretically, the objective is equivalent to learning the force field, which is revealed helpful for downstream tasks. Nevertheless, there are two challenges for coordinate denoising to learn an effective force field, i.e. low coverage samples and isotropic force field. The underlying reason is that molecular distributions assumed by existing denoising methods fail to capture the anisotropic characteristic of molecules. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid noise strategy, including noises on both dihedral angel and coordinate. However, denoising such hybrid noise in a traditional way is no more equivalent to learning the force field. Through theoretical deductions, we find that the problem is caused by the dependency of the input conformation for covariance. To this end, we propose to decouple the two types of noise and design a novel fractional denoising method (Frad), which only denoises the latter coordinate part. In this way, Frad enjoys both the merits of sampling more low-energy structures and the force field equivalence. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of Frad in molecule representation, with a new state-of-the-art on 9 out of 12 tasks of QM9 and on 7 out of 8 targets of MD17.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/feng23c	Shikun Feng, Yuyan Ni, Yanyan Lan, Zhi-Ming Ma, Wei-Ying Ma
Improved Online Learning Algorithms for CTR Prediction in Ad Auctions	In this work, we investigate the online learning problem of revenue maximization in ad auctions, where the seller needs to learn the click-through rates (CTRs) of each ad candidate and charge the price of the winner through a pay-per-click manner. We focus on two models of the advertisers' strategic behaviors. First, we assume that the advertiser is completely myopic; i.e. in each round, they aim to maximize their utility only for the current round. In this setting, we develop an online mechanism based on upper-confidence bounds that achieves a tight $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret in the worst-case and negative regret when the values are static across all the auctions and there is a gap between the highest expected value (i.e. value multiplied by their CTR) and second highest expected value ad. Next, we assume that the advertiser is non-myopic and cares about their long term utility. This setting is much more complex since an advertiser is incentivized to influence the mechanism by bidding strategically in earlier rounds. In this setting, we provide an algorithm to achieve negative regret for the static valuation setting (with a positive gap), which is in sharp contrast with the prior work that shows $O(T^{2/3})$ regret when the valuation is generated by adversary.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/feng23b	Zhe Feng, Christopher Liaw, Zixin Zhou
Weighted Sampling without Replacement for Deep Top-$k$ Classification	The top-$k$ classification accuracy is a crucial metric in machine learning and is often used to evaluate the performance of deep neural networks. These networks are typically trained using the cross-entropy loss, which optimizes for top-$1$ classification and is considered optimal in the case of infinite data. However, in real-world scenarios, data is often noisy and limited, leading to the need for more robust losses. In this paper, we propose using the Weighted Sampling Without Replacement (WSWR) method as a learning objective for top-$k$ loss.

Why Target Networks Stabilise Temporal Difference Methods	"Integral to recent successes in deep reinforcement learning has been a class of temporal difference methods that use infrequently updated target values for policy evaluation in a Markov Decision Process. Yet a complete theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of target networks remains elusive. In this work, we provide an analysis of this popular class of algorithms, to finally answer the question: ""why do target networks stabilise TD learning""? To do so, we formalise the notion of a partially fitted policy evaluation method, which describes the use of target networks and bridges the gap between fitted methods and semigradient temporal difference algorithms. Using this framework we are able to uniquely characterise the so-called deadly triad–the use of TD updates with (nonlinear) function approximation and off-policy data–which often leads to nonconvergent algorithms.This insight leads us to conclude that the use of target networks can mitigate the effects of poor conditioning in the Jacobian of the TD update. Instead, we show that under mild regularity con- ditions and a well tuned target network update frequency, convergence can be guaranteed even in the extremely challenging off-policy sampling and nonlinear function approximation setting."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/fellows23a	Mattie Fellows, Matthew J.

Parallel Neurosymbolic Integration with Concordia	Parallel neurosymbolic architectures have been applied effectively in NLP by distilling knowledge from a logic theory into a deep model. However, prior art faces several limitations including supporting restricted forms of logic theories and relying on the assumption of independence between the logic and the deep network. We present Concordia, a framework overcoming the limitations of prior art. Concordia is agnostic both to the deep network and the logic theory offering support for a wide range of probabilistic theories. Our framework can support supervised training of both components and unsupervised training of the neural component. Concordia has been successfully applied to tasks beyond NLP and data classification, improving the accuracy of state-of-the-art on collective activity detection, entity linking and recommendation tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/feldstein23a	Jonathan Feldstein, Modestas Jurčius, Efthymia Tsamoura
Stochastic Policy Gradient Methods: Improved Sample Complexity for Fisher-non-degenerate Policies	Recently, the impressive empirical success of policy gradient (PG) methods has catalyzed the development of their theoretical foundations. Despite the huge efforts directed at the design of efficient stochastic PG-type algorithms, the understanding of their convergence to a globally optimal policy is still limited. In this work, we develop improved global convergence guarantees for a general class of Fisher-non-degenerate parameterized policies which allows to address the case of continuous state action spaces. First, we propose a Normalized Policy Gradient method with Implicit Gradient Transport (N-PG-IGT) and derive a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2.5})$ sample complexity of this method for finding a global $\varepsilon$-optimal policy. Improving over the previously known $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ complexity, this algorithm does not require the use of importance sampling or second-order information and samples only one trajectory per iteration. Second, we further improve this complexity to $\tilde{ \mathcal{\mathcal{O}} }(\varepsilon^{-2})$ by considering a Hessian-Aided Recursive Policy Gradient ((N)-HARPG) algorithm enhanced with a correction based on a Hessian-vector product. Interestingly, both algorithms are $(i)$ simple and easy to implement: single-loop, do not require large batches of trajectories and sample at most two trajectories per iteration; $(ii)$ computationally and memory efficient: they do not require expensive subroutines at each iteration and can be implemented with memory linear in the dimension of parameters.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/fatkhullin23a	Ilyas Fatkhullin, Anas Barakat, Anastasia Kireeva, Niao He
Neural FIM for learning Fisher information metrics from point cloud data	Although data diffusion embeddings are ubiquitous in unsupervised learning and have proven to be a viable technique for uncovering the underlying intrinsic geometry of data, diffusion embeddings are inherently limited due to their discrete nature. To this end, we propose neural FIM, a method for computing the Fisher information metric (FIM) from point cloud data - allowing for a continuous manifold model for the data. Neural FIM creates an extensible metric space from discrete point cloud data such that information from the metric can inform us of manifold characteristics such as volume and geodesics. We demonstrate Neural FIM's utility in selecting parameters for the PHATE visualization method as well as its ability to obtain information pertaining to local volume illuminating branching points and cluster centers embeddings of a toy dataset and two single-cell datasets of IPSC reprogramming and PBMCs (immune cells).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/fasina23a	Oluwadamilola Fasina, Guillaume Huguet, Alexander Tong, Yanlei Zhang, Guy Wolf, Maximilian Nickel, Ian Adelstein, Smita Krishnaswamy
Robust Collaborative Learning with Linear Gradient Overhead	Collaborative learning algorithms, such as distributed SGD (or D-SGD), are prone to faulty machines that may deviate from their prescribed algorithm because of software or hardware bugs, poisoned data or malicious behaviors. While many solutions have been proposed to enhance the robustness of D-SGD to such machines, previous works either resort to strong assumptions (trusted server, homogeneous data, specific noise model) or impose a gradient computational cost that is several orders of magnitude higher than that of D-SGD. We present MoNNA, a new algorithm that (a) is provably robust under standard assumptions and (b) has a gradient computation overhead that is linear in the fraction of faulty machines, which is conjectured to be tight. Essentially, MoNNA uses Polyak's momentum of local gradients for local updates and nearest-neighbor averaging (NNA) for global mixing, respectively. While MoNNA is rather simple to implement, its analysis has been more challenging and relies on two key elements that may be of independent interest. Specifically, we introduce the mixing criterion of $(\alpha, \lambda)$-reduction to analyze the non-linear mixing of non-faulty machines, and present a way to control the tension between the momentum and the model drifts. We validate our theory by experiments on image classification and make our code available at https://github.com/LPD-EPFL/robust-collaborative-learning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/farhadkhani23a	Sadegh Farhadkhani, Rachid Guerraoui, Nirupam Gupta, Lê-Nguyên Hoang, Rafael Pinot, John Stephan
Regression with Label Permutation in Generalized Linear Model	"The assumption that response and predictor belong to the same statistical unit may be violated in practice. Unbiased estimation and recovery of true label ordering based on unlabeled data are challenging tasks and have attracted increasing attentions in the recent literature. In this paper, we present a relatively complete analysis of label permutation problem for the generalized linear model with multivariate responses. The theory is established under different scenarios, with knowledge of true parameters, with partial knowledge of underlying label permutation matrix and without any knowledge. Our results remove the stringent conditions required by the current literature and are further extended to the missing observation setting which has never been considered in the field of label permutation problem. On computational side, we propose two methods, ""maximum likelihood estimation"" algorithm and ""two-step estimation"" algorithm, to accommodate for different settings. When the proportion of permuted labels is moderate, both methods work effectively. Multiple numerical experiments are provided and corroborate our theoretical findings."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/fang23a	Guanhua Fang, Ping Li
The Fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transform Is Even Faster	The Johnson-Lindenstaruss lemma (Johnson & Lindenstrauss, 1984) is a cornerstone result in dimensionality reduction, stating it is possible to embed a set of $n$ points in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space into optimal $k=O(\varepsilon^{-2} \ln n)$ dimensions, while preserving all pairwise distances to within a factor $(1 \pm \varepsilon)$. The seminal Fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss (Fast JL) transform by Ailon and Chazelle (SICOMP'09) supports computing the embedding of a data point in $O(d \ln d +k \ln^2 n)$ time, where the $d \ln d$ term comes from multiplication with a $d \times d$ Hadamard matrix and the $k \ln^2 n$ term comes from multiplication with a sparse $k \times d$ matrix. Despite the Fast JL transform being more than a decade old, it is one of the fastest dimensionality reduction techniques for many tradeoffs between $\varepsilon, d$ and $n$. In this work, we give a surprising new analysis of the Fast JL transform, showing that the $k \ln^2 n$ term in the embedding time can be improved to $(k \ln^2 n)/\alpha$ for an $\alpha = \Omega(\min\{\varepsilon^{-1}\ln(1/\varepsilon), \ln n\})$. The improvement follows by using an even sparser matrix. We complement our improved analysis with a lower bound showing that our new analysis is in fact tight.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/fandina23a	Ora Nova Fandina, Mikael Møller Høgsgaard, Kasper Green Larsen
General Covariance Data Augmentation for Neural PDE Solvers	The growing body of research shows how to replace classical partial differential equation (PDE) integrators with neural networks. The popular strategy is to generate the input-output pairs with a PDE solver, train the neural network in the regression setting, and use the trained model as a cheap surrogate for the solver. The bottleneck in this scheme is the number of expensive queries of a PDE solver needed to generate the dataset. To alleviate the problem, we propose a computationally cheap augmentation strategy based on general covariance and simple random coordinate transformations. Our approach relies on the fact that physical laws are independent of the coordinate choice, so the change in the coordinate system preserves the type of a parametric PDE and only changes PDE's data (e.g., initial conditions, diffusion coefficient). For tried neural networks and partial differential equations, proposed augmentation improves test error by 23% on average. The worst observed result is a 17% increase in test error for multilayer perceptron, and the best case is a 80% decrease for dilated residual network.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/fanaskov23a	Vladimir Fanaskov, Tianchi Yu, Alexander Rudikov, Ivan Oseledets
Smart Initial Basis Selection for Linear Programs	The simplex method, introduced by Dantzig more than half a century ago, is still to date one of the most efficient methods for solving large-scale linear programming (LP) problems. While the simplex method is known to have the finite termination property under mild assumptions, the number of iterations until optimality largely depends on the choice of initial basis. Existing strategies for selecting an advanced initial basis are mostly rule-based. These rules usually require extensive expert knowledge and empirical study to develop. Yet, many of them fail to exhibit consistent improvement, even for LP problems that arise in a single application scenario. In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach for initial basis selection. We employ graph neural networks as a building block and develop a model that attempts to capture the relationship between LP problems and their optimal bases. In addition, during the inference phase, we supplement the learning-based prediction with linear algebra tricks to ensure the validity of the generated initial basis. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed strategy by extensively testing it with state-of-the-art simplex solvers, including the open-source solver HiGHS and the commercial solver OptVerse. Through these rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that our strategy achieves substantial speedup and consistently outperforms existing rule-based methods. Furthermore, we extend the proposed approach to generating restricted master problems for column generation methods and present encouraging numerical results.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/fan23d	Zhenan Fan, Xinglu Wang, Oleksandr Yakovenko, Abdullah Ali Sivas, Owen Ren, Yong Zhang, Zirui Zhou
LSDS++ : Dual Sampling for Accelerated k-means++	k-means clustering is an important problem in machine learning and statistics. The k-means++ initialization algorithm has driven new acceleration strategies and theoretical analysis for solving the k-means clustering problem. The state-of-the-art variant, called LocalSearch++, adds extra local search steps upon k-means++ to achieve constant approximation error in expectation. In this paper, we propose a new variant named LSDS++, which improves the sampling efficiency of LocalSearch++ via a strategy called dual sampling. By defining a new capture graph based on the concept of coreset, we show that the proposed LSDS++ is able to achieve the same expected constant error with reduced complexity. Experiments are conducted to justify the benefit of LSDS++ in practice.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/fan23c	Chenglin Fan, Ping Li, Xiaoyun Li
Optimizing DDPM Sampling with Shortcut Fine-Tuning	In this study, we propose Shortcut Fine-Tuning (SFT), a new approach for addressing the challenge of fast sampling of pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SFT advocates for the fine-tuning of DDPM samplers through the direct minimization of Integral Probability Metrics (IPM), instead of learning the backward diffusion process. This enables samplers to discover an alternative and more efficient sampling shortcut, deviating from the backward diffusion process. Inspired by a control perspective, we propose a new algorithm SFT-PG: Shortcut Fine-Tuning with Policy Gradient, and prove that under certain assumptions, gradient descent of diffusion models with respect to IPM is equivalent to performing policy gradient. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize reinforcement learning (RL) methods to train diffusion models. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our fine-tuning method can further enhance existing fast DDPM samplers, resulting in sample quality comparable to or even surpassing that of the full-step model across various datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/fan23b	Ying Fan, Kangwook Lee
Free-Form Variational Inference for Gaussian Process State-Space Models	Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) provide a principled and flexible approach to modeling the dynamics of a latent state, which is observed at discrete-time points via a likelihood model. However, inference in GPSSMs is computationally and statistically challenging due to the large number of latent variables in the model and the strong temporal dependencies between them. In this paper, we propose a new method for inference in Bayesian GPSSMs, which overcomes the drawbacks of previous approaches, namely over-simplified assumptions, and high computational requirements. Our method is based on free-form variational inference via stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo within the inducing-variable formalism. Furthermore, by exploiting our proposed variational distribution, we provide a collapsed extension of our method where the inducing variables are marginalized analytically. We also showcase results when combining our framework with particle MCMC methods. We show that, on six real-world datasets, our approach can learn transition dynamics and latent states more accurately than competing methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/fan23a	Xuhui Fan, Edwin V.

Predicting Rare Events by Shrinking Towards Proportional Odds	Training classifiers is difficult with severe class imbalance, but many rare events are the culmination of a sequence with much more common intermediate outcomes. For example, in online marketing a user first sees an ad, then may click on it, and finally may make a purchase; estimating the probability of purchases is difficult because of their rarity. We show both theoretically and through data experiments that the more abundant data in earlier steps may be leveraged to improve estimation of probabilities of rare events. We present PRESTO, a relaxation of the proportional odds model for ordinal regression. Instead of estimating weights for one separating hyperplane that is shifted by separate intercepts for each of the estimated Bayes decision boundaries between adjacent pairs of categorical responses, we estimate separate weights for each of these transitions. We impose an L1 penalty on the differences between weights for the same feature in adjacent weight vectors in order to shrink towards the proportional odds model. We prove that PRESTO consistently estimates the decision boundary weights under a sparsity assumption. Synthetic and real data experiments show that our method can estimate rare probabilities in this setting better than both logistic regression on the rare category, which fails to borrow strength from more abundant categories, and the proportional odds model, which is too inflexible.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/faletto23a	Gregory Faletto, Jacob Bien
Learning Rate Schedules in the Presence of Distribution Shift	We design learning rate schedules that minimize regret for SGD-based online learning in the presence of a changing data distribution. We fully characterize the optimal learning rate schedule for online linear regression via a novel analysis with stochastic differential equations. For general convex loss functions, we propose new learning rate schedules that are robust to distribution shift, and give upper and lower bounds for the regret that only differ by constants. For non-convex loss functions, we define a notion of regret based on the gradient norm of the estimated models and propose a learning schedule that minimizes an upper bound on the total expected regret. Intuitively, one expects changing loss landscapes to require more exploration, and we confirm that optimal learning rate schedules typically have higher learning rates in the presence of distribution shift. Finally, we provide experiments that illustrate these learning rate schedules and their regret.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/fahrbach23a	Matthew Fahrbach, Adel Javanmard, Vahab Mirrokni, Pratik Worah
Neural Status Registers	We study the problem of learning comparisons between numbers with neural networks. Despite comparisons being a seemingly simple problem, we find that both general-purpose models such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) as well as arithmetic architectures such as the Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit (NALU) struggle with learning comparisons. Neither architecture can extrapolate to much larger numbers than those seen in the training set. We propose a novel differentiable architecture, the Neural Status Register (NSR) to solve this problem. We experimentally validate the NSR in various settings. We can combine the NSR with other neural models to solve interesting problems such as piecewise-defined arithmetic, comparison of digit images, recurrent problems, or finding shortest paths in graphs. The NSR outperforms all baseline architectures, especially when it comes to extrapolating to larger numbers.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/faber23a	Lukas Faber, Roger Wattenhofer
A Connection between One-Step RL and Critic Regularization in Reinforcement Learning	As with any machine learning problem with limited data, effective offline RL algorithms require careful regularization to avoid overfitting. One class of methods, known as one-step RL, perform just one step of policy improvement. These methods, which include advantage-weighted regression and conditional behavioral cloning, are thus simple and stable, but can have limited asymptotic performance. A second class of methods, known as critic regularization, perform many steps of policy improvement with a regularized objective. These methods typically require more compute but have appealing lower-bound guarantees. In this paper, we draw a connection between these methods: applying a multi-step critic regularization method with a regularization coefficient of 1 yields the same policy as one-step RL. While our theoretical results require assumptions (e.g., deterministic dynamics), our experiments nevertheless show that our analysis makes accurate, testable predictions about practical offline RL methods (CQL and one-step RL) with commonly-used hyperparameters.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/eysenbach23a	Benjamin Eysenbach, Matthieu Geist, Sergey Levine, Ruslan Salakhutdinov
Continual Learning in Linear Classification on Separable Data	We analyze continual learning on a sequence of separable linear classification tasks with binary labels. We show theoretically that learning with weak regularization reduces to solving a sequential max-margin problem, corresponding to a special case of the Projection Onto Convex Sets (POCS) framework. We then develop upper bounds on the forgetting and other quantities of interest under various settings with recurring tasks, including cyclic and random orderings of tasks. We discuss several practical implications to popular training practices like regularization scheduling and weighting. We point out several theoretical differences between our continual classification setting and a recently studied continual regression setting.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/evron23a	Itay Evron, Edward Moroshko, Gon Buzaglo, Maroun Khriesh, Badea Marjieh, Nathan Srebro, Daniel Soudry
Stochastic Gradient Descent under Markovian Sampling Schemes	We study a variation of vanilla stochastic gradient descent where the optimizer only has access to a Markovian sampling scheme. These schemes encompass applications that range from decentralized optimization with a random walker (token algorithms), to RL and online system identification problems. We focus on obtaining rates of convergence under the least restrictive assumptions possible on the underlying Markov chain and on the functions optimized. We first unveil the theoretical lower bound for methods that sample stochastic gradients along the path of a Markov chain, making appear a dependency in the hitting time of the underlying Markov chain. We then study Markov chain SGD (MC-SGD) under much milder regularity assumptions than prior works. We finally introduce MC-SAG, an alternative to MC-SGD with variance reduction, that only depends on the hitting time of the Markov chain, therefore obtaining a communication-efficient token algorithm.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/even23a	Mathieu Even
Scaling Spherical CNNs	Spherical CNNs generalize CNNs to functions on the sphere, by using spherical convolutions as the main linear operation. The most accurate and efficient way to compute spherical convolutions is in the spectral domain (via the convolution theorem), which is still costlier than the usual planar convolutions. For this reason, applications of spherical CNNs have so far been limited to small problems that can be approached with low model capacity. In this work, we show how spherical CNNs can be scaled for much larger problems. To achieve this, we make critical improvements including novel variants of common model components, an implementation of core operations to exploit hardware accelerator characteristics, and application-specific input representations that exploit the properties of our model. Experiments show our larger spherical CNNs reach state-of-the-art on several targets of the QM9 molecular benchmark, which was previously dominated by equivariant graph neural networks, and achieve competitive performance on multiple weather forecasting tasks.

Delayed Bandits: When Do Intermediate Observations Help?	We study a $K$-armed bandit with delayed feedback and intermediate observations. We consider a model, where intermediate observations have a form of a finite state, which is observed immediately after taking an action, whereas the loss is observed after an adversarially chosen delay. We show that the regime of the mapping of states to losses determines the complexity of the problem, irrespective of whether the mapping of actions to states is stochastic or adversarial. If the mapping of states to losses is adversarial, then the regret rate is of order $\sqrt{(K+d)T}$ (within log factors), where $T$ is the time horizon and $d$ is a fixed delay. This matches the regret rate of a $K$-armed bandit with delayed feedback and without intermediate observations, implying that intermediate observations are not helpful. However, if the mapping of states to losses is stochastic, we show that the regret grows at a rate of $\sqrt{\big(K+\min\\{|\mathcal{S}|,d\\}\big)T}$ (within log factors), implying that if the number $|\mathcal{S}|$ of states is smaller than the delay, then intermediate observations help. We also provide refined high-probability regret upper bounds for non-uniform delays, together with experimental validation of our algorithms.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/esposito23a	Emmanuel Esposito, Saeed Masoudian, Hao Qiu, Dirk Van Der Hoeven, Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Yevgeny Seldin
Regret Minimization and Convergence to Equilibria in General-sum Markov Games	An abundance of recent impossibility results establish that regret minimization in Markov games with adversarial opponents is both statistically and computationally intractable. Nevertheless, none of these results preclude the possibility of regret minimization under the assumption that all parties adopt the same learning procedure. In this work, we present the first (to our knowledge) algorithm for learning in general-sum Markov games that provides sublinear regret guarantees when executed by all agents. The bounds we obtain are for $\textit{swap regret}$, and thus, along the way, imply convergence to a $\textit{correlated}$ equilibrium. Our algorithm is decentralized, computationally efficient, and does not require any communication between agents. Our key observation is that online learning via policy optimization in Markov games essentially reduces to a form of $\textit{weighted}$ regret minimization, with $\textit{unknown}$ weights determined by the path length of the agents' policy sequence. Consequently, controlling the path length leads to weighted regret objectives for which sufficiently adaptive algorithms provide sublinear regret guarantees.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/erez23a	Liad Erez, Tal Lancewicki, Uri Sherman, Tomer Koren, Yishay Mansour
Learning Perturbations to Explain Time Series Predictions	Explaining predictions based on multivariate time series data carries the additional difficulty of handling not only multiple features, but also time dependencies. It matters not only what happened, but also when, and the same feature could have a very different impact on a prediction depending on this time information. Previous work has used perturbation-based saliency methods to tackle this issue, perturbing an input using a trainable mask to discover which features at which times are driving the predictions. However these methods introduce fixed perturbations, inspired from similar methods on static data, while there seems to be little motivation to do so on temporal data. In this work, we aim to explain predictions by learning not only masks, but also associated perturbations. We empirically show that learning these perturbations significantly improves the quality of these explanations on time series data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/enguehard23a	Joseph Enguehard
Motion Question Answering via Modular Motion Programs	In order to build artificial intelligence systems that can perceive and reason with human behavior in the real world, we must first design models that conduct complex spatio-temporal reasoning over motion sequences. Moving towards this goal, we propose the HumanMotionQA task to evaluate complex, multi-step reasoning abilities of models on long-form human motion sequences. We generate a dataset of question-answer pairs that require detecting motor cues in small portions of motion sequences, reasoning temporally about when events occur, and querying specific motion attributes. In addition, we propose NSPose, a neuro-symbolic method for this task that uses symbolic reasoning and a modular design to ground motion through learning motion concepts, attribute neural operators, and temporal relations. We demonstrate the suitability of NSPose for the HumanMotionQA task, outperforming all baseline methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/endo23a	Mark Endo, Joy Hsu, Jiaman Li, Jiajun Wu
A new near-linear time algorithm for k-nearest neighbor search using a compressed cover tree	Given a reference set R of n points and a query set Q of m points in a metric space, this paper studies an important problem of finding k-nearest neighbors of every point q of Q in the set R in a near-linear time. In the paper at ICML 2006, Beygelzimer, Kakade, and Langford introduced a cover tree and attempted to prove that this tree can be built in O(n log n) time while the nearest neighbor search can be done O(n log m) time with a hidden dimensionality factor. In 2015, section 5.3 of Curtin's PhD pointed out that the proof of the latter claim can have a serious gap in time complexity estimation. A paper at TopoInVis 2022 reported explicit counterexamples for a key step in the proofs of both claims. The past obstacles will be overcome by a simpler compressed cover tree on the reference set R. The first new algorithm constructs a compressed cover tree in O(n log n) time. The second new algorithm finds all k-nearest neighbors of all points from Q using a compressed cover tree in time O(m(k+log n)log k) with a hidden dimensionality factor depending on point distributions of the sets R,Q but not on their sizes.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/elkin23a	Yury Elkin, Vitaliy Kurlin
Phase Transitions in the Detection of Correlated Databases	We study the problem of detecting the correlation between two Gaussian databases $\mathsf{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ and $\mathsf{Y}^{n\times d}$, each composed of $n$ users with $d$ features. This problem is relevant in the analysis of social media, computational biology, etc. We formulate this as a hypothesis testing problem: under the null hypothesis, these two databases are statistically independent. Under the alternative, however, there exists an unknown permutation $\sigma$ over the set of $n$ users (or, row permutation), such that $\mathsf{X}$ is $\rho$-correlated with $\mathsf{Y}^\sigma$, a permuted version of $\mathsf{Y}$. We determine sharp thresholds at which optimal testing exhibits a phase transition, depending on the asymptotic regime of $n$ and $d$. Specifically, we prove that if $\rho^2d\to0$, as $d\to\infty$, then weak detection (performing slightly better than random guessing) is statistically impossible,	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/elimelech23a	Dor Elimelech, Wasim Huleihel
Improving Graph Neural Networks with Learnable Propagation Operators	Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited in their propagation operators. In many cases, these operators often contain non-negative elements only and are shared across channels, limiting the expressiveness of GNNs. Moreover, some GNNs suffer from over-smoothing, limiting their depth. On the other hand, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can learn diverse propagation filters, and phenomena like over-smoothing are typically not apparent in CNNs. In this paper, we bridge these gaps by incorporating trainable channel-wise weighting factors $\omega$ to learn and mix multiple smoothing and sharpening propagation operators at each layer. Our generic method is called $\omega$GNN, and is easy to implement. We study two variants: $\omega$GCN and $\omega$GAT. For $\omega$GCN, we theoretically analyse its behaviour and the impact of $\omega$ on the obtained node features. Our experiments confirm these findings, demonstrating and explaining how both variants do not over-smooth. Additionally, we experiment with 15 real-world datasets on node- and graph-classification tasks, where our $\omega$GCN and $\omega$GAT perform on par with state-of-the-art methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/eliasof23b	Moshe Eliasof, Lars Ruthotto, Eran Treister
Graph Positional Encoding via Random Feature Propagation	Two main families of node feature augmentation schemes have been explored for enhancing GNNs: random features and spectral positional encoding. Surprisingly, however, there is still no clear understanding of the relation between these two augmentation schemes. Here we propose a novel family of positional encoding schemes which draws a link between the above two approaches and improves over both. The new approach, named Random Feature Propagation (RFP), is inspired by the power iteration method and its generalizations. It concatenates several intermediate steps of an iterative algorithm for computing the dominant eigenvectors of a propagation matrix, starting from random node features. Notably, these propagation steps are based on graph-dependent propagation operators that can be either predefined or learned. We explore the theoretical and empirical benefits of RFP. First, we provide theoretical justifications for using random features, for incorporating early propagation steps, and for using multiple random initializations. Then, we empirically demonstrate that RFP significantly outperforms both spectral PE and random features in multiple node classification and graph classification benchmarks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/eliasof23a	Moshe Eliasof, Fabrizio Frasca, Beatrice Bevilacqua, Eran Treister, Gal Chechik, Haggai Maron
Difference of submodular minimization via DC programming	Minimizing the difference of two submodular (DS) functions is a problem that naturally occurs in various machine learning problems. Although it is well known that a DS problem can be equivalently formulated as the minimization of the difference of two convex (DC) functions, existing algorithms do not fully exploit this connection. A classical algorithm for DC problems is called the DC algorithm (DCA). We introduce variants of DCA and its complete form (CDCA) that we apply to the DC program corresponding to DS minimization. We extend existing convergence properties of DCA, and connect them to convergence properties on the DS problem. Our results on DCA match the theoretical guarantees satisfied by existing DS algorithms, while providing a more complete characterization of convergence properties. In the case of CDCA, we obtain a stronger local minimality guarantee. Our numerical results show that our proposed algorithms outperform existing baselines on two applications: speech corpus selection and feature selection.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/el-halabi23b	Marwa El Halabi, George Orfanides, Tim Hoheisel
Fairness in Streaming Submodular Maximization over a Matroid Constraint	Streaming submodular maximization is a natural model for the task of selecting a representative subset from a large-scale dataset. If datapoints have sensitive attributes such as gender or race, it becomes important to enforce fairness to avoid bias and discrimination. This has spurred significant interest in developing fair machine learning algorithms. Recently, such algorithms have been developed for monotone submodular maximization under a cardinality constraint. In this paper, we study the natural generalization of this problem to a matroid constraint. We give streaming algorithms as well as impossibility results that provide trade-offs between efficiency, quality and fairness. We validate our findings empirically on a range of well-known real-world applications: exemplar-based clustering, movie recommendation, and maximum coverage in social networks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/el-halabi23a	Marwa El Halabi, Federico Fusco, Ashkan Norouzi-Fard, Jakab Tardos, Jakub Tarnawski
Hyperparameters in Reinforcement Learning and How To Tune Them	In order to improve reproducibility, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been adopting better scientific practices such as standardized evaluation metrics and reporting. However, the process of hyperparameter optimization still varies widely across papers, which makes it challenging to compare RL algorithms fairly. In this paper, we show that hyperparameter choices in RL can significantly affect the agent's final performance and sample efficiency, and that the hyperparameter landscape can strongly depend on the tuning seed which may lead to overfitting. We therefore propose adopting established best practices from AutoML, such as the separation of tuning and testing seeds, as well as principled hyperparameter optimization (HPO) across a broad search space. We support this by comparing multiple state-of-the-art HPO tools on a range of RL algorithms and environments to their hand-tuned counterparts, demonstrating that HPO approaches often have higher performance and lower compute overhead. As a result of our findings, we recommend a set of best practices for the RL community, which should result in stronger empirical results with fewer computational costs, better reproducibility, and thus faster progress. In order to encourage the adoption of these practices, we provide plug-and-play implementations of the tuning algorithms used in this paper at https://github.com/facebookresearch/how-to-autorl.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/eimer23a	Theresa Eimer, Marius Lindauer, Roberta Raileanu

E$(n)$ Equivariant Message Passing Simplicial Networks	This paper presents $\mathrm{E}(n)$ Equivariant Message Passing Simplicial Networks (EMPSNs), a novel approach to learning on geometric graphs and point clouds that is equivariant to rotations, translations, and reflections. EMPSNs can learn high-dimensional simplex features in graphs (e.g. triangles), and use the increase of geometric information of higher-dimensional simplices in an $\mathrm{E}(n)$ equivariant fashion. EMPSNs simultaneously generalize $\mathrm{E}(n)$ Equivariant Graph Neural Networks to a topologically more elaborate counterpart and provide an approach for including geometric information in Message Passing Simplicial Networks, thereby serving as a proof of concept for combining geometric and topological information in graph learning. The results indicate that EMPSNs can leverage the benefits of both approaches, leading to a general increase in performance when compared to either method individually, being on par with state-of-the-art approaches for learning on geometric graphs. Moreover, the results suggest that incorporating geometric information serves as an effective measure against over-smoothing in message passing networks, especially when operating on high-dimensional simplicial structures.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/eijkelboom23a	Floor Eijkelboom, Rob Hesselink, Erik J Bekkers
The Computational Complexity of Concise Hypersphere Classification	Hypersphere classification is a classical and foundational method that can provide easy-to-process explanations for the classification of real-valued as well as binary data. However, obtaining an (ideally concise) explanation via hypersphere classification is much more difficult when dealing with binary data as opposed to real-valued data. In this paper, we perform the first complexity-theoretic study of the hypersphere classification problem for binary data. We use the fine-grained parameterized complexity paradigm to analyze the impact of structural properties that may be present in the input data as well as potential conciseness constraints. Our results include not only stronger lower bounds but also a number of new fixed-parameter algorithms for hypersphere classification of binary data, which can find an exact and concise explanation when one exists.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/eiben23a	Eduard Eiben, Robert Ganian, Iyad A.

Blackout Diffusion: Generative Diffusion Models in Discrete-State Spaces	"Typical generative diffusion models rely on a Gaussian diffusion process for training the backward transformations, which can then be used to generate samples from Gaussian noise. However, real world data often takes place in discrete-state spaces, including many scientific applications. Here, we develop a theoretical formulation for arbitrary discrete-state Markov processes in the forward diffusion process using exact (as opposed to variational) analysis. We relate the theory to the existing continuous-state Gaussian diffusion as well as other approaches to discrete diffusion, and identify the corresponding reverse-time stochastic process and score function in the continuous-time setting, and the reverse-time mapping in the discrete-time setting. As an example of this framework, we introduce ""Blackout Diffusion"", which learns to produce samples from an empty image instead of from noise. Numerical experiments on the CIFAR-10, Binarized MNIST, and CelebA datasets confirm the feasibility of our approach. Generalizing from specific (Gaussian) forward processes to discrete-state processes without a variational approximation sheds light on how to interpret diffusion models, which we discuss."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/santos23a	Javier E.

FAENet: Frame Averaging Equivariant GNN for Materials Modeling	Applications of machine learning techniques for materials modeling typically involve functions that are known to be equivariant or invariant to specific symmetries. While graph neural networks (GNNs) have proven successful in such applications, conventional GNN approaches that enforce symmetries via the model architecture often reduce expressivity, scalability or comprehensibility. In this paper, we introduce (1) a flexible, model-agnostic framework based on stochastic frame averaging that enforces E(3) equivariance or invariance, without any architectural constraints; (2) FAENet: a simple, fast and expressive GNN that leverages stochastic frame averaging to process geometric information without constraints. We prove the validity of our method theoretically and demonstrate its superior accuracy and computational scalability in materials modeling on the OC20 dataset (S2EF, IS2RE) as well as common molecular modeling tasks (QM9, QM7-X).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/duval23a	Alexandre Agm Duval, Victor Schmidt, Alex Hernández-Garcı́a, Santiago Miret, Fragkiskos D.

Neural Diffusion Processes	Neural network approaches for meta-learning distributions over functions have desirable properties such as increased flexibility and a reduced complexity of inference. Building on the successes of denoising diffusion models for generative modelling, we propose Neural Diffusion Processes (NDPs), a novel approach that learns to sample from a rich distribution over functions through its finite marginals. By introducing a custom attention block we are able to incorporate properties of stochastic processes, such as exchangeability, directly into the NDP's architecture. We empirically show that NDPs can capture functional distributions close to the true Bayesian posterior, demonstrating that they can successfully emulate the behaviour of Gaussian processes and surpass the performance of neural processes. NDPs enable a variety of downstream tasks, including regression, implicit hyperparameter marginalisation, non-Gaussian posterior prediction and global optimisation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dutordoir23a	Vincent Dutordoir, Alan Saul, Zoubin Ghahramani, Fergus Simpson
Multi-Objective Population Based Training	Population Based Training (PBT) is an efficient hyperparameter optimization algorithm. PBT is a single-objective algorithm, but many real-world hyperparameter optimization problems involve two or more conflicting objectives. In this work, we therefore introduce a multi-objective version of PBT, MO-PBT. Our experiments on diverse multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problems (Precision/Recall, Accuracy/Fairness, Accuracy/Adversarial Robustness) show that MO-PBT outperforms random search, single-objective PBT, and the state-of-the-art multi-objective hyperparameter optimization algorithm MO-ASHA.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dushatskiy23a	Arkadiy Dushatskiy, Alexander Chebykin, Tanja Alderliesten, Peter Bosman
Generalization Bounds using Data-Dependent Fractal Dimensions	Providing generalization guarantees for modern neural networks has been a crucial task in statistical learning. Recently, several studies have attempted to analyze the generalization error in such settings by using tools from fractal geometry. While these works have successfully introduced new mathematical tools to apprehend generalization, they heavily rely on a Lipschitz continuity assumption, which in general does not hold for neural networks and might make the bounds vacuous. In this work, we address this issue and prove fractal geometry-based generalization bounds without requiring any Lipschitz assumption. To achieve this goal, we build up on a classical covering argument in learning theory and introduce a data-dependent fractal dimension. Despite introducing a significant amount of technical complications, this new notion lets us control the generalization error (over either fixed or random hypothesis spaces) along with certain mutual information (MI) terms. To provide a clearer interpretation to the newly introduced MI terms, as a next step, we introduce a notion of 'geometric stability' and link our bounds to the prior art. Finally, we make a rigorous connection between the proposed data-dependent dimension and topological data analysis tools, which then enables us to compute the dimension in a numerically efficient way. We support our theory with experiments conducted on various settings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dupuis23a	Benjamin Dupuis, George Deligiannidis, Umut Simsekli
Adaptive Whitening in Neural Populations with Gain-modulating Interneurons	Statistical whitening transformations play a fundamental role in many computational systems, and may also play an important role in biological sensory systems. Existing neural circuit models of adaptive whitening operate by modifying synaptic interactions; however, such modifications would seem both too slow and insufficiently reversible. Motivated by the extensive neuroscience literature on gain modulation, we propose an alternative model that adaptively whitens its responses by modulating the gains of individual neurons. Starting from a novel whitening objective, we derive an online algorithm that whitens its outputs by adjusting the marginal variances of an overcomplete set of projections. We map the algorithm onto a recurrent neural network with fixed synaptic weights and gain-modulating interneurons. We demonstrate numerically that sign-constraining the gains improves robustness of the network to ill-conditioned inputs, and a generalization of the circuit achieves a form of local whitening in convolutional populations, such as those found throughout the visual or auditory systems.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/duong23a	Lyndon Duong, David Lipshutz, David Heeger, Dmitri Chklovskii, Eero P Simoncelli
Q-Flow: Generative Modeling for Differential Equations of Open Quantum Dynamics with Normalizing Flows	Studying the dynamics of open quantum systems can enable breakthroughs both in fundamental physics and applications to quantum engineering and quantum computation. Since the density matrix $\rho$, which is the fundamental description for the dynamics of such systems, is high-dimensional, customized deep generative neural networks have been instrumental in modeling $\rho$. However, the complex-valued nature and normalization constraints of $\rho$, as well as its complicated dynamics, prohibit a seamless connection between open quantum systems and the recent advances in deep generative modeling. Here we lift that limitation by utilizing a reformulation of open quantum system dynamics to a partial differential equation (PDE) for a corresponding probability distribution $Q$, the Husimi Q function. Thus, we model the Q function seamlessly with	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dugan23a	Owen M Dugan, Peter Y. Lu, Rumen Dangovski, Di Luo, Marin Soljacic
Integrating Prior Knowledge in Contrastive Learning with Kernel	Data augmentation is a crucial component in unsupervised contrastive learning (CL). It determines how positive samples are defined and, ultimately, the quality of the learned representation. In this work, we open the door to new perspectives for CL by integrating prior knowledge, given either by generative models - viewed as prior representations - or weak attributes in the positive and negative sampling. To this end, we use kernel theory to propose a novel loss, called decoupled uniformity, that i) allows the integration of prior knowledge and ii) removes the positive-negative coupling in the original InfoNCE loss. We draw a connection between contrastive learning and the conditional mean embedding theory to derive tight bounds on the downstream classification loss. In an unsupervised setting, we empirically demonstrate that CL benefits from generative models to improve its representation both on natural and medical images. In a weakly supervised scenario, our framework outperforms other unconditional and conditional CL approaches.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dufumier23a	Benoit Dufumier, Carlo Alberto Barbano, Robin Louiset, Edouard Duchesnay, Pietro Gori
Optimal No-Regret Learning for One-Sided Lipschitz Functions	Inspired by applications in pricing and contract design, we study the maximization of one-sided Lipschitz functions, which only provide the (weaker) guarantee that they do not grow too quickly in one direction. We show that it is possible to learn a maximizer for such a function while incurring $O(\log \log T)$ total regret (with a universal constant independent of the number of discontinuities / complexity of the function). This regret bound is asymptotically optimal in $T$ due to a lower bound of Kleinberg and Leighton. By applying this algorithm, we show that one can sell digital goods to multiple buyers and learn the optimal linear contract in the principal-agent setting while incurring at most $O(\log \log T)$ regret.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/duetting23b	Paul Duetting, Guru Guruganesh, Jon Schneider, Joshua Ruizhi Wang
Fully Dynamic Submodular Maximization over Matroids	Maximizing monotone submodular functions under a matroid constraint is a classic algorithmic problem with multiple applications in data mining and machine learning. We study this classic problem in the fully dynamic setting, where elements can be both inserted and deleted in real-time. Our main result is a randomized algorithm that maintains an efficient data structure with an $\tilde{O}(k^2)$ amortized update time (in the number of additions and deletions) and yields a $4$-approximate solution, where $k$ is the rank of the matroid.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/duetting23a	Paul Duetting, Federico Fusco, Silvio Lattanzi, Ashkan Norouzi-Fard, Morteza Zadimoghaddam
Evaluating Self-Supervised Learning via Risk Decomposition	Self-supervised learning (SSL) is typically evaluated using a single metric (linear probing on ImageNet), which neither provides insight into tradeoffs between models nor highlights how to improve them. To address this, we propose an SSL risk decomposition, which generalizes the classical approximation-estimation decomposition. Our decomposition consists of four error terms: approximation, representation usability, probe generalization, and encoder generalization. We provide efficient estimators for each term and use them to analyze the effect of 30 design choices on 169 SSL vision models evaluated on ImageNet. Our analysis gives valuable insights for designing and using SSL models. For example, it highlights the main source of errors and shows how to improve SSL in specific settings (full- vs few-shot) by trading off error components.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dubois23a	Yann Dubois, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Percy Liang
Are Equivariant Equilibrium Approximators Beneficial?	Recently, remarkable progress has been made by approximating Nash equilibrium (NE), correlated equilibrium (CE), and coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE) through function approximation that trains a neural network to predict equilibria from game representations. Furthermore, equivariant architectures are widely adopted in designing such equilibrium approximators in normal-form games. In this paper, we theoretically characterize the benefits and limitations of equivariant equilibrium approximators. For the benefits, we show that they enjoy better generalizability than general ones and can achieve better approximations when the payoff distribution is permutation-invariant. For the limitations, we discuss their drawbacks in terms of equilibrium selection and social welfare. Together, our results help to understand the role of equivariance in equilibrium approximators.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/duan23d	Zhijian Duan, Yunxuan Ma, Xiaotie Deng
Bayesian Progressive Deep Topic Model with Knowledge Informed Textual Data Coarsening Process	"Deep topic models have shown an impressive ability to extract multi-layer document latent representations and discover hierarchical semantically meaningful topics.However, most deep topic models are limited to the single-step generative process, despite the fact that the progressive generative process has achieved impressive performance in modeling image data. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel progressive deep topic model that consists of a knowledge-informed textural data coarsening process and a corresponding progressive generative model. The former is used to build multi-level observations ranging from concrete to abstract, while the latter is used to generate more concrete observations gradually. Additionally, we incorporate a graph-enhanced decoder to capture the semantic relationships among words at different levels of observation. Furthermore, we perform a theoretical analysis of the proposed model based on the principle of information theory and show how it can alleviate the well-known ""latent variable collapse"" problem. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model effectively improves the ability of deep topic models, resulting in higher-quality latent document representations and topics."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/duan23c	Zhibin Duan, Xinyang Liu, Yudi Su, Yishi Xu, Bo Chen, Mingyuan Zhou
Are Diffusion Models Vulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks?	Diffusion-based generative models have shown great potential for image synthesis, but there is a lack of research on the security and privacy risks they may pose. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of diffusion models to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), a common privacy concern. Our results indicate that existing MIAs designed for GANs or VAE are largely ineffective on diffusion models, either due to inapplicable scenarios (e.g., requiring the discriminator of GANs) or inappropriate assumptions (e.g., closer distances between synthetic samples and member samples). To address this gap, we propose Step-wise Error Comparing Membership Inference (SecMI), a query-based MIA that infers memberships by assessing the matching of forward process posterior estimation at each timestep. SecMI follows the common overfitting assumption in MIA where member samples normally have smaller estimation errors, compared with hold-out samples. We consider both the standard diffusion models, e.g., DDPM, and the text-to-image diffusion models, e.g., Latent Diffusion Models and Stable Diffusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods precisely infer the membership with high confidence on both of the two scenarios across multiple different datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/jinhaoduan/SecMI.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/duan23b	Jinhao Duan, Fei Kong, Shiqi Wang, Xiaoshuang Shi, Kaidi Xu

A Flexible Diffusion Model	Denoising diffusion (score-based) generative models have become a popular choice for modeling complex data. Recently, a deep connection between forward-backward stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and diffusion-based models has been established, leading to the development of new SDE variants such as sub-VP and critically-damped Langevin. Despite the empirical success of some hand-crafted forward SDEs, many potentially promising forward SDEs remain unexplored. In this work, we propose a general framework for parameterizing diffusion models, particularly the spatial part of forward SDEs, by leveraging the symplectic and Riemannian geometry of the data manifold. We introduce a systematic formalism with theoretical guarantees and connect it with previous diffusion models. Finally, we demonstrate the theoretical advantages of our method from a variational optimization perspective. We present numerical experiments on synthetic datasets, MNIST and CIFAR10 to validate the effectiveness of our framework.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/du23g	Weitao Du, He Zhang, Tao Yang, Yuanqi Du
Guiding Pretraining in Reinforcement Learning with Large Language Models	Reinforcement learning algorithms typically struggle in the absence of a dense, well-shaped reward function. Intrinsically motivated exploration methods address this limitation by rewarding agents for visiting novel states or transitions, but these methods offer limited benefits in large environments where most discovered novelty is irrelevant for downstream tasks. We describe a method that uses background knowledge from text corpora to shape exploration. This method, called ELLM (Exploring with LLMs) rewards an agent for achieving goals suggested by a language model prompted with a description of the agent's current state. By leveraging large-scale language model pretraining, ELLM guides agents toward human-meaningful and plausibly useful behaviors without requiring a human in the loop. We evaluate ELLM in the Crafter game environment and the Housekeep robotic simulator, showing that ELLM-trained agents have better coverage of common-sense behaviors during pretraining and usually match or improve performance on a range of downstream tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/du23f	Yuqing Du, Olivia Watkins, Zihan Wang, Cédric Colas, Trevor Darrell, Pieter Abbeel, Abhishek Gupta, Jacob Andreas
On Uni-Modal Feature Learning in Supervised Multi-Modal Learning	We abstract the features (i.e. learned representations) of multi-modal data into 1) uni-modal features, which can be learned from uni-modal training, and 2) paired features, which can only be learned from cross-modal interactions. Multi-modal models are expected to benefit from cross-modal interactions on the basis of ensuring uni-modal feature learning. However, recent supervised multi-modal late-fusion training approaches still suffer from insufficient learning of uni-modal features on each modality. We prove that this phenomenon does hurt the model's generalization ability. To this end, we propose to choose a targeted late-fusion learning method for the given supervised multi-modal task from Uni-Modal Ensemble (UME) and the proposed Uni-Modal Teacher (UMT), according to the distribution of uni-modal and paired features. We demonstrate that, under a simple guiding strategy, we can achieve comparable results to other complex late-fusion or intermediate-fusion methods on various multi-modal datasets, including VGG-Sound, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and ModelNet40.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/du23e	Chenzhuang Du, Jiaye Teng, Tingle Li, Yichen Liu, Tianyuan Yuan, Yue Wang, Yang Yuan, Hang Zhao
Subsample Ridge Ensembles: Equivalences and Generalized Cross-Validation	We study subsampling-based ridge ensembles in the proportional asymptotics regime, where the feature size grows proportionally with the sample size such that their ratio converges to a constant. By analyzing the squared prediction risk of ridge ensembles as a function of the explicit penalty $\lambda$ and the limiting subsample aspect ratio $\phi_s$ (the ratio of the feature size to the subsample size), we characterize contours in the $(\lambda, \phi_s)$-plane at any achievable risk. As a consequence, we prove that the risk of the optimal full ridgeless ensemble (fitted on all possible subsamples) matches that of the optimal ridge predictor. In addition, we prove strong uniform consistency of generalized cross-validation (GCV) over the subsample sizes for estimating the prediction risk of ridge ensembles. This allows for GCV-based tuning of full ridgeless ensembles without sample splitting and yields a predictor whose risk matches optimal ridge risk.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/du23d	Jin-Hong Du, Pratik Patil, Arun K.

Nonparametric Generative Modeling with Conditional Sliced-Wasserstein Flows	Sliced-Wasserstein Flow (SWF) is a promising approach to nonparametric generative modeling but has not been widely adopted due to its suboptimal generative quality and lack of conditional modeling capabilities. In this work, we make two major contributions to bridging this gap. First, based on a pleasant observation that (under certain conditions) the SWF of joint distributions coincides with those of conditional distributions, we propose Conditional Sliced-Wasserstein Flow (CSWF), a simple yet effective extension of SWF that enables nonparametric conditional modeling. Second, we introduce appropriate inductive biases of images into SWF with two techniques inspired by local connectivity and multiscale representation in vision research, which greatly improve the efficiency and quality of modeling images. With all the improvements, we achieve generative performance comparable with many deep parametric generative models on both conditional and unconditional tasks in a purely nonparametric fashion, demonstrating its great potential.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/du23c	Chao Du, Tianbo Li, Tianyu Pang, Shuicheng Yan, Min Lin
Multi-task Representation Learning for Pure Exploration in Linear Bandits	Despite the recent success of representation learning in sequential decision making, the study of the pure exploration scenario (i.e., identify the best option and minimize the sample complexity) is still limited. In this paper, we study multi-task representation learning for best arm identification in linear bandit (RepBAI-LB) and best policy identification in contextual linear bandit (RepBPI-CLB), two popular pure exploration settings with wide applications, e.g., clinical trials and web content optimization. In these two problems, all tasks share a common low-dimensional linear representation, and our goal is to leverage this feature to accelerate the best arm (policy) identification process for all tasks. For these problems, we design computationally and sample efficient algorithms DouExpDes and C-DouExpDes, which perform double experimental designs to plan optimal sample allocations for learning the global representation. We show that by learning the common representation among tasks, our sample complexity is significantly better than that of the native approach which solves tasks independently. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the benefits of representation learning for multi-task pure exploration.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/du23b	Yihan Du, Longbo Huang, Wen Sun
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Compositional Generation with Energy-Based Diffusion Models and MCMC	Since their introduction, diffusion models have quickly become the prevailing approach to generative modeling in many domains. They can be interpreted as learning the gradients of a time-varying sequence of log-probability density functions. This interpretation has motivated classifier-based and classifier-free guidance as methods for post-hoc control of diffusion models. In this work, we build upon these ideas using the score-based interpretation of diffusion models, and explore alternative ways to condition, modify, and reuse diffusion models for tasks involving compositional generation and guidance. In particular, we investigate why certain types of composition fail using current techniques and present a number of solutions. We conclude that the sampler (not the model) is responsible for this failure and propose new samplers, inspired by MCMC, which enable successful compositional generation. Further, we propose an energy-based parameterization of diffusion models which enables the use of new compositional operators and more sophisticated, Metropolis-corrected samplers. Intriguingly we find these samplers lead to notable improvements in compositional generation across a wide variety of problems such as classifier-guided ImageNet modeling and compositional text-to-image generation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/du23a	Yilun Du, Conor Durkan, Robin Strudel, Joshua B.

PaLM-E: An Embodied Multimodal Language Model	Large language models excel at a wide range of complex tasks. However, enabling general inference in the real world, e.g. for robotics problems, raises the challenge of grounding. We propose embodied language models to directly incorporate real-world continuous sensor modalities into language models and thereby establish the link between words and percepts. Input to our embodied language model are multimodal sentences that interleave visual, continuous state estimation, and textual input encodings. We train these encodings end-to-end, in conjunction with a pre-trained large language model, for multiple embodied tasks including sequential robotic manipulation planning, visual question answering, and captioning. Our evaluations show that PaLM-E, a single large embodied multimodal model, can address a variety of embodied reasoning tasks, from a variety of observation modalities, on multiple embodiments, and further, exhibits positive transfer: the model benefits from diverse joint training across internet-scale language, vision, and visual-language domains. Our largest model with 562B parameters, in addition to being trained on robotics tasks, is a visual-language generalist with state-of-the-art performance on OK-VQA, and retains generalist language capabilities with increasing scale.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/driess23a	Danny Driess, Fei Xia, Mehdi S.

On the Convergence Rate of Gaussianization with Random Rotations	Gaussianization is a simple generative model that can be trained without backpropagation. It has shown compelling performance on low dimensional data. As the dimension increases, however, it has been observed that the convergence speed slows down. We show analytically that the number of required layers scales linearly with the dimension for Gaussian input. We argue that this is because the model is unable to capture dependencies between dimensions. Empirically, we find the same linear increase in cost for arbitrary input $p(x)$, but observe favorable scaling for some distributions. We explore potential speed-ups and formulate challenges for further research.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/draxler23a	Felix Draxler, Lars Kühmichel, Armand Rousselot, Jens Müller, Christoph Schnoerr, Ullrich Koethe
Linear Time GPs for Inferring Latent Trajectories from Neural Spike Trains	Latent Gaussian process (GP) models are widely used in neuroscience to uncover hidden state evolutions from sequential observations, mainly in neural activity recordings. While latent GP models provide a principled and powerful solution in theory, the intractable posterior in non-conjugate settings necessitates approximate inference schemes, which may lack scalability. In this work, we propose cvHM, a general inference framework for latent GP models leveraging Hida-Matérn kernels and conjugate computation variational inference (CVI). With cvHM, we are able to perform variational inference of latent neural trajectories with linear time complexity for arbitrary likelihoods. The reparameterization of stationary kernels using Hida-Matérn GPs helps us connect the latent variable models that encode prior assumptions through dynamical systems to those that encode trajectory assumptions through GPs. In contrast to previous work, we use bidirectional information filtering, leading to a more concise implementation. Furthermore, we employ the Whittle approximate likelihood to achieve highly efficient hyperparameter learning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dowling23a	Matthew Dowling, Yuan Zhao, Il Memming Park
Self-Repellent Random Walks on General Graphs Achieving Minimal Sampling Variance via Nonlinear Markov Chains	We consider random walks on discrete state spaces, such as general undirected graphs, where the random walkers are designed to approximate a target quantity over the network topology via sampling and neighborhood exploration in the form of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedures. Given any Markov chain corresponding to a target probability distribution, we design a	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/doshi23a	Vishwaraj Doshi, Jie Hu, Do Young Eun
Meta-Learning the Inductive Bias of Simple Neural Circuits	Training data is always finite, making it unclear how to generalise to unseen situations. But, animals do generalise, wielding Occam's razor to select a parsimonious explanation of their observations. How they do this is called their inductive bias, and it is implicitly built into the operation of animals' neural circuits. This relationship between an observed circuit and its inductive bias is a useful explanatory window for neuroscience, allowing design choices to be understood normatively. However, it is generally very difficult to map circuit structure to inductive bias. Here, we present a neural network tool to bridge this gap. The tool meta-learns the inductive bias by learning functions that a neural circuit finds easy to generalise, since easy-to-generalise functions are exactly those the circuit chooses to explain incomplete data. In systems with analytically known inductive bias, i.e. linear and kernel regression, our tool recovers it. Generally, we show it can flexibly extract inductive biases from supervised learners, including spiking neural networks, and show how it could be applied to real animals. Finally, we use our tool to interpret recent connectomic data illustrating our intended use: understanding the role of circuit features through the resulting inductive bias.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dorrell23a	Will Dorrell, Maria Yuffa, Peter E.

Symmetry-Aware Robot Design with Structured Subgroups	Robot design aims at learning to create robots that can be easily controlled and perform tasks efficiently. Previous works on robot design have proven its ability to generate robots for various tasks. However, these works searched the robots directly from the vast design space and ignored common structures, resulting in abnormal robots and poor performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a Symmetry-Aware Robot Design (SARD) framework that exploits the structure of the design space by incorporating symmetry searching into the robot design process. Specifically, we represent symmetries with the subgroups of the dihedral group and search for the optimal symmetry in structured subgroups. Then robots are designed under the searched symmetry. In this way, SARD can design efficient symmetric robots while covering the original design space, which is theoretically analyzed. We further empirically evaluate SARD on various tasks, and the results show its superior efficiency and generalizability.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dong23h	Heng Dong, Junyu Zhang, Tonghan Wang, Chongjie Zhang
Does Sparsity Help in Learning Misspecified Linear Bandits?	"Recently, the study of linear misspecified bandits has generated intriguing implications of the hardness of learning in bandits and reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, Du et al. (2020) shows that even if a learner is given linear features in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that approximate the rewards in a bandit or RL with a uniform error of $\varepsilon$, searching for an $O(\varepsilon)$-optimal action requires pulling at least $\Omega(\exp(d))$ queries. Furthermore, Lattimore et al. (2020) show that a degraded $O(\varepsilon\sqrt{d})$-optimal solution can be learned within $\operatorname{poly}(d/\varepsilon)$ queries. Yet it is unknown whether a structural assumption on the ground-truth parameter, such as sparsity, could break $\varepsilon\sqrt{d}$ barrier. In this paper, we address this question by showing that algorithms can obtain $O(\varepsilon)$-optimal actions by querying $\tilde{O}(\exp(m\varepsilon))$ actions, where $m$ is the sparsity parameter, removing the $\exp(d)$-dependence. We further show (with an information-theoretical lower bound) that this is the best possible if one demands an error $ m^{\delta}\varepsilon$ for $0<\delta<1$. We further show that $\operatorname{poly}(m/\varepsilon)$ bounds are possible when the linear features are ""good"". These results provide a nearly complete picture of how sparsity can help in misspecified bandit learning and provide a deeper understanding of when linear features are ""useful"" for bandit and reinforcement learning with misspecification."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dong23g	Jialin Dong, Lin Yang
Adaptively Weighted Data Augmentation Consistency Regularization for Robust Optimization under Concept Shift	"Concept shift is a prevailing problem in natural tasks like medical image segmentation where samples usually come from different subpopulations with variant correlations between features and labels. One common type of concept shift in medical image segmentation is the ""information imbalance"" between label-sparse samples with few (if any) segmentation labels and label-dense samples with plentiful labeled pixels. Existing distributionally robust algorithms have focused on adaptively truncating/down-weighting the ""less informative"" (i.e., label-sparse in our context) samples. To exploit data features of label-sparse samples more efficiently, we propose an adaptively weighted online optimization algorithm — AdaWAC — to incorporate data augmentation consistency regularization in sample reweighting. Our method introduces a set of trainable weights to balance the supervised loss and unsupervised consistency regularization of each sample separately. At the saddle point of the underlying objective, the weights assign label-dense samples to the supervised loss and label-sparse samples to the unsupervised consistency regularization. We provide a convergence guarantee by recasting the optimization as online mirror descent on a saddle point problem. Our empirical results demonstrate that AdaWAC not only enhances the segmentation performance and sample efficiency but also improves the robustness to concept shift on various medical image segmentation tasks with different UNet-style backbones."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dong23f	Yijun Dong, Yuege Xie, Rachel Ward
PASTA: Pessimistic Assortment Optimization	We consider a fundamental class of assortment optimization problems in an offline data-driven setting. The firm does not know the underlying customer choice model but has access to an offline dataset consisting of the historically offered assortment set, customer choice, and revenue. The objective is to use the offline dataset to find an optimal assortment. Due to the combinatorial nature of assortment optimization, the problem of insufficient data coverage is likely to occur in the offline dataset. Therefore, designing a provably efficient offline learning algorithm becomes a significant challenge. To this end, based on the principle of pessimism, we propose a novel algorithm called Pessimistic ASsortment opTimizAtion (PASTA for short), which can correctly identify the optimal assortment by only requiring the offline data to cover the optimal assortment under general settings. In particular, we establish the first regret bound for the offline assortment optimization problem under the celebrated multinomial logit model (MNL). We also propose an efficient computational procedure to solve our pessimistic assortment optimization problem. Our numerical studies demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the existing baseline method.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dong23e	Juncheng Dong, Weibin Mo, Zhengling Qi, Cong Shi, Ethan X Fang, Vahid Tarokh
Diversity-enhancing Generative Network for Few-shot Hypothesis Adaptation	Generating unlabeled data has been recently shown to help address the few-shot hypothesis adaptation (FHA) problem, where we aim to train a classifier for the target domain with a few labeled target-domain data and a well-trained source-domain classifier (i.e., a source hypothesis), for the additional information of the highly-compatible unlabeled data. However, the generated data of the existing methods are extremely similar or even the same. The strong dependency among the generated data will lead the learning to fail. In this paper, we propose a diversity-enhancing generative network (DEG-Net) for the FHA problem, which can generate diverse unlabeled data with the help of a kernel independence measure: the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). Specifically, DEG-Net will generate data via minimizing the HSIC value (i.e., maximizing the independence) among the semantic features of the generated data. By DEG-Net, the generated unlabeled data are more diverse and more effective for addressing the FHA problem. Experimental results show that the DEG-Net outperforms existing FHA baselines and further verifies that generating diverse data plays an important role in addressing the FHA problem.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dong23d	Ruijiang Dong, Feng Liu, Haoang Chi, Tongliang Liu, Mingming Gong, Gang Niu, Masashi Sugiyama, Bo Han

SpeedDETR: Speed-aware Transformers for End-to-end Object Detection	Vision Transformers (ViTs) have continuously achieved new milestones in object detection. However, the considerable computation and memory burden compromise their efficiency and generalization of deployment on resource-constraint devices. Besides, efficient transformer-based detectors designed by existing works can hardly achieve a realistic speedup, especially on multi-core processors (e.g., GPUs). The main issue is that the current literature solely concentrates on building algorithms with minimal computation, oblivious that the practical latency can also be affected by the memory access cost and the degree of parallelism. Therefore, we propose SpeedDETR, a novel speed-aware transformer for end-to-end object detectors, achieving high-speed inference on multiple devices. Specifically, we design a latency prediction model which can directly and accurately estimate the network latency by analyzing network properties, hardware memory access pattern, and degree of parallelism. Following the effective local-to-global visual modeling process and the guidance of the latency prediction model, we build our hardware-oriented architecture design and develop a new family of SpeedDETR. Experiments on the MS COCO dataset show SpeedDETR outperforms current DETR-based methods on Tesla V100. Even acceptable speed inference can be achieved on edge GPUs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dong23b	Peiyan Dong, Zhenglun Kong, Xin Meng, Peng Zhang, Hao Tang, Yanzhi Wang, Chih-Hsien Chou
Towards Understanding and Reducing Graph Structural Noise for GNNs	Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm to learn from relational data mostly through applying the message passing mechanism. However, this approach may exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to graphs possessing various structural issues. In this work, we focus on understanding and alleviating the effect of graph structural noise on GNN performance. To evaluate the graph structural noise in real data, we propose edge signal-to-noise ratio (ESNR), a novel metric evaluating overall edge noise level with respect to data features or labels based on random matrix theory. We have found striking concordance between the proposed ESNR metric and the GNN performance in various simulated and real data. To reduce the effect of the noise, we propose GPS (Graph Propensity Score) graph rewiring, which estimates the edge likelihood for rewiring data graphs based on self-supervised link prediction. We provide a theoretical guarantee for GPS graph rewiring and demonstrate its efficacy by comprehensive benchmarks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dong23a	Mingze Dong, Yuval Kluger
On Data Manifolds Entailed by Structural Causal Models	The geometric structure of data is an important inductive bias in machine learning. In this work, we characterize the data manifolds entailed by structural causal models. The strengths of the proposed framework are twofold: firstly, the geometric structure of the data manifolds is causally informed, and secondly, it enables causal reasoning about the data manifolds in an interventional and a counterfactual sense. We showcase the versatility of the proposed framework by applying it to the generation of causally-grounded counterfactual explanations for machine learning classifiers, measuring distances along the data manifold in a differential geometric-principled manner.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dominguez-olmedo23a	Ricardo Dominguez-Olmedo, Amir-Hossein Karimi, Georgios Arvanitidis, Bernhard Schölkopf
Polynomial Preconditioning for Gradient Methods	We study first-order methods with preconditioning for solving structured convex optimization problems. We propose a new family of preconditioners generated by the symmetric polynomials. They provide the first-order optimization methods with a provable improvement of the condition number, cutting the gaps between highest eigenvalues, without explicit knowledge of the actual spectrum. We give a stochastic interpretation of this preconditioning in terms of the coordinate volume sampling and compare it with other classical approaches, including the Chebyshev polynomials. We show how to incorporate a polynomial preconditioning into the Gradient and Fast Gradient Methods and establish their better global complexity bounds. Finally, we propose a simple adaptive search procedure that automatically ensures the best polynomial preconditioning for the Gradient Method, minimizing the objective along a low-dimensional Krylov subspace. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of our preconditioning strategies for solving various machine learning problems.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/doikov23b	Nikita Doikov, Anton Rodomanov
Second-Order Optimization with Lazy Hessians	We analyze Newton's method with lazy Hessian updates for solving general possibly non-convex optimization problems. We propose to reuse a previously seen Hessian for several iterations while computing new gradients at each step of the method. This significantly reduces the overall arithmetic complexity of second-order optimization schemes. By using the cubic regularization technique, we establish fast global convergence of our method to a second-order stationary point, while the Hessian does not need to be updated each iteration. For convex problems, we justify global and local superlinear rates for lazy Newton steps with quadratic regularization, which is easier to compute. The optimal frequency for updating the Hessian is once every $d$ iterations, where $d$ is the dimension of the problem. This provably improves the total arithmetic complexity of second-order algorithms by a factor $\sqrt{d}$.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/doikov23a	Nikita Doikov, El Mahdi Chayti, Martin Jaggi
PixelAsParam: A Gradient View on Diffusion Sampling with Guidance	Diffusion models recently achieved state-of-the-art in image generation. They mainly utilize the denoising framework, which leverages the Langevin dynamics process for image sampling. Recently, the guidance method has modified this process to add conditional information to achieve a controllable generator. However, the current guidance on denoising processes suffers from the trade-off between diversity, image quality, and conditional information. In this work, we propose to view this guidance sampling process from a gradient view, where image pixels are treated as parameters being optimized, and each mathematical term in the sampling process represents one update direction. This perspective reveals more insights into the conflict problems between updated directions on the pixels, which cause the trade-off as mentioned previously. We investigate the conflict problems and propose to solve them by a simple projection method. The experimental results evidently improve over different baselines on datasets with various resolutions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dinh23a	Anh-Dung Dinh, Daochang Liu, Chang Xu
Entity Divider with Language Grounding in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning	We investigate the use of natural language to drive the generalization of policies in multi-agent settings. Unlike single-agent settings, the generalization of policies should also consider the influence of other agents. Besides, with the increasing number of entities in multi-agent settings, more agent-entity interactions are needed for language grounding, and the enormous search space could impede the learning process. Moreover, given a simple general instruction, e.g., beating all enemies, agents are required to decompose it into multiple subgoals and figure out the right one to focus on. Inspired by previous work, we try to address these issues at the entity level and propose a novel framework for language grounding in multi-agent reinforcement learning, entity divider (EnDi). EnDi enables agents to independently learn subgoal division at the entity level and act in the environment based on the associated entities. The subgoal division is regularized by agent modeling to avoid subgoal conflicts and promote coordinated strategies. Empirically, EnDi demonstrates the strong generalization ability to unseen games with new dynamics and expresses the superiority over existing methods. The code is available at https://github.com/PKU-RL/EnDi.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ding23d	Ziluo Ding, Wanpeng Zhang, Junpeng Yue, Xiangjun Wang, Tiejun Huang, Zongqing Lu
Open-Vocabulary Universal Image Segmentation with MaskCLIP	In this paper, we tackle an emerging computer vision task, open-vocabulary universal image segmentation, that aims to perform semantic/instance/panoptic segmentation (background semantic labeling + foreground instance segmentation) for arbitrary categories of text-based descriptions in inference time. We first build a baseline method by directly adopting pre-trained CLIP models without finetuning or distillation. We then develop MaskCLIP, a Transformer-based approach with a MaskCLIP Visual Encoder, which is an encoder-only module that seamlessly integrates mask tokens with a pre-trained ViT CLIP model for semantic/instance segmentation and class prediction. MaskCLIP learns to efficiently and effectively utilize pre-trained partial/dense CLIP features within the MaskCLIP Visual Encoder that avoids the time-consuming student-teacher training process. MaskCLIP outperforms previous methods for semantic/instance/panoptic segmentation on ADE20K and PASCAL datasets. We show qualitative illustrations for MaskCLIP with online custom categories.

DSGD-CECA: Decentralized SGD with Communication-Optimal Exact Consensus Algorithm	Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an emerging neural network training approach that enables multiple agents to train a model collaboratively and simultaneously. Rather than using a central parameter server to collect gradients from all the agents, each agent keeps a copy of the model parameters and communicates with a small number of other agents to exchange model updates. Their communication, governed by the communication topology and gossip weight matrices, facilitates the exchange of model updates. The state-of-the-art approach uses the dynamic one-peer exponential-2 topology, achieving faster training times and improved scalability than the ring, grid, torus, and hypercube topologies. However, this approach requires a power-of-2 number of agents, which is impractical at scale. In this paper, we remove this restriction and propose Decentralized SGD with Communication-optimal Exact Consensus Algorithm (DSGD-CECA), which works for any number of agents while still achieving state-of-the-art properties. In particular, DSGD-CECA incurs a unit per-iteration communication overhead and an $\tilde{O}(n^3)$ transient iteration complexity. Our proof is based on newly discovered properties of gossip weight matrices and a novel approach to combine them with DSGD's convergence analysis. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of DSGD-CECA.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ding23b	Lisang Ding, Kexin Jin, Bicheng Ying, Kun Yuan, Wotao Yin
Bayesian Reparameterization of Reward-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Energy-based Models	"Recently, reward-conditioned reinforcement learning (RCRL) has gained popularity due to its simplicity, flexibility, and off-policy nature. However, we will show that current RCRL approaches are fundamentally limited and fail to address two critical challenges of RCRL – improving generalization on high reward-to-go (RTG) inputs, and avoiding out-of-distribution (OOD) RTG queries during testing time. To address these challenges when training vanilla RCRL architectures, we propose Bayesian Reparameterized RCRL (BR-RCRL), a novel set of inductive biases for RCRL inspired by Bayes' theorem. BR-RCRL removes a core obstacle preventing vanilla RCRL from generalizing on high RTG inputs – a tendency that the model treats different RTG inputs as independent values, which we term ""RTG Independence"". BR-RCRL also allows us to design an accompanying adaptive inference method, which maximizes total returns while avoiding OOD queries that yield unpredictable behaviors in vanilla RCRL methods. We show that BR-RCRL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Gym-Mujoco and Atari offline RL benchmarks, improving upon vanilla RCRL by up to 11%."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ding23a	Wenhao Ding, Tong Che, Ding Zhao, Marco Pavone
Pareto Manifold Learning: Tackling multiple tasks via ensembles of single-task models	In Multi-Task Learning (MTL), tasks may compete and limit the performance achieved on each other, rather than guiding the optimization to a solution, superior to all its single-task trained counterparts. Since there is often not a unique solution optimal for all tasks, practitioners have to balance tradeoffs between tasks' performance, and resort to optimality in the Pareto sense. Most MTL methodologies either completely neglect this aspect, and instead of aiming at learning a Pareto Front, produce one solution predefined by their optimization schemes, or produce diverse but discrete solutions. Recent approaches parameterize the Pareto Front via neural networks, leading to complex mappings from tradeoff to objective space. In this paper, we conjecture that the Pareto Front admits a linear parameterization in parameter space, which leads us to propose	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dimitriadis23a	Nikolaos Dimitriadis, Pascal Frossard, François Fleuret
Subset-Based Instance Optimality in Private Estimation	We propose a new definition of instance optimality for differentially private estimation algorithms. Our definition requires an optimal algorithm to compete, simultaneously for every dataset $D$, with the best private benchmark algorithm that (a) knows $D$ in advance and (b) is evaluated by its worst-case performance on large subsets of $D$. That is, the benchmark algorithm need not perform well when potentially extreme points are added to $D$; it only has to handle the removal of a small number of real data points that already exist. This makes our benchmark significantly stronger than those proposed in prior work. We nevertheless show, for real-valued datasets, how to construct private algorithms that achieve our notion of instance optimality when estimating a broad class of dataset properties, including means, quantiles, and $\ell_p$-norm minimizers. For means in particular, we provide a detailed analysis and show that our algorithm simultaneously matches or exceeds the asymptotic performance of existing algorithms under a range of distributional assumptions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dick23a	Travis Dick, Alex Kulesza, Ziteng Sun, Ananda Theertha Suresh
Forward-Backward Gaussian Variational Inference via JKO in the Bures-Wasserstein Space	Variational inference (VI) seeks to approximate a target distribution $\pi$ by an element of a tractable family of distributions. Of key interest in statistics and machine learning is Gaussian VI, which approximates $\pi$ by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to $\pi$ over the space of Gaussians. In this work, we develop the (Stochastic) Forward-Backward Gaussian Variational Inference (FB-GVI) algorithm to solve Gaussian VI. Our approach exploits the composite structure of the KL divergence, which can be written as the sum of a smooth term (the potential) and a non-smooth term (the entropy) over the Bures-Wasserstein (BW) space of Gaussians endowed with the Wasserstein distance. For our proposed algorithm, we obtain state-of-the-art convergence guarantees when $\pi$ is log-smooth and log-concave, as well as the first convergence guarantees to first-order stationary solutions when $\pi$ is only log-smooth.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/diao23a	Michael Ziyang Diao, Krishna Balasubramanian, Sinho Chewi, Adil Salim
Improving Graph Generation by Restricting Graph Bandwidth	Deep graph generative modeling has proven capable of learning the distribution of complex, multi-scale structures characterizing real-world graphs. However, one of the main limitations of existing methods is their large output space, which limits generation scalability and hinders accurate modeling of the underlying distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach that significantly reduces the output space of existing graph generative models. Specifically, starting from the observation that many real-world graphs have low graph bandwidth, we restrict graph bandwidth during training and generation. Our strategy improves both generation scalability and quality without increasing architectural complexity or reducing expressiveness. Our approach is compatible with existing graph generative methods, and we describe its application to both autoregressive and one-shot models. We extensively validate our strategy on synthetic and real datasets, including molecular graphs. Our experiments show that, in addition to improving generation efficiency, our approach consistently improves generation quality and reconstruction accuracy. The implementation is made available.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/diamant23a	Nathaniel Lee Diamant, Alex M Tseng, Kangway V. Chuang, Tommaso Biancalani, Gabriele Scalia
Near-Optimal Cryptographic Hardness of Agnostically Learning Halfspaces and ReLU Regression under Gaussian Marginals	We study the task of agnostically learning halfspaces under the Gaussian distribution. Specifically, given labeled examples $(\\mathbf{x},y)$ from an unknown distribution on $\\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\{\pm 1 \\}$, whose marginal distribution on $\\mathbf{x}$ is the standard Gaussian and the labels $y$ can be arbitrary, the goal is to output a hypothesis with 0-1 loss $\\mathrm{OPT}+\\epsilon$, where $\\mathrm{OPT}$ is the 0-1 loss of the best-fitting halfspace. We prove a near-optimal computational hardness result for this task, under the widely believed sub-exponential time hardness of the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem. Prior hardness results are either qualitatively suboptimal or apply to restricted families of algorithms. Our techniques extend to yield near-optimal lower bounds for related problems, including ReLU regression.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/diakonikolas23b	Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel Kane, Lisheng Ren
Nearly-Linear Time and Streaming Algorithms for Outlier-Robust PCA	We study principal component analysis (PCA), where given a dataset in $\mathbb R^d$ from a distribution, the task is to find a unit vector $v$ that approximately maximizes the variance of the distribution after being projected along $v$. Despite being a classical task, standard estimators fail drastically if the data contains even a small fraction of outliers, motivating the problem of robust PCA. Recent work has developed computationally-efficient algorithms for robust PCA that either take super-linear time or have sub-optimal error guarantees. Our main contribution is to develop a nearly linear time algorithm for robust PCA with near-optimal error guarantees. We also develop a single-pass streaming algorithm for robust PCA with memory usage nearly-linear in the dimension.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/diakonikolas23a	Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel Kane, Ankit Pensia, Thanasis Pittas
On Over-Squashing in Message Passing Neural Networks: The Impact of Width, Depth, and Topology	Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are instances of Graph Neural Networks that leverage the graph to send messages over the edges. This inductive bias leads to a phenomenon known as over-squashing, where a node feature is insensitive to information contained at distant nodes. Despite recent methods introduced to mitigate this issue, an understanding of the causes for over-squashing and of possible solutions are lacking. In this theoretical work, we prove that: (i) Neural network width can mitigate over-squashing, but at the cost of making the whole network more sensitive; (ii) Conversely, depth cannot help mitigate over-squashing: increasing the number of layers leads to over-squashing being dominated by vanishing gradients; (iii) The graph topology plays the greatest role, since over-squashing occurs between nodes at high commute time. Our analysis provides a unified framework to study different recent methods introduced to cope with over-squashing and serves as a justification for a class of methods that fall under graph rewiring.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/di-giovanni23a	Francesco Di Giovanni, Lorenzo Giusti, Federico Barbero, Giulia Luise, Pietro Lio, Michael M.

Nearly Minimax Optimal Regret for Learning Linear Mixture Stochastic Shortest Path	We study the Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem with a linear mixture transition kernel, where an agent repeatedly interacts with a stochastic environment and seeks to reach certain goal state while minimizing the cumulative cost. Existing works often assume a strictly positive lower bound of the cost function or an upper bound of the expected length for the optimal policy. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to eliminate these restrictive assumptions. Our algorithm is based on extended value iteration with a fine-grained variance-aware confidence set, where the variance is estimated recursively from high-order moments. Our algorithm achieves an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(dB_*\sqrt{K})$ regret bound, where $d$ is the dimension of the feature mapping in the linear transition kernel, $B_*$ is the upper bound of the total cumulative cost for the optimal policy, and $K$ is the number of episodes. Our regret upper bound matches the $\Omega(dB_*\sqrt{K})$ lower bound of linear mixture SSPs in Min et al. (2022), which suggests that our algorithm is nearly minimax optimal.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/di23a	Qiwei Di, Jiafan He, Dongruo Zhou, Quanquan Gu
A Large-Scale Study of Probabilistic Calibration in Neural Network Regression	Accurate probabilistic predictions are essential for optimal decision making. While neural network miscalibration has been studied primarily in classification, we investigate this in the less-explored domain of regression. We conduct the largest empirical study to date to assess the probabilistic calibration of neural networks. We also analyze the performance of recalibration, conformal, and regularization methods to enhance probabilistic calibration. Additionally, we introduce novel differentiable recalibration and regularization methods, uncovering new insights into their effectiveness. Our findings reveal that regularization methods offer a favorable tradeoff between calibration and sharpness. Post-hoc methods exhibit superior probabilistic calibration, which we attribute to the finite-sample coverage guarantee of conformal prediction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that quantile recalibration can be considered as a specific case of conformal prediction. Our study is fully reproducible and implemented in a common code base for fair comparisons.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dheur23a	Victor Dheur, Souhaib Ben Taieb
Efficient Parametric Approximations of Neural Network Function Space Distance	It is often useful to compactly summarize important properties of model parameters and training data so that they can be used later without storing and/or iterating over the entire dataset. As a specific case, we consider estimating the Function Space Distance (FSD) over a training set, i.e. the average discrepancy between the outputs of two neural networks. We propose a Linearized Activation Function TRick (LAFTR) and derive an efficient approximation to FSD for ReLU neural networks. The key idea is to approximate the architecture as a linear network with stochastic gating. Despite requiring only one parameter per unit of the network, our approach outcompetes other parametric approximations with larger memory requirements. Applied to continual learning, our parametric approximation is competitive with state-of-the-art nonparametric approximations, which require storing many training examples. Furthermore, we show its efficacy in estimating influence functions accurately and detecting mislabeled examples without expensive iterations over the entire dataset.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dhawan23a	Nikita Dhawan, Sicong Huang, Juhan Bae, Roger Baker Grosse
Fairness in Matching under Uncertainty	The prevalence and importance of algorithmic two-sided marketplaces has drawn attention to the issue of fairness in such settings. Algorithmic decisions are used in assigning students to schools, users to advertisers, and applicants to job interviews. These decisions should heed the preferences of individuals, and simultaneously be fair with respect to their merits (synonymous with fit, future performance, or need). Merits conditioned on observable features are always	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/devic23a	Siddartha Devic, David Kempe, Vatsal Sharan, Aleksandra Korolova
The case for 4-bit precision: k-bit Inference Scaling Laws	Quantization methods reduce the number of bits required to represent each parameter in a model, trading accuracy for smaller memory footprints and inference latencies. However, the final model size depends on both the number of parameters of the original model and the rate of compression. For example, a 30B 8-bit model and a 60B 4-bit model have the same number of bits but may have very different zero-shot accuracies. In this work, we study this trade-off by developing inference scaling laws of zero-shot performance in Large Language Models (LLMs) to determine the bit-precision and model size that maximizes zero-shot performance. We run more than 35,000 experiments with 16-bit inputs and k-bit parameters to examine which zero-shot quantization methods improve scaling for 3 to 8-bit precision at scales of 19M to 176B parameters across the LLM families BLOOM, OPT, NeoX/Pythia, and GPT-2. We find that it is challenging to improve the bit-level scaling trade-off, with the only improvements being the use of a small block size – splitting the parameters into small independently quantized blocks – and the quantization data type being used (e.g., Int vs Float). Overall, our findings show that 4-bit precision is almost universally optimal for total model bits and zero-shot accuracy.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dettmers23a	Tim Dettmers, Luke Zettlemoyer
Hardware-Aware Compression with Random Operation Access Specific Tile (ROAST) Hashing	Advancements in deep learning are often associated with increasing model sizes. Training and deploying large models require sophisticated hardware and incur significantly higher costs. Thus, model compression is a widely explored approach to solving the problem. However, SOTA techniques fall short in one or more desirable aspects of compression - for instance, pruning does not reduce memory for training, quantization can only provide up to 32$\times$ compression, HashedNet is cache-inefficient, etc. This paper proposes a model-agnostic, cache-friendly, and hardware-aware model compression approach: Random Operation Access Specific Tile (ROAST) hashing. ROAST collapses the parameters by clubbing them through a lightweight mapping. While clubbing these parameters, ROAST utilizes cache hierarchies by aligning the memory access pattern with the parameter access pattern. ROAST is up to ${\sim}25\times$ faster to train and ${\sim}50\times$ faster to infer than the popular parameter sharing method HashedNet. Additionally, ROAST introduces global weight sharing, which is empirically and theoretically superior to local weight sharing in HashedNet, and can be of independent interest. With ROAST, we can efficiently train and deploy the model using a much smaller memory footprint ($\sim 10 - 100\times$ lesser) in text and image classification tasks. ROAST-MM kernel implementation is open-source (https://github.com/apd10/RzLinear/tree/stable)	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/desai23b	Aditya Desai, Keren Zhou, Anshumali Shrivastava
Hyperbolic Image-text Representations	"Visual and linguistic concepts naturally organize themselves in a hierarchy, where a textual concept ""dog"" entails all images that contain dogs. Despite being intuitive, current large-scale vision and language models such as CLIP do not explicitly capture such hierarchy. We propose MERU, a contrastive model that yields hyperbolic representations of images and text. Hyperbolic spaces have suitable geometric properties to embed tree-like data, so MERU can better capture the underlying hierarchy in image-text datasets. Our results show that MERU learns a highly interpretable and structured representation space while being competitive with CLIP's performance on standard multi-modal tasks like image classification and image-text retrieval."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/desai23a	Karan Desai, Maximilian Nickel, Tanmay Rajpurohit, Justin Johnson, Shanmukha Ramakrishna Vedantam
Great Models Think Alike: Improving Model Reliability via Inter-Model Latent Agreement	Reliable application of machine learning is of primary importance to the practical deployment of deep learning methods. A fundamental challenge is that models are often unreliable due to overconfidence. In this paper, we estimate a model's reliability by measuring the agreement between its latent space, and the latent space of a foundation model. However, it is challenging to measure the agreement between two different latent spaces due to their incoherence, e.g., arbitrary rotations and different dimensionality. To overcome this incoherence issue, we design a neighborhood agreement measure between latent spaces and find that this agreement is surprisingly well-correlated with the reliability of a model's predictions. Further, we show that fusing neighborhood agreement into a model's predictive confidence in a post-hoc way significantly improves its reliability. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on failure detection across various datasets verify the effectiveness of our method on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/deng23f	Ailin Deng, Miao Xiong, Bryan Hooi
Confidence and Dispersity Speak: Characterizing Prediction Matrix for Unsupervised Accuracy Estimation	This work aims to assess how well a model performs under distribution shifts without using labels. While recent methods study prediction confidence, this work reports prediction dispersity is another informative cue. Confidence reflects whether the individual prediction is certain; dispersity indicates how the overall predictions are distributed across all categories. Our key insight is that a well-performing model should give predictions with high confidence and high dispersity. That is, we need to consider both properties so as to make more accurate estimates. To this end, we use nuclear norm that has been shown to be effective in characterizing both properties. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of nuclear norm for various models (e.g., ViT and ConvNeXt), different datasets (e.g., ImageNet and CUB-200), and diverse types of distribution shifts (e.g., style shift and reproduction shift). We show that nuclear norm is more accurate and robust in accuracy estimation than existing methods. Furthermore, we validate the feasibility of other measurements (e.g., mutual information maximization) for characterizing dispersity and confidence. Lastly, we investigate the limitation of the nuclear norm, study its improved variant under severe class imbalance, and discuss potential directions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/deng23e	Weijian Deng, Yumin Suh, Stephen Gould, Liang Zheng
Surrogate Module Learning: Reduce the Gradient Error Accumulation in Training Spiking Neural Networks	Spiking neural networks provide an alternative solution to conventional artificial neural networks with energy-saving and high-efficiency characteristics after hardware implantation. However, due to its non-differentiable activation function and the temporally delayed accumulation in outputs, the direct training of SNNs is extraordinarily tough even adopting a surrogate gradient to mimic the backpropagation. For SNN training, this non-differentiability causes the intrinsic gradient error that would be magnified through layerwise backpropagation, especially through multiple layers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to reducing gradient error from a new perspective called surrogate module learning (SML). Surrogate module learning tries to construct a shortcut path to back-propagate more accurate gradient to a certain SNN part utilizing the surrogate modules. Then, we develop a new loss function for concurrently training the network and enhancing the surrogate modules' surrogate capacity. We demonstrate that when the outputs of surrogate modules are close to the SNN output, the fraction of the gradient error drops significantly. Our method consistently and significantly enhances the performance of SNNs on all experiment datasets, including CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, and ES-ImageNet. For example, for spiking ResNet-34 architecture on ImageNet, we increased the SNN accuracy by 3.46%.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/deng23d	Shikuang Deng, Hao Lin, Yuhang Li, Shi Gu
Multi-channel Autobidding with Budget and ROI Constraints	In digital online advertising, advertisers procure ad impressions simultaneously on multiple platforms, or so-called channels, such as Google Ads, Meta Ads Manager, etc., each of which consists of numerous ad auctions. We study how an advertiser maximizes total conversion (e.g. ad clicks) while satisfying aggregate return-on-investment (ROI) and budget constraints across all channels. In practice, an advertiser does not have control over, and thus cannot globally optimize, which individual ad auctions she participates in for each channel, and instead authorizes a channel to procure impressions on her behalf: the advertiser can only utilize two levers on each channel, namely setting a per-channel budget and per-channel target ROI. In this work, we first analyze the effectiveness of each of these levers for solving the advertiser's global multi-channel problem. We show that when an advertiser only optimizes over per-channel ROIs, her total conversion can be arbitrarily worse than what she could have obtained in the global problem. Further, we show that the advertiser can achieve the global optimal conversion when she only optimizes over per-channel budgets. In light of this finding, under a bandit feedback setting that mimics real-world scenarios where advertisers have limited information on ad auctions in each channels and how channels procure ads, we present an efficient learning algorithm that produces per-channel budgets whose resulting conversion approximates that of the global optimal problem.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/deng23c	Yuan Deng, Negin Golrezaei, Patrick Jaillet, Jason Cheuk Nam Liang, Vahab Mirrokni
Uncertainty Estimation by Fisher Information-based Evidential Deep Learning	Uncertainty estimation is a key factor that makes deep learning reliable in practical applications. Recently proposed evidential neural networks explicitly account for different uncertainties by treating the network's outputs as evidence to parameterize the Dirichlet distribution, and achieve impressive performance in uncertainty estimation. However, for high data uncertainty samples but annotated with the one-hot label, the evidence-learning process for those mislabeled classes is over-penalized and remains hindered. To address this problem, we propose a novel method, Fisher Information-based Evidential Deep Learning ($\mathcal{I}$-EDL). In particular, we introduce Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to measure the informativeness of evidence carried by each sample, according to which we can dynamically reweight the objective loss terms to make the network more focus on the representation learning of uncertain classes. The generalization ability of our network is further improved by optimizing the PAC-Bayesian bound. As demonstrated empirically, our proposed method consistently outperforms traditional EDL-related algorithms in multiple uncertainty estimation tasks, especially in the more challenging few-shot classification settings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/deng23b	Danruo Deng, Guangyong Chen, Yang Yu, Furui Liu, Pheng-Ann Heng
Optimizing NOTEARS Objectives via Topological Swaps	Recently, an intriguing class of non-convex optimization problems has emerged in the context of learning directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). These problems involve minimizing a given loss or score function, subject to a non-convex continuous constraint that penalizes the presence of cycles in a graph. In this work, we delve into the optimality challenges associated with this class of non-convex programs. To address these challenges, we propose a bi-level algorithm that leverages the non-convex constraint in a novel way. The outer level of the algorithm optimizes over topological orders by iteratively swapping pairs of nodes within the topological order of a DAG. A key innovation of our approach is the development of an effective method for generating a set of candidate swapping pairs for each iteration. At the inner level, given a topological order, we utilize off-the-shelf solvers that can handle linear constraints. The key advantage of our proposed algorithm is that it is guaranteed to find a local minimum or a KKT point under weaker conditions compared to previous work and finds solutions with lower scores. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of achieving a better score. Additionally, our method can also be used as a post-processing algorithm to significantly improve the score of other algorithms. Code implementing the proposed method is available at https://github.com/duntrain/topo.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/deng23a	Chang Deng, Kevin Bello, Bryon Aragam, Pradeep Kumar Ravikumar
Blossom: an Anytime Algorithm for Computing Optimal Decision Trees	We propose a simple algorithm to learn optimal decision trees of bounded depth. This algorithm is essentially an anytime version of the state-of-the-art dynamic programming approach. It has virtually no overhead compared to heuristic methods and is comparable to the best exact methods to prove optimality on most data sets. Experiments show that whereas existing exact methods hardly scale to deep trees, this algorithm learns trees comparable to standard heuristics without computational overhead, and can significantly improve their accuracy when given more computation time, even for deep trees.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/demirovic23a	Emir Demirović, Emmanuel Hebrard, Louis Jean
Efficient Bound of Lipschitz Constant for Convolutional Layers by Gram Iteration	Since the control of the Lipschitz constant has a great impact on the training stability, generalization, and robustness of neural networks, the estimation of this value is nowadays a real scientific challenge. In this paper we introduce a precise, fast, and differentiable upper bound for the spectral norm of convolutional layers using circulant matrix theory and a new alternative to the Power iteration. Called the Gram iteration, our approach exhibits a superlinear convergence. First, we show through a comprehensive set of experiments that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, computational cost, and scalability. Then, it proves highly effective for the Lipschitz regularization of convolutional neural networks, with competitive results against concurrent approaches.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/delattre23a	Blaise Delattre, Quentin Barthélemy, Alexandre Araujo, Alexandre Allauzen
Scaling Vision Transformers to 22 Billion Parameters	"The scaling of Transformers has driven breakthrough capabilities for language models. At present, the largest large language models (LLMs) contain upwards of 100B parameters. Vision Transformers (ViT) have introduced the same architecture to image and video modelling, but these have not yet been successfully scaled to nearly the same degree; the largest dense ViT contains 4B parameters (Chen et al., 2022). We present a recipe for highly efficient and stable training of a 22B-parameter ViT (ViT-22B) and perform a wide variety of experiments on the resulting model. When evaluated on downstream tasks (often with a lightweight linear model on frozen features), ViT-22B demonstrates increasing performance with scale. We further observe other interesting benefits of scale, including an improved tradeoff between fairness and performance, state-of-the-art alignment to human visual perception in terms of shape/texture bias, and improved robustness. ViT-22B demonstrates the potential for ""LLM-like"" scaling in vision, and provides key steps towards getting there."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dehghani23a	Mostafa Dehghani, Josip Djolonga, Basil Mustafa, Piotr Padlewski, Jonathan Heek, Justin Gilmer, Andreas Peter Steiner, Mathilde Caron, Robert Geirhos, Ibrahim Alabdulmohsin, Rodolphe Jenatton, Lucas Beyer, Michael Tschannen, Anurag Arnab, Xiao Wang, Carlos Riquelme Ruiz, Matthias Minderer, Joan Puigcerver, Utku Evci, Manoj Kumar, Sjoerd Van Steenkiste, Gamaleldin Fathy Elsayed, Aravindh Mahendran, Fisher Yu, Avital Oliver, Fantine Huot, Jasmijn Bastings, Mark Collier, Alexey A.

Learning-Rate-Free Learning by D-Adaptation	The speed of gradient descent for convex Lipschitz functions is highly dependent on the choice of learning rate. Setting the learning rate to achieve the optimal convergence rate requires knowing the distance D from the initial point to the solution set. In this work, we describe a single-loop method, with no back-tracking or line searches, which does not require knowledge of D yet asymptotically achieves the optimal rate of convergence for the complexity class of convex Lipschitz functions. Our approach is the first parameter-free method for this class without additional multiplicative log factors in the convergence rate. We present extensive experiments for SGD and Adam variants of our method, where the method automatically matches hand-tuned learning rates across more than a dozen diverse machine learning problems, including large-scale vision and language problems. Our method is practical, efficient and requires no additional function value or gradient evaluations each step. An implementation is provided in the supplementary material.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/defazio23a	Aaron Defazio, Konstantin Mishchenko
Learning Noisy OR Bayesian Networks with Max-Product Belief Propagation	"Noisy-OR Bayesian Networks (BNs) are a family of probabilistic graphical models which express rich statistical dependencies in binary data. Variational inference (VI) has been the main method proposed to learn noisy-OR BNs with complex latent structures (Jaakkola & Jordan, 1999; Ji et al., 2020; Buhai et al., 2020). However, the proposed VI approaches either (a) use a recognition network with standard amortized inference that cannot induce ""explaining-away""; or (b) assume a simple mean-field (MF) posterior which is vulnerable to bad local optima. Existing MF VI methods also update the MF parameters sequentially which makes them inherently slow. In this paper, we propose parallel max-product as an alternative algorithm for learning noisy-OR BNs with complex latent structures and we derive a fast stochastic training scheme that scales to large datasets. We evaluate both approaches on several benchmarks where VI is the state-of-the-art and show that our method (a) achieves better test performance than Ji et al. (2020) for learning noisy-OR BNs with hierarchical latent structures on large sparse real datasets; (b) recovers a higher number of ground truth parameters than Buhai et al. (2020) from cluttered synthetic scenes; and (c) solves the 2D blind deconvolution problem from Lazaro-Gredilla et al. (2021) and variants - including binary matrix factorization - while VI catastrophically fails and is up to two orders of magnitude slower."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dedieu23a	Antoine Dedieu, Guangyao Zhou, Dileep George, Miguel Lazaro-Gredilla
High Fidelity Image Counterfactuals with Probabilistic Causal Models	We present a general causal generative modelling framework for accurate estimation of high fidelity image counterfactuals with deep structural causal models. Estimation of interventional and counterfactual queries for high-dimensional structured variables, such as images, remains a challenging task. We leverage ideas from causal mediation analysis and advances in generative modelling to design new deep causal mechanisms for structured variables in causal models. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed mechanisms are capable of accurate abduction and estimation of direct, indirect and total effects as measured by axiomatic soundness of counterfactuals.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/de-sousa-ribeiro23a	Fabio De Sousa Ribeiro, Tian Xia, Miguel Monteiro, Nick Pawlowski, Ben Glocker
The Value of Out-of-Distribution Data	Generalization error always improves with more in-distribution data. However, it is an open question what happens as we add out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Intuitively, if the OOD data is quite different, it seems more data would harm generalization error, though if the OOD data are sufficiently similar, much empirical evidence suggests that OOD data can actually improve generalization error. We show a counter-intuitive phenomenon: the generalization error of a task can be a non-monotonic function of the amount of OOD data. Specifically, we prove that generalization error can improve with small amounts of OOD data, and then get worse than no OOD data with larger amounts. In other words, there is value in training on small amounts of OOD data. We analytically demonstrate these results via Fisher's Linear Discriminant on synthetic datasets, and empirically demonstrate them via deep networks on computer vision benchmarks such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, CINIC-10, PACS and DomainNet. In the idealistic setting where we know which samples are OOD, we show that these non-monotonic trends can be exploited using an appropriately weighted objective of the target and OOD empirical risk. While its practical utility is limited, this does suggest that if we can detect OOD samples, then there may be ways to benefit from them. When we do not know which samples are OOD, we show how a number of go-to strategies such as data-augmentation, hyper-parameter optimization and pre-training are not enough to ensure that the target generalization error does not deteriorate with the number of OOD samples in the dataset.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/de-silva23a	Ashwin De Silva, Rahul Ramesh, Carey Priebe, Pratik Chaudhari, Joshua T Vogelstein
Continuous Spatiotemporal Transformer	Modeling spatiotemporal dynamical systems is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Transformer models have been very successful in NLP and computer vision where they provide interpretable representations of data. However, a limitation of transformers in modeling continuous dynamical systems is that they are fundamentally discrete time and space models and thus have no guarantees regarding continuous sampling. To address this challenge, we present the Continuous Spatiotemporal Transformer (CST), a new transformer architecture that is designed for modeling of continuous systems. This new framework guarantees a continuous and smooth output via optimization in Sobolev space. We benchmark CST against traditional transformers as well as other spatiotemporal dynamics modeling methods and achieve superior performance in a number of tasks on synthetic and real systems, including learning brain dynamics from calcium imaging data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/de-oliveira-fonseca23a	Antonio Henrique De Oliveira Fonseca, Emanuele Zappala, Josue Ortega Caro, David Van Dijk
Pre-computed memory or on-the-fly encoding? A hybrid approach to retrieval augmentation makes the most of your compute	Retrieval-augmented language models such as Fusion-in-Decoder are powerful, setting the state of the art on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks. However, they are also expensive, due to the need to encode a large number of retrieved passages. Some work avoids this cost by pre-encoding a text corpus into a memory and retrieving dense representations directly. However, pre-encoding memory incurs a severe quality penalty as the memory representations are not conditioned on the current input. We propose LUMEN, a hybrid between these two extremes, pre-computing the majority of the retrieval representation and completing the encoding on the fly using a live encoder that is conditioned on the question and fine-tuned for the task. We show that LUMEN significantly outperforms pure memory on multiple question-answering tasks while being much cheaper than FiD, and outperforms both for any given compute budget. Moreover, the advantage of LUMEN over FiD increases with model size.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/de-jong23a	Michiel De Jong, Yury Zemlyanskiy, Nicholas Fitzgerald, Joshua Ainslie, Sumit Sanghai, Fei Sha, William W.

On the Robustness of Randomized Ensembles to Adversarial Perturbations	"Randomized ensemble classifiers (RECs), where one classifier is randomly selected during inference, have emerged as an attractive alternative to traditional ensembling methods for realizing adversarially robust classifiers with limited compute requirements. However, recent works have shown that existing methods for constructing RECs are more vulnerable than initially claimed, casting major doubts on their efficacy and prompting fundamental questions such as: ""When are RECs useful?"", ""What are their limits?"", and ""How do we train them?"". In this work, we first demystify RECs as we derive fundamental results regarding their theoretical limits, necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be useful, and more. Leveraging this new understanding, we propose a new boosting algorithm (BARRE) for training robust RECs, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness at defending against strong $\ell_\infty$ norm-bounded adversaries across various network architectures and datasets.

Mitigating Propagation Failures in Physics-informed Neural Networks using Retain-Resample-Release (R3) Sampling	"Despite the success of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in approximating partial differential equations (PDEs), PINNs can sometimes fail to converge to the correct solution in problems involving complicated PDEs. This is reflected in several recent studies on characterizing the ""failure modes"" of PINNs, although a thorough understanding of the connection between PINN failure modes and sampling strategies is missing. In this paper, we provide a novel perspective of failure modes of PINNs by hypothesizing that training PINNs relies on successful ""propagation"" of solution from initial and/or boundary condition points to interior points. We show that PINNs with poor sampling strategies can get stuck at trivial solutions if there are propagation failures, characterized by highly imbalanced PDE residual fields. To mitigate propagation failures, we propose a novel Retain-Resample-Release sampling (R3) algorithm that can incrementally accumulate collocation points in regions of high PDE residuals with little to no computational overhead. We provide an extension of R3 sampling to respect the principle of causality while solving time-dependent PDEs. We theoretically analyze the behavior of R3 sampling and empirically demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency in comparison with baselines on a variety of PDE problems."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/daw23a	Arka Daw, Jie Bu, Sifan Wang, Paris Perdikaris, Anuj Karpatne
The Persistent Laplacian for Data Science: Evaluating Higher-Order Persistent Spectral Representations of Data	Persistent homology is arguably the most successful technique in Topological Data Analysis. It combines homology, a topological feature of a data set, with persistence, which tracks the evolution of homology over different scales. The persistent Laplacian is a recent theoretical development that combines persistence with the combinatorial Laplacian, the higher-order extension of the well-known graph Laplacian. Crucially, the Laplacian encode both the homology of a data set, and some additional geometric information not captured by the homology. Here, we provide the first investigation into the efficacy of the persistence Laplacian as an embedding of data for downstream classification and regression tasks. We extend the persistent Laplacian to cubical complexes so it can be used on images, then evaluate its performance as an embedding method on the MNIST and MoleculeNet datasets, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms persistent homology across tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/davies23c	Thomas Davies, Zhengchao Wan, Ruben J Sanchez-Garcia
Predictive Flows for Faster Ford-Fulkerson	Recent work has shown that leveraging learned predictions can improve the running time of algorithms for bipartite matching and similar combinatorial problems.

Our proposed method offers strong theoretical performance in terms of the quality of the prediction. We then consider image segmentation, a common use-case of flows in computer vision, and complement our theoretical analysis with strong empirical results.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/davies23b	Sami Davies, Benjamin Moseley, Sergei Vassilvitskii, Yuyan Wang
Fast Combinatorial Algorithms for Min Max Correlation Clustering	We introduce fast algorithms for correlation clustering with respect to the Min Max objective that provide constant factor approximations on complete graphs. Our algorithms are the first purely combinatorial approximation algorithms for this problem. We construct a novel semi-metric on the set of vertices, which we call the correlation metric, that indicates to our clustering algorithms whether pairs of nodes should be in the same cluster. The paper demonstrates empirically that, compared to prior work, our algorithms sacrifice little in the objective quality to obtain significantly better run-time. Moreover, our algorithms scale to larger networks that are effectively intractable for known algorithms.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/davies23a	Sami Davies, Benjamin Moseley, Heather Newman
Hypervolume Knowledge Gradient: A Lookahead Approach for Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization with Partial Information	Bayesian optimization is a popular method for sample efficient multi-objective optimization. However, existing Bayesian optimization techniques fail to effectively exploit common and often-neglected problem structure such as decoupled evaluations, where objectives can be queried independently from one another and each may consume different resources, or multi-fidelity evaluations, where lower fidelity-proxies of the objectives can be evaluated at lower cost. In this work, we propose a general one-step lookahead acquisition function based on the Knowledge Gradient that addresses the complex question of what to evaluate when and at which design points in a principled Bayesian decision-theoretic fashion. Hence, our approach naturally addresses decoupled, multi-fidelity, and standard multi-objective optimization settings in a unified Bayesian decision making framework. By construction, our method is the one-step Bayes-optimal policy for hypervolume maximization. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method improves sample efficiency in a wide variety of synthetic and real-world problems. Furthermore, we show that our method is general-purpose and yields competitive performance in standard (potentially noisy) multi-objective optimization.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/daulton23a	Sam Daulton, Maximilian Balandat, Eytan Bakshy
Interval Bound Interpolation for Few-shot Learning with Few Tasks	Few-shot learning aims to transfer the knowledge acquired from training on a diverse set of tasks to unseen tasks from the same task distribution, with a limited amount of labeled data. The underlying requirement for effective few-shot generalization is to learn a good representation of the task manifold. This becomes more difficult when only a limited number of tasks are available for training. In such a few-task few-shot setting, it is beneficial to explicitly preserve the local neighborhoods from the task manifold and exploit this to generate artificial tasks for training. To this end, we introduce the notion of interval bounds from the provably robust training literature to few-shot learning. The interval bounds are used to characterize neighborhoods around the training tasks. These neighborhoods can then be preserved by minimizing the distance between a task and its respective bounds. We then use a novel strategy to artificially form new tasks for training by interpolating between the available tasks and their respective interval bounds. We apply our framework to both model-agnostic meta-learning as well as prototype-based metric-learning paradigms. The efficacy of our proposed approach is evident from the improved performance on several datasets from diverse domains in comparison to recent methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/datta23a	Shounak Datta, Sankha Subhra Mullick, Anish Chakrabarty, Swagatam Das

Beyond Uniform Lipschitz Condition in Differentially Private Optimization	Most prior results on differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) are derived under the simplistic assumption of uniform Lipschitzness, i.e., the per-sample gradients are uniformly bounded. We generalize uniform Lipschitzness by assuming that the per-sample gradients have sample-dependent upper bounds, i.e., per-sample Lipschitz constants, which themselves may be unbounded. We provide principled guidance on choosing the clip norm in DP-SGD for convex over-parameterized settings satisfying our general version of Lipschitzness when the per-sample Lipschitz constants are bounded; specifically, we recommend tuning the clip norm only till values up to the minimum per-sample Lipschitz constant. This finds application in the private training of a softmax layer on top of a deep network pre-trained on public data. We verify the efficacy of our recommendation via experiments on 8 datasets. Furthermore, we provide new convergence results for DP-SGD on convex and nonconvex functions when the Lipschitz constants are unbounded but have bounded moments, i.e., they are heavy-tailed.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/das23c	Rudrajit Das, Satyen Kale, Zheng Xu, Tong Zhang, Sujay Sanghavi
Efficient List-Decodable Regression using Batches	We demonstrate the use of batches in studying list-decodable linear regression, in which only $\alpha\in (0,1]$ fraction of batches contain genuine samples from a common distribution and the rest can contain arbitrary or even adversarial samples. When genuine batches have $\ge \tilde\Omega(1/\alpha)$ samples each, our algorithm can efficiently find a small list of potential regression parameters, with a high probability that one of them is close to the true parameter. This is the first polynomial time algorithm for list-decodable linear regression, and its sample complexity scales nearly linearly with the dimension of the covariates. The polynomial time algorithm is made possible by the batch structure and may not be feasible without it, as suggested by a recent Statistical Query lower bound (Diakonikolas et al., 2021b).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/das23b	Abhimanyu Das, Ayush Jain, Weihao Kong, Rajat Sen
Image generation with shortest path diffusion	The field of image generation has made significant progress thanks to the introduction of Diffusion Models, which learn to progressively reverse a given image corruption. Recently, a few studies introduced alternative ways of corrupting images in Diffusion Models, with an emphasis on blurring. However, these studies are purely empirical and it remains unclear what is the optimal procedure for corrupting an image. In this work, we hypothesize that the optimal procedure minimizes the length of the path taken when corrupting an image towards a given final state. We propose the Fisher metric for the path length, measured in the space of probability distributions. We compute the shortest path according to this metric, and we show that it corresponds to a combination of image sharpening, rather than blurring, and noise deblurring. While the corruption was chosen arbitrarily in previous work, our Shortest Path Diffusion (SPD) determines uniquely the entire spatiotemporal structure of the corruption. We show that SPD improves on strong baselines without any hyperparameter tuning, and outperforms all previous Diffusion Models based on image blurring. Furthermore, any small deviation from the shortest path leads to worse performance, suggesting that SPD provides the optimal procedure to corrupt images. Our work sheds new light on observations made in recent works and provides a new approach to improve diffusion models on images and other types of data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/das23a	Ayan Das, Stathi Fotiadis, Anil Batra, Farhang Nabiei, Fengting Liao, Sattar Vakili, Da-Shan Shiu, Alberto Bernacchia
Best of Both Worlds Policy Optimization	Policy optimization methods are popular reinforcement learning algorithms in practice and recent works have build theoretical foundation for them by proving $\sqrt{T}$ regret bounds even when the losses are adversarial. Such bounds are tight in the worst case but often overly pessimistic. In this work, we show that by carefully designing the regularizer, bonus terms, and learning rates, one can achieve a more favorable $\text{polylog}(T)$ regret bound when the losses are stochastic, without sacrificing the worst-case guarantee in the adversarial regime. Specifically, we show the first best of both worlds guarantee for policy optimization in tabular MDPs by leveraging either a Tsallis entropy or a Shannon entropy regularizer. Then we show that under known transitions, we can further obtain a first-order regret bound in the adversarial regime by leveraging the log barrier regularizer.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dann23b	Christoph Dann, Chen-Yu Wei, Julian Zimmert
Reinforcement Learning Can Be More Efficient with Multiple Rewards	Reward design is one of the most critical and challenging aspects when formulating a task as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. In practice, it often takes several attempts of reward specification and learning with it in order to find one that leads to sample-efficient learning of the desired behavior. Instead, in this work, we study whether directly incorporating multiple alternate reward formulations of the same task in a single agent can lead to faster learning. We analyze multi-reward extensions of action-elimination algorithms and prove more favorable instance-dependent regret bounds compared to their single-reward counterparts, both in multi-armed bandits and in tabular Markov decision processes. Our bounds scale for each state-action pair with the inverse of the largest gap among all reward functions. This suggests that learning with multiple rewards can indeed be more sample-efficient, as long as the rewards agree on an optimal policy. We further prove that when rewards do not agree, multi-reward action elimination in multi-armed bandits still learns a policy that is good across all reward functions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dann23a	Christoph Dann, Yishay Mansour, Mehryar Mohri
Neural Collapse in Deep Linear Networks: From Balanced to Imbalanced Data	"Modern deep neural networks have achieved impressive performance on tasks from image classification to natural language processing. Surprisingly, these complex systems with massive amounts of parameters exhibit the same structural properties in their last-layer features and classifiers across canonical datasets when training until convergence. In particular, it has been observed that the last-layer features collapse to their class-means, and those class-means are the vertices of a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF). This phenomenon is known as Neural Collapse (NC). Recent papers have theoretically shown that NC emerges in the global minimizers of training problems with the simplified ""unconstrained feature model"". In this context, we take a step further and prove the NC occurrences in deep linear networks for the popular mean squared error (MSE) and cross entropy (CE) losses, showing that global solutions exhibit NC properties across the linear layers. Furthermore, we extend our study to imbalanced data for MSE loss and present the first geometric analysis of NC under bias-free setting. Our results demonstrate the convergence of the last-layer features and classifiers to a geometry consisting of orthogonal vectors, whose lengths depend on the amount of data in their corresponding classes. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical analyses on synthetic and practical network architectures with both balanced and imbalanced scenarios."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dang23b	Hien Dang, Tho Tran Huu, Stanley Osher, Hung The Tran, Nhat Ho, Tan Minh Nguyen
Multiple Thinking Achieving Meta-Ability Decoupling for Object Navigation	We propose a meta-ability decoupling (MAD) paradigm, which brings together various object navigation methods in an architecture system, allowing them to mutually enhance each other and evolve together. Based on the MAD paradigm, we design a multiple thinking (MT) model that leverages distinct thinking to abstract various meta-abilities. Our method decouples meta-abilities from three aspects: input, encoding, and reward while employing the multiple thinking collaboration (MTC) module to promote mutual cooperation between thinking. MAD introduces a novel qualitative and quantitative interpretability system for object navigation. Through extensive experiments on AI2-Thor and RoboTHOR, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both typical and zero-shot object navigation tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dang23a	Ronghao Dang, Lu Chen, Liuyi Wang, Zongtao He, Chengju Liu, Qijun Chen

Trajectory-Aware Eligibility Traces for Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning	Off-policy learning from multistep returns is crucial for sample-efficient reinforcement learning, but counteracting off-policy bias without exacerbating variance is challenging. Classically, off-policy bias is corrected in a per-decision manner: past temporal-difference errors are re-weighted by the instantaneous Importance Sampling (IS) ratio after each action via eligibility traces. Many off-policy algorithms rely on this mechanism, along with differing protocols for cutting the IS ratios (traces) to combat the variance of the IS estimator. Unfortunately, once a trace has been cut, the effect cannot be easily reversed. This has led to the development of credit-assignment strategies that account for multiple past experiences at a time. These trajectory-aware methods have not been extensively analyzed, and their theoretical justification remains uncertain. In this paper, we propose a multistep operator that unifies per-decision and trajectory-aware methods. We prove convergence conditions for our operator in the tabular setting, establishing the first guarantees for several existing methods as well as many new ones. Finally, we introduce Recency-Bounded Importance Sampling (RBIS), which leverages trajectory awareness to perform robustly across $\lambda$-values in an off-policy control task.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/daley23a	Brett Daley, Martha White, Christopher Amato, Marlos C.

Moderately Distributional Exploration for Domain Generalization	Domain generalization (DG) aims to tackle the distribution shift between training domains and unknown target domains. Generating new domains is one of the most effective approaches, yet its performance gain depends on the distribution discrepancy between the generated and target domains. Distributionally robust optimization is promising to tackle distribution discrepancy by exploring domains in an uncertainty set. However, the uncertainty set may be overwhelmingly large, leading to low-confidence prediction in DG. It is because a large uncertainty set could introduce domains containing semantically different factors from training domains. To address this issue, we propose to perform a $\textit{mo}$derately $\textit{d}$istributional $\textit{e}$xploration (MODE) for domain generalization. Specifically, MODE performs distribution exploration in an uncertainty $\textit{subset}$ that shares the same semantic factors with the training domains. We show that MODE can endow models with provable generalization performance on unknown target domains. The experimental results show that MODE achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dai23d	Rui Dai, Yonggang Zhang, Zhen Fang, Bo Han, Xinmei Tian
MultiRobustBench: Benchmarking Robustness Against Multiple Attacks	The bulk of existing research in defending against adversarial examples focuses on defending against a single (typically bounded $\ell_p$-norm) attack, but for a practical setting, machine learning (ML) models should be robust to a wide variety of attacks. In this paper, we present the first unified framework for considering multiple attacks against ML models. Our framework is able to model different levels of learner's knowledge about the test-time adversary, allowing us to model robustness against unforeseen attacks and robustness against unions of attacks. Using our framework, we present the first leaderboard, MultiRobustBench (https://multirobustbench.github.io), for benchmarking multiattack evaluation which captures performance across attack types and attack strengths. We evaluate the performance of 16 defended models for robustness against a set of 9 different attack types, including $\ell_p$-based threat models, spatial transformations, and color changes, at 20 different attack strengths (180 attacks total). Additionally, we analyze the state of current defenses against multiple attacks. Our analysis shows that while existing defenses have made progress in terms of average robustness across the set of attacks used, robustness against the worst-case attack is still a big open problem as all existing models perform worse than random guessing.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dai23c	Sihui Dai, Saeed Mahloujifar, Chong Xiang, Vikash Sehwag, Pin-Yu Chen, Prateek Mittal
Refined Regret for Adversarial MDPs with Linear Function Approximation	We consider learning in an adversarial Markov Decision Process (MDP) where the loss functions can change arbitrarily over $K$ episodes and the state space can be arbitrarily large. We assume that the Q-function of any policy is linear in some known features, that is, a linear function approximation exists. The best existing regret upper bound for this setting (Luo et al., 2021) is of order $\tilde{\mathcal O}(K^{2/3})$ (omitting all other dependencies), given access to a simulator. This paper provides two algorithms that improve the regret to $\tilde{\mathcal O}(\sqrt K)$ in the same setting. Our first algorithm makes use of a refined analysis of the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithm with the log-barrier regularizer. This analysis allows the loss estimators to be arbitrarily negative and might be of independent interest. Our second algorithm develops a magnitude-reduced loss estimator, further removing the polynomial dependency on the number of actions in the first algorithm and leading to the optimal regret bound (up to logarithmic terms and dependency on the horizon). Moreover, we also extend the first algorithm to simulator-free linear MDPs, which achieves $\tilde{\mathcal O}(K^{8/9})$ regret and greatly improves over the best existing bound $\tilde{\mathcal O}(K^{14/15})$. This algorithm relies on a better alternative to the Matrix Geometric Resampling procedure by Neu & Olkhovskaya (2020), which could again be of independent interest.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dai23b	Yan Dai, Haipeng Luo, Chen-Yu Wei, Julian Zimmert
Chameleon: Adapting to Peer Images for Planting Durable Backdoors in Federated Learning	In a federated learning (FL) system, distributed clients upload their local models to a central server to aggregate into a global model. Malicious clients may plant backdoors into the global model through uploading poisoned local models, causing images with specific patterns to be misclassified into some target labels. Backdoors planted by current attacks are not durable, and vanish quickly once the attackers stop model poisoning. In this paper, we investigate the connection between the durability of FL backdoors and the relationships between benign images and poisoned images (i.e., the images whose labels are flipped to the target label during local training). Specifically, benign images with the original and the target labels of the poisoned images are found to have key effects on backdoor durability. Consequently, we propose a novel attack, Chameleon, which utilizes contrastive learning to further amplify such effects towards a more durable backdoor. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chameleon significantly extends the backdoor lifespan over baselines by $1.2\times \sim 4\times$, for a wide range of image datasets, backdoor types, and model architectures.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dai23a	Yanbo Dai, Songze Li
From Noisy Fixed-Point Iterations to Private ADMM for Centralized and Federated Learning	We study differentially private (DP) machine learning algorithms as instances of noisy fixed-point iterations, in order to derive privacy and utility results from this well-studied framework. We show that this new perspective recovers popular private gradient-based methods like DP-SGD and provides a principled way to design and analyze new private optimization algorithms in a flexible manner. Focusing on the widely-used Alternating Directions Method of Multipliers (ADMM) method, we use our general framework derive novel private ADMM algorithms for centralized, federated and fully decentralized learning. We establish strong privacy guarantees for these algorithms, leveraging privacy amplification by iteration and by subsampling. Finally, we provide utility guarantees for the three algorithms using a unified analysis that exploits a recent linear convergence result for noisy fixed-point iterations.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cyffers23a	Edwige Cyffers, Aurélien Bellet, Debabrota Basu

In Search of Insights, Not Magic Bullets: Towards Demystification of the Model Selection Dilemma in Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation	Personalized treatment effect estimates are often of interest in high-stakes applications – thus, before deploying a model estimating such effects in practice, one needs to be sure that the best candidate from the ever-growing machine learning toolbox for this task was chosen. Unfortunately, due to the absence of counterfactual information in practice, it is usually not possible to rely on standard validation metrics for doing so, leading to a well-known model selection dilemma in the treatment effect estimation literature. While some solutions have recently been investigated, systematic understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different model selection criteria is still lacking. In this paper, instead of attempting to declare a global 'winner', we therefore empirically investigate success- and failure modes of different selection criteria. We highlight that there is a complex interplay between selection strategies, candidate estimators and the data used for comparing them, and provide interesting insights into the relative (dis)advantages of different criteria alongside desiderata for the design of further illuminating empirical studies in this context.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/curth23b	Alicia Curth, Mihaela Van Der Schaar
Adaptive Identification of Populations with Treatment Benefit in Clinical Trials: Machine Learning Challenges and Solutions	We study the problem of adaptively identifying patient subpopulations that benefit from a given treatment during a confirmatory clinical trial. This type of adaptive clinical trial has been thoroughly studied in biostatistics, but has been allowed only limited adaptivity so far. Here, we aim to relax classical restrictions on such designs and investigate how to incorporate ideas from the recent machine learning literature on adaptive and online experimentation to make trials more flexible and efficient. We find that the unique characteristics of the subpopulation selection problem – most importantly that (i) one is usually interested in finding subpopulations with any treatment benefit (and not necessarily the single subgroup with largest effect) given a limited budget and that (ii) effectiveness only has to be demonstrated across the subpopulation on average – give rise to interesting challenges and new desiderata when designing algorithmic solutions. Building on these findings, we propose AdaGGI and AdaGCPI, two meta-algorithms for subpopulation construction. We empirically investigate their performance across a range of simulation scenarios and derive insights into their (dis)advantages across different settings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/curth23a	Alicia Curth, Alihan Hüyük, Mihaela Van Der Schaar
Learning Dynamic Query Combinations for Transformer-based Object Detection and Segmentation	Transformer-based detection and segmentation methods use a list of learned detection queries to retrieve information from the transformer network and learn to predict the location and category of one specific object from each query. We empirically find that random convex combinations of the learned queries are still good for the corresponding models. We then propose to learn a convex combination with dynamic coefficients based on the high-level semantics of the image. The generated dynamic queries, named as modulated queries, better capture the prior of object locations and categories in the different images. Equipped with our modulated queries, a wide range of DETR-based models achieve consistent and superior performance across multiple tasks (object detection, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation) and on different benchmarks (MS COCO, CityScapes, YoutubeVIS).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cui23f	Yiming Cui, Linjie Yang, Haichao Yu
Scaling Up Dataset Distillation to ImageNet-1K with Constant Memory	Dataset Distillation is a newly emerging area that aims to distill large datasets into much smaller and highly informative synthetic ones to accelerate training and reduce storage. Among various dataset distillation methods, trajectory-matching-based methods (MTT) have achieved SOTA performance in many tasks, e.g., on CIFAR-10/100. However, due to exorbitant memory consumption when unrolling optimization through SGD steps, MTT fails to scale to large-scale datasets such as ImageNet-1K. Can we scale this SOTA method to ImageNet-1K and does its effectiveness on CIFAR transfer to ImageNet-1K? To answer these questions, we first propose a procedure to exactly compute the unrolled gradient with constant memory complexity, which allows us to scale MTT to ImageNet-1K seamlessly with $\sim 6$x reduction in memory footprint. We further discover that it is challenging for MTT to handle datasets with a large number of classes, and propose a novel soft label assignment that drastically improves its convergence. The resulting algorithm sets new SOTA on ImageNet-1K: we can scale up to 50 IPCs (Image Per Class) on ImageNet-1K on a single GPU (all previous methods can only scale to 2 IPCs on ImageNet-1K), leading to the best accuracy (only 5.9% accuracy drop against full dataset training) while utilizing only 4.2% of the number of data points - an 18.2% absolute gain over prior SOTA.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cui23e	Justin Cui, Ruochen Wang, Si Si, Cho-Jui Hsieh
IRNeXt: Rethinking Convolutional Network Design for Image Restoration	We present IRNeXt, a simple yet effective convolutional network architecture for image restoration. Recently, Transformer models have dominated the field of image restoration due to the powerful ability of modeling long-range pixels interactions. In this paper, we excavate the potential of the convolutional neural network (CNN) and show that our CNN-based model can receive comparable or better performance than Transformer models with low computation overhead on several image restoration tasks. By re-examining the characteristics possessed by advanced image restoration algorithms, we discover several key factors leading to the performance improvement of restoration models. This motivates us to develop a novel network for image restoration based on cheap convolution operators. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that IRNeXt delivers state-of-the-art performance among numerous datasets on a range of image restoration tasks with low computational complexity, including image dehazing, single-image defocus/motion deblurring, image deraining, and image desnowing. https://github.com/c-yn/IRNeXt.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cui23d	Yuning Cui, Wenqi Ren, Sining Yang, Xiaochun Cao, Alois Knoll
A General Representation Learning Framework with Generalization Performance Guarantees	The generalization performance of machine learning methods depends heavily on the quality of data representation. However, existing researches rarely consider representation learning from the perspective of generalization error. In this paper, we prove that generalization error of representation learning function can be estimated effectively by solving two convex optimization problems. Based on it, we propose a general representation learning framework. And then, we apply the proposed framework to two most commonly used nonlinear mapping methods, i.e., kernel based method and deep neural network (DNN), and thus design a kernel selection method and a DNN boosting framework, correspondingly. Finally, extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cui23c	Junbiao Cui, Jianqing Liang, Qin Yue, Jiye Liang
Bayes-optimal Learning of Deep Random Networks of Extensive-width	We consider the problem of learning a target function corresponding to a deep, extensive-width, non-linear neural network with random Gaussian weights. We consider the asymptotic limit where the number of samples, the input dimension and the network width are proportionally large and propose a closed-form expression for the Bayes-optimal test error, for regression and classification tasks. We further compute closed-form expressions for the test errors of ridge regression, kernel and random features regression. We find, in particular, that optimally regularized ridge regression, as well as kernel regression, achieve Bayes-optimal performances, while the logistic loss yields a near-optimal test error for classification. We further show numerically that when the number of samples grows faster than the dimension, ridge and kernel methods become suboptimal, while neural networks achieve test error close to zero from quadratically many samples.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cui23b	Hugo Cui, Florent Krzakala, Lenka Zdeborova
Rethinking Weak Supervision in Helping Contrastive Learning	Contrastive learning has shown outstanding performances in both supervised and unsupervised learning, and has recently been introduced to solve weakly supervised learning problems such as semi-supervised learning and noisy label learning. Despite the empirical evidence showing that semi-supervised labels improve the representations of contrastive learning, it remains unknown if noisy supervised information can be directly used in training instead of after manual denoising. Therefore, to explore the mechanical differences between semi-supervised and noisy-labeled information in helping contrastive learning, we establish a unified theoretical framework of contrastive learning under weak supervision. Specifically, we investigate the most intuitive paradigm of jointly training supervised and unsupervised contrastive losses. By translating the weakly supervised information into a similarity graph under the framework of spectral clustering based on the posterior probability of weak labels, we establish the downstream classification error bound. We prove that semi-supervised labels improve the downstream error bound whereas noisy labels have limited effects under such a paradigm. Our theoretical findings here provide new insights for the community to rethink the role of weak supervision in helping contrastive learning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cui23a	Jingyi Cui, Weiran Huang, Yifei Wang, Yisen Wang
Learning to Maximize Mutual Information for Dynamic Feature Selection	Feature selection helps reduce data acquisition costs in ML, but the standard approach is to train models with static feature subsets. Here, we consider the dynamic feature selection (DFS) problem where a model sequentially queries features based on the presently available information. DFS is often addressed with reinforcement learning, but we explore a simpler approach of greedily selecting features based on their conditional mutual information. This method is theoretically appealing but requires oracle access to the data distribution, so we develop a learning approach based on amortized optimization. The proposed method is shown to recover the greedy policy when trained to optimality, and it outperforms numerous existing feature selection methods in our experiments, thus validating it as a simple but powerful approach for this problem.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/covert23a	Ian Connick Covert, Wei Qiu, Mingyu Lu, Na Yoon Kim, Nathan J White, Su-In Lee
A Mathematical Model for Curriculum Learning for Parities	Curriculum learning (CL)- training using samples that are generated and presented in a meaningful order - was introduced in the machine learning context around a decade ago. While CL has been extensively used and analysed empirically, there has been very little mathematical justification for its advantages. We introduce a CL model for learning the class of k-parities on d bits of a binary string with a neural network trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We show that a wise choice of training examples, involving two or more product distributions, allows to reduce significantly the computational cost of learning this class of functions, compared to learning under the uniform distribution. We conduct experiments to support our analysis. Furthermore, we show that for another class of functions - namely the 'Hamming mixtures' - CL strategies involving a bounded number of product distributions are not beneficial.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cornacchia23a	Elisabetta Cornacchia, Elchanan Mossel
Task-specific experimental design for treatment effect estimation	Understanding causality should be a core requirement of any attempt to build real impact through AI. Due to the inherent unobservability of counterfactuals, large randomised trials (RCTs) are the standard for causal inference. But large experiments are generically expensive, and randomisation carries its own costs, e.g. when suboptimal decisions are trialed. Recent work has proposed more sample-efficient alternatives to RCTs, but these are not adaptable to the downstream application for which the causal effect is sought. In this work, we develop a task-specific approach to experimental design and derive sampling strategies customised to particular downstream applications. Across a range of important tasks, real-world datasets, and sample sizes, our method outperforms other benchmarks, e.g. requiring an order-of-magnitude less data to match RCT performance on targeted marketing tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/connolly23a	Bethany Connolly, Kim Moore, Tobias Schwedes, Alexander Adam, Gary Willis, Ilya Feige, Christopher Frye
Inferring Relational Potentials in Interacting Systems	Systems consisting of interacting agents are prevalent in the world, ranging from dynamical systems in physics to complex biological networks. To build systems which can interact robustly in the real world, it is thus important to be able to infer the precise interactions governing such systems. Existing approaches typically discover such interactions by explicitly modeling the feed-forward dynamics of the trajectories. In this work, we propose Neural Interaction Inference with Potentials (NIIP) as an alternative approach to discover such interactions that enables greater flexibility in trajectory modeling: it discovers a set of relational potentials, represented as energy functions, which when minimized reconstruct the original trajectory. NIIP assigns low energy to the subset of trajectories which respect the relational constraints observed. We illustrate that with these representations NIIP displays unique capabilities in test-time. First, it allows trajectory manipulation, such as interchanging interaction types across separately trained models, as well as trajectory forecasting. Additionally, it allows adding external hand-crafted potentials at test-time. Finally, NIIP enables the detection of out-of-distribution samples and anomalies without explicit training.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/comas23a	Armand Comas, Yilun Du, Christian Fernandez Lopez, Sandesh Ghimire, Mario Sznaier, Joshua B.

K-SHAP: Policy Clustering Algorithm for Anonymous Multi-Agent State-Action Pairs	Learning agent behaviors from observational data has shown to improve our understanding of their decision-making processes, advancing our ability to explain their interactions with the environment and other agents. While multiple learning techniques have been proposed in the literature, there is one particular setting that has not been explored yet: multi agent systems where agent identities remain anonymous. For instance, in financial markets labeled data that identifies market participant strategies is typically proprietary, and only the anonymous state-action pairs that result from the interaction of multiple market participants are publicly available. As a result, sequences of agent actions are not observable, restricting the applicability of existing work. In this paper, we propose a Policy Clustering algorithm, called K-SHAP, that learns to group anonymous state-action pairs according to the agent policies. We frame the problem as an Imitation Learning (IL) task, and we learn a world-policy able to mimic all the agent behaviors upon different environmental states. We leverage the world-policy to explain each anonymous observation through an additive feature attribution method called SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). Finally, by clustering the explanations we show that we are able to identify different agent policies and group observations accordingly. We evaluate our approach on simulated synthetic market data and a real-world financial dataset. We show that our proposal significantly and consistently outperforms the existing methods, identifying different agent strategies.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/coletta23a	Andrea Coletta, Svitlana Vyetrenko, Tucker Balch
Spatial Implicit Neural Representations for Global-Scale Species Mapping	Estimating the geographical range of a species from sparse observations is a challenging and important geospatial prediction problem. Given a set of locations where a species has been observed, the goal is to build a model to predict whether the species is present or absent at any location. This problem has a long history in ecology, but traditional methods struggle to take advantage of emerging large-scale crowdsourced datasets which can include tens of millions of records for hundreds of thousands of species. In this work, we use Spatial Implicit Neural Representations (SINRs) to jointly estimate the geographical range of 47k species simultaneously. We find that our approach scales gracefully, making increasingly better predictions as we increase the number of species and the amount of data per species when training. To make this problem accessible to machine learning researchers, we provide four new benchmarks that measure different aspects of species range estimation and spatial representation learning. Using these benchmarks, we demonstrate that noisy and biased crowdsourced data can be combined with implicit neural representations to approximate expert-developed range maps for many species.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cole23a	Elijah Cole, Grant Van Horn, Christian Lange, Alexander Shepard, Patrick Leary, Pietro Perona, Scott Loarie, Oisin Mac Aodha
Few-Sample Feature Selection via Feature Manifold Learning	In this paper, we present a new method for few-sample supervised feature selection (FS). Our method first learns the manifold of the feature space of each class using kernels capturing multi-feature associations. Then, based on Riemannian geometry, a composite kernel is computed, extracting the differences between the learned feature associations. Finally, a FS score based on spectral analysis is proposed. Considering multi-feature associations makes our method multivariate by design. This in turn allows for the extraction of the hidden manifold underlying the features and avoids overfitting, facilitating few-sample FS. We showcase the efficacy of our method on illustrative examples and several benchmarks, where our method demonstrates higher accuracy in selecting the informative features compared to competing methods. In addition, we show that our FS leads to improved classification and better generalization when applied to test data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cohen23b	David Cohen, Tal Shnitzer, Yuval Kluger, Ronen Talmon
Sequential Strategic Screening	"We initiate the study of strategic behavior in screening processes with multiple classifiers. We focus on two contrasting settings: a ""conjunctive"" setting in which an individual must satisfy all classifiers simultaneously, and a sequential setting in which an individual to succeed must satisfy classifiers one at a time. In other words, we introduce the combination of strategic classificationwith screening processes. We show that sequential screening pipelines exhibit new and surprising behavior where individuals can exploit the sequential ordering of the tests to ""zig-zag"" between classifiers without having to simultaneously satisfy all of them. We demonstrate an individual can obtain a positive outcome using a limited manipulation budget even when far from the intersection of the positive regions of every classifier. Finally, we consider a learner whose goal is to design a sequential screening process that is robust to such manipulations, and provide a construction for the learner that optimizes a natural objective."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cohen23a	Lee Cohen, Saeed Sharifi -Malvajerdi, Kevin Stangl, Ali Vakilian, Juba Ziani
Distribution Free Prediction Sets for Node Classification	Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are able to achieve high classification accuracy on many important real world datasets, but provide no rigorous notion of predictive uncertainty. Quantifying the confidence of GNN models is difficult due to the dependence between datapoints induced by the graph structure. We leverage recent advances in conformal prediction to construct prediction sets for node classification in inductive learning scenarios. We do this by taking an existing approach for conformal classification that relies on	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/clarkson23a	Jase Clarkson
A Toy Model of Universality: Reverse Engineering how Networks Learn Group Operations	Universality is a key hypothesis in mechanistic interpretability – that different models learn similar features and circuits when trained on similar tasks. In this work, we study the universality hypothesis by examining how small networks learn to implement group compositions. We present a novel algorithm by which neural networks may implement composition for any finite group via mathematical representation theory. We then show that these networks consistently learn this algorithm by reverse engineering model logits and weights, and confirm our understanding using ablations. By studying networks trained on various groups and architectures, we find mixed evidence for universality: using our algorithm, we can completely characterize the family of circuits and features that networks learn on this task, but for a given network the precise circuits learned – as well as the order they develop – are arbitrary.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chughtai23a	Bilal Chughtai, Lawrence Chan, Neel Nanda
InfoOT: Information Maximizing Optimal Transport	Optimal transport aligns samples across distributions by minimizing the transportation cost between them, e.g., the geometric distances. Yet, it ignores coherence structure in the data such as clusters, does not handle outliers well, and cannot integrate new data points. To address these drawbacks, we propose InfoOT, an information-theoretic extension of optimal transport that maximizes the mutual information between domains while minimizing geometric distances. The resulting objective can still be formulated as a (generalized) optimal transport problem, and can be efficiently solved by projected gradient descent. This formulation yields a new projection method that is robust to outliers and generalizes to unseen samples. Empirically, InfoOT improves the quality of alignments across benchmarks in domain adaptation, cross-domain retrieval, and single-cell alignment.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chuang23a	Ching-Yao Chuang, Stefanie Jegelka, David Alvarez-Melis
Multiply Robust Off-policy Evaluation and Learning under Truncation by Death	"Typical off-policy evaluation (OPE) and off-policy learning (OPL) are not well-defined problems under ""truncation by death"", where the outcome of interest is not defined after some events, such as death. The standard OPE no longer yields consistent estimators, and the standard OPL results in suboptimal policies. In this paper, we formulate OPE and OPL using principal stratification under ""truncation by death"". We propose a survivor value function for a subpopulation whose outcomes are always defined regardless of treatment conditions. We establish a novel identification strategy under principal ignorability, and derive the semiparametric efficiency bound of an OPE estimator. Then, we propose multiply robust estimators for OPE and OPL. We show that the proposed estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal even with flexible semi/nonparametric models for nuisance functions approximation. Moreover, under mild rate conditions of nuisance functions approximation, the estimators achieve the semiparametric efficiency bound. Finally, we conduct experiments to demonstrate the empirical performance of the proposed estimators."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chu23c	Jianing Chu, Shu Yang, Wenbin Lu
Shape-Guided Dual-Memory Learning for 3D Anomaly Detection	We present a shape-guided expert-learning framework to tackle the problem of unsupervised 3D anomaly detection. Our method is established on the effectiveness of two specialized expert models and their synergy to localize anomalous regions from color and shape modalities. The first expert utilizes geometric information to probe 3D structural anomalies by modeling the implicit distance fields around local shapes. The second expert considers the 2D RGB features associated with the first expert to identify color appearance irregularities on the local shapes. We use the two experts to build the dual memory banks from the anomaly-free training samples and perform shape-guided inference to pinpoint the defects in the testing samples. Owing to the per-point 3D representation and the effective fusion scheme of complementary modalities, our method efficiently achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset with better recall and lower false positive rates, as preferred in real applications.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chu23b	Yu-Min Chu, Chieh Liu, Ting-I Hsieh, Hwann-Tzong Chen, Tyng-Luh Liu
Wasserstein Barycenter Matching for Graph Size Generalization of Message Passing Neural Networks	Graph size generalization is hard for Message passing neural networks (MPNNs). The graph-level classification performance of MPNNs degrades across various graph sizes. Recently, theoretical studies reveal that a slow uncontrollable convergence rate w.r.t. graph size could adversely affect the size generalization. To address the uncontrollable convergence rate caused by correlations across nodes in the underlying dimensional signal-generating space, we propose to use Wasserstein barycenters as graph-level consensus to combat node-level correlations. Methodologically, we propose a Wasserstein barycenter matching (WBM) layer that represents an input graph by Wasserstein distances between its MPNN-filtered node embeddings versus some learned class-wise barycenters. Theoretically, we show that the convergence rate of an MPNN with a WBM layer is controllable and independent to the dimensionality of the signal-generating space. Thus MPNNs with WBM layers are less susceptible to slow uncontrollable convergence rate and size variations. Empirically, the WBM layer improves the size generalization over vanilla MPNNs with different backbones (e.g., GCN, GIN, and PNA) significantly on real-world graph datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chu23a	Xu Chu, Yujie Jin, Xin Wang, Shanghang Zhang, Yasha Wang, Wenwu Zhu, Hong Mei
Unifying Molecular and Textual Representations via Multi-task Language Modelling	The recent advances in neural language models have also been successfully applied to the field of chemistry, offering generative solutions for classical problems in molecular design and synthesis planning. These new methods have the potential to fuel a new era of data-driven automation in scientific discovery. However, specialized models are still typically required for each task, leading to the need for problem-specific fine-tuning and neglecting task interrelations. The main obstacle in this field is the lack of a unified representation between natural language and chemical representations, complicating and limiting human-machine interaction. Here, we propose the first multi-domain, multi-task language model that can solve a wide range of tasks in both the chemical and natural language domains. Our model can handle chemical and natural language concurrently, without requiring expensive pre-training on single domains or task-specific models. Interestingly, sharing weights across domains remarkably improves our model when benchmarked against state-of-the-art baselines on single-domain and cross-domain tasks. In particular, sharing information across domains and tasks gives rise to large improvements in cross-domain tasks, the magnitude of which increase with scale, as measured by more than a dozen of relevant metrics. Our work suggests that such models can robustly and efficiently accelerate discovery in physical sciences by superseding problem-specific fine-tuning and enhancing human-model interactions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/christofidellis23a	Dimitrios Christofidellis, Giorgio Giannone, Jannis Born, Ole Winther, Teodoro Laino, Matteo Manica
What do CNNs Learn in the First Layer and Why? A Linear Systems Perspective	It has previously been reported that the representation that is learned in the first layer of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is highly consistent across initializations and architectures. In this work, we quantify this consistency by considering the first layer as a filter bank and measuring its energy distribution. We find that the energy distribution is very different from that of the initial weights and is remarkably consistent across random initializations, datasets, architectures and even when the CNNs are trained with	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chowers23a	Rhea Chowers, Yair Weiss
Patch-level Routing in Mixture-of-Experts is Provably Sample-efficient for Convolutional Neural Networks	In deep learning, mixture-of-experts (MoE) activates one or few experts (sub-networks) on a per-sample or per-token basis, resulting in significant computation reduction. The recently proposed patch-level routing in MoE (pMoE) divides each input into $n$ patches (or tokens) and sends $l$ patches ($l\ll n$) to each expert through prioritized routing. pMoE has demonstrated great empirical success in reducing training and inference costs while maintaining test accuracy. However, the theoretical explanation of pMoE and the general MoE remains elusive. Focusing on a supervised classification task using a mixture of two-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we show for the first time that pMoE provably reduces the required number of training samples to achieve desirable generalization (referred to as the sample complexity) by a factor in the polynomial order of $n/l$, and outperforms its single-expert counterpart of the same or even larger capacity. The advantage results from the discriminative routing property, which is justified in both theory and practice that pMoE routers can filter label-irrelevant patches and route similar class-discriminative patches to the same expert. Our experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA support our theoretical findings on pMoE's generalization and show that pMoE can avoid learning spurious correlations.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chowdhury23a	Mohammed Nowaz Rabbani Chowdhury, Shuai Zhang, Meng Wang, Sijia Liu, Pin-Yu Chen
Forget Unlearning: Towards True Data-Deletion in Machine Learning	Unlearning algorithms aim to remove deleted data's influence from trained models at a cost lower than full retraining. However, prior guarantees of unlearning in literature are flawed and don't protect the privacy of deleted records. We show that when people delete their data as a function of published models, records in a database become interdependent. So, even retraining a fresh model after deletion of a record doesn't ensure its privacy. Secondly, unlearning algorithms that cache partial computations to speed up the processing can leak deleted information over a series of releases, violating the privacy of deleted records in the long run. To address these, we propose a sound deletion guarantee and show that ensuring the privacy of existing records is necessary for the privacy of deleted records. Under this notion, we propose an optimal, computationally efficient, and sound machine unlearning algorithm based on noisy gradient descent.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chourasia23a	Rishav Chourasia, Neil Shah
ContraBAR: Contrastive Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL	In meta reinforcement learning (meta RL), an agent seeks a Bayes-optimal policy – the optimal policy when facing an unknown task that is sampled from some known task distribution. Previous approaches tackled this problem by inferring a $\textit{belief}$ over task parameters, using variational inference methods. Motivated by recent successes of contrastive learning approaches in RL, such as contrastive predictive coding (CPC), we investigate whether contrastive methods can be used for learning Bayes-optimal behavior. We begin by proving that representations learned by CPC are indeed sufficient for Bayes optimality. Based on this observation, we propose a simple meta RL algorithm that uses CPC in lieu of variational belief inference. Our method, $\textit{ContraBAR}$, achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art in domains with state-based observation and circumvents the computational toll of future observation reconstruction, enabling learning in domains with image-based observations. It can also be combined with image augmentations for domain randomization and used seamlessly in both online and offline meta RL settings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/choshen23a	Era Choshen, Aviv Tamar
Efficient Graph Field Integrators Meet Point Clouds	We present two new classes of algorithms for efficient field integration on graphs encoding point cloud data. The first class, $\mathrm{SeparatorFactorization}$ (SF), leverages the bounded genus of point cloud mesh graphs, while the second class, $\mathrm{RFDiffusion}$ (RFD), uses popular $\epsilon$-nearest-neighbor graph representations for point clouds. Both can be viewed as providing the functionality of Fast Multipole Methods (FMMs), which have had a tremendous impact on efficient integration, but for non-Euclidean spaces. We focus on geometries induced by distributions of walk lengths between points (e.g. shortest-path distance). We provide an extensive theoretical analysis of our algorithms, obtaining new results in structural graph theory as a byproduct. We also perform exhaustive empirical evaluation, including on-surface interpolation for rigid and deformable objects (in particular for mesh-dynamics modeling) as well as Wasserstein distance computations for point clouds, including the Gromov-Wasserstein variant.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/choromanski23b	Krzysztof Marcin Choromanski, Arijit Sehanobish, Han Lin, Yunfan Zhao, Eli Berger, Tetiana Parshakova, Alvin Pan, David Watkins, Tianyi Zhang, Valerii Likhosherstov, Somnath Basu Roy Chowdhury, Kumar Avinava Dubey, Deepali Jain, Tamas Sarlos, Snigdha Chaturvedi, Adrian Weller
Taming graph kernels with random features	We introduce in this paper the mechanism of graph random features (GRFs). GRFs can be used to construct unbiased randomized estimators of several important kernels defined on graphs' nodes, in particular the regularized Laplacian kernel. As regular RFs for non-graph kernels, they provide means to scale up kernel methods defined on graphs to larger networks. Importantly, they give substantial computational gains also for smaller graphs, while applied in downstream applications. Consequently, GRFs address the notoriously difficult problem of cubic (in the number of the nodes of the graph) time complexity of graph kernels algorithms. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of GRFs and an extensive empirical evaluation: from speed tests, through Frobenius relative error analysis to kmeans graph-clustering with graph kernels. We show that the computation of GRFs admits an embarrassingly simple distributed algorithm that can be applied if the graph under consideration needs to be split across several machines. We also introduce a (still unbiased) quasi Monte Carlo variant of GRFs, q-GRFs, relying on the so-called reinforced random walks that might be used to optimize the variance of GRFs. As a byproduct, we obtain a novel approach to solve certain classes of linear equations with positive and symmetric matrices.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/choromanski23a	Krzysztof Marcin Choromanski
Multi-Epoch Matrix Factorization Mechanisms for Private Machine Learning	We introduce new differentially private (DP) mechanisms for gradient-based machine learning (ML) with multiple passes (epochs) over a dataset, substantially improving the achievable privacy-utility-computation tradeoffs. We formalize the problem of DP mechanisms for adaptive streams with multiple participations and introduce a non-trivial extension of online matrix factorization DP mechanisms to our setting. This includes establishing the necessary theory for sensitivity calculations and efficient computation of optimal matrices. For some applications like $>\!\! 10,000$ SGD steps, applying these optimal techniques becomes computationally expensive. We thus design an efficient Fourier-transform-based mechanism with only a minor utility loss. Extensive empirical evaluation on both example-level DP for image classification and user-level DP for language modeling demonstrate substantial improvements over all previous methods, including the widely-used DP-SGD. Though our primary application is to ML, our main DP results are applicable to arbitrary linear queries and hence may have much broader applicability.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/choquette-choo23a	Christopher A.

Computational Doob h-transforms for Online Filtering of Discretely Observed Diffusions	This paper is concerned with online filtering of discretely observed nonlinear diffusion processes. Our approach is based on the fully adapted auxiliary particle filter, which involves Doob's $h$-transforms that are typically intractable. We propose a computational framework to approximate these $h$-transforms by solving the underlying backward Kolmogorov equations using nonlinear Feynman-Kac formulas and neural networks. The methodology allows one to train a locally optimal particle filter prior to the data-assimilation procedure. Numerical experiments illustrate that the proposed approach can be orders of magnitude more efficient than state-of-the-art particle filters in the regime of highly informative observations, when the observations are extreme under the model, and if the state dimension is large.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chopin23a	Nicolas Chopin, Andras Fulop, Jeremy Heng, Alexandre H.

New metrics and search algorithms for weighted causal DAGs	Recovering causal relationships from data is an important problem.

In the typical well-studied setting, the learning algorithm is given the essential graph for the observational distribution and is asked to recover the underlying causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) $G^*$ while minimizing the number of interventions made. In our setting, we are additionally given side information about $G^*$ as advice, e.g. a DAG $G$ purported to be $G^*$. We ask whether the learning algorithm can benefit from the advice when it is close to being correct, while still having worst-case guarantees even when the advice is arbitrarily bad.

Concept-based Explanations for Out-of-Distribution Detectors	Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the safe deployment of deep neural network (DNN) classifiers. While a myriad of methods have focused on improving the performance of OOD detectors, a critical gap remains in interpreting their decisions. We help bridge this gap by providing explanations for OOD detectors based on learned high-level concepts. We first propose two new metrics for assessing the effectiveness of a particular set of concepts for explaining OOD detectors: 1) detection completeness, which quantifies the sufficiency of concepts for explaining an OOD-detector's decisions, and 2) concept separability, which captures the distributional separation between in-distribution and OOD data in the concept space. Based on these metrics, we propose an unsupervised framework for learning a set of concepts that satisfy the desired properties of high detection completeness and concept separability, and demonstrate its effectiveness in providing concept-based explanations for diverse off-the-shelf OOD detectors. We also show how to identify prominent concepts contributing to the detection results, and provide further reasoning about their decisions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/choi23e	Jihye Choi, Jayaram Raghuram, Ryan Feng, Jiefeng Chen, Somesh Jha, Atul Prakash
Restoration based Generative Models	Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) have recently attracted increasing attention by showing impressive synthesis quality. DDMs are built on a diffusion process that pushes data to the noise distribution and the models learn to denoise. In this paper, we establish the interpretation of DDMs in terms of image restoration (IR). Integrating IR literature allows us to use an alternative objective and diverse forward processes, not confining to the diffusion process. By imposing prior knowledge on the loss function grounded on MAP-based estimation, we eliminate the need for the expensive sampling of DDMs. Also, we propose a multi-scale training, which improves the performance compared to the diffusion process, by taking advantage of the flexibility of the forward process. Experimental results demonstrate that our model improves the quality and efficiency of both training and inference. Furthermore, we show the applicability of our model to inverse problems. We believe that our framework paves the way for designing a new type of flexible general generative model.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/choi23d	Jaemoo Choi, Yesom Park, Myungjoo Kang

Is Overfitting Necessary for Implicit Video Representation?	Compact representation of multimedia signals using implicit neural representations (INRs) has advanced significantly over the past few years, and recent works address their applications to video. Existing studies on video INR have focused on network architecture design as all video information is contained within network parameters. Here, we propose a new paradigm in efficient INR for videos based on the idea of strong lottery ticket (SLT) hypothesis (Zhou et al., 2019), which demonstrates the possibility of finding an accurate subnetwork mask, called supermask, for a randomly initialized classification network without weight training. Specifically, we train multiple supermasks with a hierarchical structure for a randomly initialized image-wise video representation model without weight updates. Different from a previous approach employing hierarchical supermasks (Okoshi et al., 2022), a trainable scale parameter for each mask is used instead of multiplying by the same fixed scale for all levels. This simple modification widens the parameter search space to sufficiently explore various sparsity patterns, leading the proposed algorithm to find stronger subnetworks. Moreover, extensive experiments on popular UVG benchmark show that random subnetworks obtained from our framework achieve higher reconstruction and visual quality than fully trained models with similar encoding sizes. Our study is the first to demonstrate the existence of SLTs in video INR models and propose an efficient method for finding them.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/choi23b	Hee Min Choi, Hyoa Kang, Dokwan Oh
GREAD: Graph Neural Reaction-Diffusion Networks	Graph neural networks (GNNs) are one of the most popular research topics for deep learning. GNN methods typically have been designed on top of the graph signal processing theory. In particular, diffusion equations have been widely used for designing the core processing layer of GNNs, and therefore they are inevitably vulnerable to the notorious oversmoothing problem. Recently, a couple of papers paid attention to reaction equations in conjunctions with diffusion equations. However, they all consider limited forms of reaction equations. To this end, we present a reaction-diffusion equation-based GNN method that considers all popular types of reaction equations in addition to one special reaction equation designed by us. To our knowledge, our paper is one of the most comprehensive studies on reaction-diffusion equation-based GNNs. In our experiments with 9 datasets and 28 baselines, our method, called GREAD, outperforms them in a majority of cases. Further synthetic data experiments show that it mitigates the oversmoothing problem and works well for various homophily rates.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/choi23a	Jeongwhan Choi, Seoyoung Hong, Noseong Park, Sung-Bae Cho

Neural Latent Aligner: Cross-trial Alignment for Learning Representations of Complex, Naturalistic Neural Data	Understanding the neural implementation of complex human behaviors is one of the major goals in neuroscience. To this end, it is crucial to find a true representation of the neural data, which is challenging due to the high complexity of behaviors and the low signal-to-ratio (SNR) of the signals. Here, we propose a novel unsupervised learning framework, Neural Latent Aligner (NLA), to find well-constrained, behaviorally relevant neural representations of complex behaviors. The key idea is to align representations across repeated trials to learn cross-trial consistent information. Furthermore, we propose a novel, fully differentiable time warping model (TWM) to resolve the temporal misalignment of trials. When applied to intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) of natural speaking, our model learns better representations for decoding behaviors than the baseline models, especially in lower dimensional space. The TWM is empirically validated by measuring behavioral coherence between aligned trials. The proposed framework learns more cross-trial consistent representations than the baselines, and when visualized, the manifold reveals shared neural trajectories across trials.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cho23a	Cheol Jun Cho, Edward Chang, Gopala Anumanchipalli
Tight Certification of Adversarially Trained Neural Networks via Nonconvex Low-Rank Semidefinite Relaxations	"Adversarial training is well-known to produce high-quality neural network models that are empirically robust against adversarial perturbations. Nevertheless, once a model has been adversarially trained, one often desires a certification that the model is truly robust against all future attacks. Unfortunately, when faced with adversarially trained models, all existing approaches have significant trouble making certifications that are strong enough to be practically useful. Linear programming (LP) techniques in particular face a ""convex relaxation barrier"" that prevent them from making high-quality certifications, even after refinement with mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and branch-and-bound (BnB) techniques. In this paper, we propose a nonconvex certification technique, based on a low-rank restriction of a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. The nonconvex relaxation makes strong certifications comparable to much more expensive SDP methods, while optimizing over dramatically fewer variables comparable to much weaker LP methods. Despite nonconvexity, we show how off-the-shelf local optimization algorithms can be used to achieve and to certify global optimality in polynomial time. Our experiments find that the nonconvex relaxation almost completely closes the gap towards exact certification of adversarially trained models."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chiu23a	Hong-Ming Chiu, Richard Y.

PINA: Leveraging Side Information in eXtreme Multi-label Classification via Predicted Instance Neighborhood Aggregation	The eXtreme Multi-label Classification (XMC) problem seeks to find relevant labels from an exceptionally large label space. Most of the existing XMC learners focus on the extraction of semantic features from input query text. However, conventional XMC studies usually neglect the side information of instances and labels, which can be of use in many real-world applications such as recommendation systems and e-commerce product search. We propose Predicted Instance Neighborhood Aggregation (PINA), a data augmentation method for the general XMC problem that leverages beneficial side information. Unlike most existing XMC frameworks that treat labels and input instances as featureless indicators and independent entries, PINA extracts information from the label metadata and the correlations among training instances. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the consistent gain of PINA on various XMC tasks compared to the state-of-the-art methods: PINA offers a gain in accuracy compared to standard XR-Transformers on five public benchmark datasets. Moreover, PINA achieves a $\sim 5$% gain in accuracy on the largest dataset LF-AmazonTitles-1.3M.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chien23a	Eli Chien, Jiong Zhang, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Jyun-Yu Jiang, Wei-Cheng Chang, Olgica Milenkovic, Hsiang-Fu Yu
Hiding Data Helps: On the Benefits of Masking for Sparse Coding	Sparse coding, which refers to modeling a signal as sparse linear combinations of the elements of a learned dictionary, has proven to be a successful (and interpretable) approach in applications such as signal processing, computer vision, and medical imaging. While this success has spurred much work on provable guarantees for dictionary recovery when the learned dictionary is the same size as the ground-truth dictionary, work on the setting where the learned dictionary is larger (or $\textit{over-realized}$) with respect to the ground truth is comparatively nascent. Existing theoretical results in this setting have been constrained to the case of noise-less data. We show in this work that, in the presence of noise, minimizing the standard dictionary learning objective can fail to recover the elements of the ground-truth dictionary in the over-realized regime, regardless of the magnitude of the signal in the data-generating process. Furthermore, drawing from the growing body of work on self-supervised learning, we propose a novel masking objective for which recovering the ground-truth dictionary is in fact optimal as the signal increases for a large class of data-generating processes. We corroborate our theoretical results with experiments across several parameter regimes showing that our proposed objective also enjoys better empirical performance than the standard reconstruction objective.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chidambaram23b	Muthu Chidambaram, Chenwei Wu, Yu Cheng, Rong Ge
Provably Learning Diverse Features in Multi-View Data with Midpoint Mixup	Mixup is a data augmentation technique that relies on training using random convex combinations of data points and their labels. In recent years, Mixup has become a standard primitive used in the training of state-of-the-art image classification models due to its demonstrated benefits over empirical risk minimization with regards to generalization and robustness. In this work, we try to explain some of this success from a feature learning perspective. We focus our attention on classification problems in which each class may have multiple associated features (or $\textit{views}$) that can be used to predict the class correctly. Our main theoretical results demonstrate that, for a non-trivial class of data distributions with two features per class, training a 2-layer convolutional network using empirical risk minimization can lead to learning only one feature for almost all classes while training with a specific instantiation of Mixup succeeds in learning both features for every class. We also show empirically that these theoretical insights extend to the practical settings of image benchmarks modified to have multiple features.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chidambaram23a	Muthu Chidambaram, Xiang Wang, Chenwei Wu, Rong Ge
Tighter Bounds on the Expressivity of Transformer Encoders	Characterizing neural networks in terms of better-understood formal systems has the potential to yield new insights into the power and limitations of these networks. Doing so for transformers remains an active area of research. Bhattamishra and others have shown that transformer encoders are at least as expressive as a certain kind of counter machine, while Merrill and Sabharwal have shown that fixed-precision transformer encoders recognize only languages in uniform $TC^0$. We connect and strengthen these results by identifying a variant of first-order logic with counting quantifiers that is simultaneously an upper bound for fixed-precision transformer encoders and a lower bound for transformer encoders. This brings us much closer than before to an exact characterization of the languages that transformer encoders recognize.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chiang23a	David Chiang, Peter Cholak, Anand Pillay

Mu$^2$SLAM: Multitask, Multilingual Speech and Language Models	We present Mu$^2$SLAM, a multilingual sequence-to-sequence model pre-trained jointly on unlabeled speech, unlabeled text and supervised data spanning Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Automatic Speech Translation (AST) and Machine Translation (MT), in over 100 languages. By leveraging a quantized representation of speech as a target, Mu$^2$SLAM trains the speech-text models with a sequence-to-sequence masked denoising objective similar to T5 on the decoder and a masked language modeling objective (MLM) on the encoder, for both unlabeled speech and text, while utilizing the supervised tasks to improve cross-lingual and cross-modal representation alignment within the model. On CoVoST AST, Mu$^2$SLAM establishes a new state-of-the-art for models trained on public datasets, improving on xx-en translation over the previous best by 1.9 BLEU points and on en-xx translation by 1.1 BLEU points. On Voxpopuli ASR, our model matches the performance of an mSLAM model fine-tuned with an RNN-T decoder, despite using a relatively weaker Transformer decoder. On text understanding tasks, our model improves by more than 6% over mSLAM on XNLI, getting closer to the performance of mT5 models of comparable capacity on XNLI and TydiQA, paving the way towards a single model for all speech and text understanding tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cheng23e	Yong Cheng, Yu Zhang, Melvin Johnson, Wolfgang Macherey, Ankur Bapna
Parallel Online Clustering of Bandits via Hedonic Game	Contextual bandit algorithms appear in several applications, such as online advertisement and recommendation systems like personalized education or personalized medicine. Individually-tailored recommendations boost the performance of the underlying application; nevertheless, providing individual suggestions becomes costly and even implausible as the number of users grows. As such, to efficiently serve the demands of several users in modern applications, it is imperative to identify the underlying users' clusters, i.e., the groups of users for which a single recommendation might be (near-)optimal. We propose CLUB-HG, a novel algorithm that integrates a game-theoretic approach into clustering inference. Our algorithm achieves Nash equilibrium at each inference step and discovers the underlying clusters. We also provide regret analysis within a standard linear stochastic noise setting. Finally, experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the superior performance of our proposed algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cheng23d	Xiaotong Cheng, Cheng Pan, Setareh Maghsudi
Identification of the Adversary from a Single Adversarial Example	Deep neural networks have been shown vulnerable to adversarial examples. Even though many defense methods have been proposed to enhance the robustness, it is still a long way toward providing an attack-free method to build a trustworthy machine learning system. In this paper, instead of enhancing the robustness, we take the investigator's perspective and propose a new framework to trace the first compromised model copy in a forensic investigation manner. Specifically, we focus on the following setting: the machine learning service provider provides model copies for a set of customers. However, one of the customers conducted adversarial attacks to fool the system. Therefore, the investigator's objective is to identify the first compromised copy by collecting and analyzing evidence from only available adversarial examples. To make the tracing viable, we design a random mask watermarking mechanism to differentiate adversarial examples from different copies. First, we propose a tracing approach in the data-limited case where the original example is also available. Then, we design a data-free approach to identify the adversary without accessing the original example. Finally, the effectiveness of our proposed framework is evaluated by extensive experiments with different model architectures, adversarial attacks, and datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cheng23c	Minhao Cheng, Rui Min, Haochen Sun, Pin-Yu Chen
PLay: Parametrically Conditioned Layout Generation using Latent Diffusion	Layout design is an important task in various design fields, including user interfaces, document, and graphic design. As this task requires tedious manual effort by designers, prior works have attempted to automate this process using generative models, but commonly fell short of providing intuitive user controls and achieving design objectives. In this paper, we build a conditional latent diffusion model, PLay, that generates parametrically conditioned layouts in vector graphic space from user-specified guidelines, which are commonly used by designers for representing their design intents in current practices. Our method outperforms prior works across three datasets on metrics including FID and FD-VG, and in user test. Moreover, it brings a novel and interactive experience to professional layout design processes.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cheng23b	Chin-Yi Cheng, Forrest Huang, Gang Li, Yang Li
Weakly Supervised Regression with Interval Targets	This paper investigates an interesting weakly supervised regression setting called regression with interval targets (RIT). Although some of the previous methods on relevant regression settings can be adapted to RIT, they are not statistically consistent, and thus their empirical performance is not guaranteed. In this paper, we provide a thorough study on RIT. First, we proposed a novel statistical model to describe the data generation process for RIT and demonstrate its validity. Second, we analyze a simple selecting method for RIT, which selects a particular value in the interval as the target value to train the model. Third, we propose a statistically consistent limiting method for RIT to train the model by limiting the predictions to the interval. We further derive an estimation error bound for our limiting method. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cheng23a	Xin Cheng, Yuzhou Cao, Ximing Li, Bo An, Lei Feng
Generalized-Smooth Nonconvex Optimization is As Efficient As Smooth Nonconvex Optimization	Various optimal gradient-based algorithms have been developed for smooth nonconvex optimization. However, many nonconvex machine learning problems do not belong to the class of smooth functions and therefore the existing algorithms are sub-optimal. Instead, these problems have been shown to satisfy certain generalized-smooth conditions, which have not been well understood in the existing literature. In this paper, we propose a notion of $\alpha$-symmetric generalized-smoothness that substantially extends the existing notions and covers many important functions such as high-order polynomials and exponential functions. We study the fundamental properties and establish descent lemmas for the functions in this class. Then, to solve such a large class of nonconvex problems, we design a special deterministic normalized gradient descent algorithm that achieves the optimal iteration complexity $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$, and also prove that the popular SPIDER variance reduction algorithm achieves the optimal sample complexity $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. Our results show that solving generalized-smooth nonconvex problems is as efficient as solving smooth nonconvex problems.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23ar	Ziyi Chen, Yi Zhou, Yingbin Liang, Zhaosong Lu
Lifelong Language Pretraining with Distribution-Specialized Experts	Pretraining on a large-scale corpus has become a standard method to build general language models (LMs). Adapting a model to new data distributions targeting different downstream tasks poses significant challenges. Naive fine-tuning may incur catastrophic forgetting when the over-parameterized LMs overfit the new data but fail to preserve the pretrained features. Lifelong learning (LLL) aims to enable information systems to learn from a continuous data stream across time. However, most prior work modifies the training recipe assuming a static fixed network architecture. We find that additional model capacity and proper regularization are key elements to achieving strong LLL performance. Thus, we propose Lifelong-MoE, an extensible MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) architecture that dynamically adds model capacity via adding experts with regularized pretaining. Our results show that by only introducing a limited number of extra experts while keeping the computation cost constant, our model can steadily adapt to data distribution shifts while preserving the previous knowledge. Compared to existing lifelong learning approaches, Lifelong-MoE achieves better few-shot performance on NLP tasks. More impressively, Lifelong-MoE surpasses multi-task learning on 19 downstream NLU tasks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23aq	Wuyang Chen, Yanqi Zhou, Nan Du, Yanping Huang, James Laudon, Zhifeng Chen, Claire Cui
Learning to Jump: Thinning and Thickening Latent Counts for Generative Modeling	Learning to denoise has emerged as a prominent paradigm to design state-of-the-art deep generative models for natural images. How to use it to model the distributions of both continuous real-valued data and categorical data has been well studied in recently proposed diffusion models. However, it is found in this paper to have limited ability in modeling some other types of data, such as count and non-negative continuous data, that are often highly sparse, skewed, heavy-tailed, and/or overdispersed. To this end, we propose learning to jump as a general recipe for generative modeling of various types of data. Using a forward count thinning process to construct learning objectives to train a deep neural network, it employs a reverse count thickening process to iteratively refine its generation through that network. We demonstrate when learning to jump is expected to perform comparably to learning to denoise, and when it is expected to perform better. For example, learning to jump is recommended when the training data is non-negative and exhibits strong sparsity, skewness, heavy-tailedness, and/or heterogeneity.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23ap	Tianqi Chen, Mingyuan Zhou
Bidirectional Learning for Offline Model-based Biological Sequence Design	Offline model-based optimization aims to maximize a black-box objective function with a static dataset of designs and their scores. In this paper, we focus on biological sequence design to maximize some sequence score. A recent approach employs bidirectional learning, combining a forward mapping for exploitation and a backward mapping for constraint, and it relies on the neural tangent kernel (NTK) of an infinitely wide network to build a proxy model. Though effective, the NTK cannot learn features because of its parametrization, and its use prevents the incorporation of powerful pre-trained Language Models (LMs) that can capture the rich biophysical information in millions of biological sequences. We adopt an alternative proxy model, adding a linear head to a pre-trained LM, and propose a linearization scheme. This yields a closed-form loss and also takes into account the biophysical information in the pre-trained LM. In addition, the forward mapping and the backward mapping play different roles and thus deserve different weights during sequence optimization. To achieve this, we train an auxiliary model and leverage its weak supervision signal via a bi-level optimization framework to effectively learn how to balance the two mappings. Further, by extending the framework, we develop the first learning rate adaptation module	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23ao	Can Chen, Yingxue Zhang, Xue Liu, Mark Coates
Context-Aware Bayesian Network Actor-Critic Methods for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning	Executing actions in a correlated manner is a common strategy for human coordination that often leads to better cooperation, which is also potentially beneficial for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, the recent success of MARL relies heavily on the convenient paradigm of purely decentralized execution, where there is no action correlation among agents for scalability considerations. In this work, we introduce a Bayesian network to inaugurate correlations between agents' action selections in their joint policy. Theoretically, we establish a theoretical justification for why action dependencies are beneficial by deriving the multi-agent policy gradient formula under such a Bayesian network joint policy and proving its global convergence to Nash equilibria under tabular softmax policy parameterization in cooperative Markov games. Further, by equipping existing MARL algorithms with a recent method of differentiable directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), we develop practical algorithms to learn the context-aware Bayesian network policies in scenarios with partial observability and various difficulty. We also dynamically decrease the sparsity of the learned DAG throughout the training process, which leads to weakly or even purely independent policies for decentralized execution. Empirical results on a range of MARL benchmarks show the benefits of our approach.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23an	Dingyang Chen, Qi Zhang
Sketched Ridgeless Linear Regression: The Role of Downsampling	Overparametrization often helps improve the generalization performance. This paper presents a dual view of overparametrization suggesting that downsampling may also help generalize. Focusing on the proportional regime $m\asymp n \asymp p$, where $m$ represents the sketching size, $n$ is the sample size, and $p$ is the feature dimensionality, we investigate two out-of-sample prediction risks of the sketched ridgeless least square estimator. Our findings challenge conventional beliefs by showing that downsampling does not always harm generalization but can actually improve it in certain cases. We identify the optimal sketching size that minimizes out-of-sample prediction risks and demonstrate that the optimally sketched estimator exhibits stabler risk curves, eliminating the peaks of those for the full-sample estimator. To facilitate practical implementation, we propose an empirical procedure to determine the optimal sketching size. Finally, we extend our analysis to cover central limit theorems and misspecified models. Numerical studies strongly support our theory.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23am	Xin Chen, Yicheng Zeng, Siyue Yang, Qiang Sun
How to address monotonicity for model risk management?	In this paper, we study the problem of establishing the accountability and fairness of transparent machine learning models through monotonicity. Although there have been numerous studies on individual monotonicity, pairwise monotonicity is often overlooked in the existing literature. This paper studies transparent neural networks in the presence of three types of monotonicity: individual monotonicity, weak pairwise monotonicity, and strong pairwise monotonicity. As a means of achieving monotonicity while maintaining transparency, we propose the monotonic groves of neural additive models. As a result of empirical examples, we demonstrate that monotonicity is often violated in practice and that monotonic groves of neural additive models are transparent, accountable, and fair.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23al	Dangxing Chen, Weicheng Ye
A Gromov-Wasserstein Geometric View of Spectrum-Preserving Graph Coarsening	Graph coarsening is a technique for solving large-scale graph problems by working on a smaller version of the original graph, and possibly interpolating the results back to the original graph. It has a long history in scientific computing and has recently gained popularity in machine learning, particularly in methods that preserve the graph spectrum. This work studies graph coarsening from a different perspective, developing a theory for preserving graph distances and proposing a method to achieve this. The geometric approach is useful when working with a collection of graphs, such as in graph classification and regression. In this study, we consider a graph as an element on a metric space equipped with the Gromov–Wasserstein (GW) distance, and bound the difference between the distance of two graphs and their coarsened versions. Minimizing this difference can be done using the popular weighted kernel $K$-means method, which improves existing spectrum-preserving methods with the proper choice of the kernel. The study includes a set of experiments to support the theory and method, including approximating the GW distance, preserving the graph spectrum, classifying graphs using spectral information, and performing regression using graph convolutional networks. Code is available at https://github.com/ychen-stat-ml/GW-Graph-Coarsening.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23ak	Yifan Chen, Rentian Yao, Yun Yang, Jie Chen
Efficient Personalized Federated Learning via Sparse Model-Adaptation	Federated Learning (FL) aims to train machine learning models for multiple clients without sharing their own private data. Due to the heterogeneity of clients' local data distribution, recent studies explore the personalized FL that learns and deploys distinct local models with the help of auxiliary global models. However, the clients can be heterogeneous in terms of not only local data distribution, but also their computation and communication resources. The capacity and efficiency of personalized models are restricted by the lowest-resource clients, leading to sub-optimal performance and limited practicality of personalized FL. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach named pFedGate for efficient personalized FL by adaptively and efficiently learning sparse local models. With a lightweight trainable gating layer, pFedGate enables clients to reach their full potential in model capacity by generating different sparse models accounting for both the heterogeneous data distributions and resource constraints. Meanwhile, the computation and communication efficiency are both improved thanks to the adaptability between the model sparsity and clients' resources. Further, we theoretically show that the proposed pFedGate has superior complexity with guaranteed convergence and generalization error. Extensive experiments show that pFedGate achieves superior global accuracy, individual accuracy and efficiency simultaneously over state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate that pFedGate performs better than competitors in the novel clients participation and partial clients participation scenarios, and can learn meaningful sparse local models adapted to different data distributions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23aj	Daoyuan Chen, Liuyi Yao, Dawei Gao, Bolin Ding, Yaliang Li
Faster Gradient-Free Algorithms for Nonsmooth Nonconvex Stochastic Optimization	We consider the optimization problem of the form $\min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} f(x) \triangleq \mathbb{E}[F(x;\xi)]$ , where the component $F(x;\xi)$ is $L$-mean-squared Lipschitz but possibly nonconvex and nonsmooth.The recently proposed gradient-free method requires at most $\mathcal{O}( L^4 d^{3/2} \epsilon^{-4} + \Delta L^3 d^{3/2} \delta^{-1} \epsilon^{-4})$ stochastic zeroth-order oracle complexity to find a $(\delta,\epsilon)$-Goldstein stationary point of objective function, where $\Delta = f(x_0) - \inf_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} f(x)$ and $x_0$ is the initial point of the algorithm. This paper proposes a more efficient algorithm using stochastic recursive gradient estimators, which improves the complexity to $\mathcal{O}(L^3 d^{3/2} \epsilon^{-3}+ \Delta L^2 d^{3/2} \delta^{-1} \epsilon^{-3})$.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23ai	Lesi Chen, Jing Xu, Luo Luo
Learning to Incentivize Information Acquisition: Proper Scoring Rules Meet Principal-Agent Model	We study the incentivized information acquisition problem, where a principal hires an agent to gather information on her behalf. Such a problem is modeled as a Stackelberg game between the principal and the agent, where the principal announces a scoring rule that specifies the payment, and then the agent then chooses an effort level that maximizes her own profit and reports the information. We study the online setting of such a problem from the principal's perspective, i.e., designing the optimal scoring rule by repeatedly interacting with the strategic agent. We design a provably sample efficient algorithm that tailors the UCB algorithm (Auer et al., 2002) to our model, which achieves a $\mathcal{O} (K^2\cdot T^{2/3})$ regret after $T$ iterations, where $K$ is the number of effort levels of the agent. Our algorithm features a delicate estimation procedure for the optimal profit of the principal, and a conservative correction scheme that ensures the desired agent's actions are incentivized. Furthermore, a key feature of our regret bound is that it is independent of the number of states of the environment.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23ah	Siyu Chen, Jibang Wu, Yifan Wu, Zhuoran Yang
BEATs: Audio Pre-Training with Acoustic Tokenizers	We introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework BEATs for general audio representation pre-training, where we optimize an acoustic tokenizer and an audio SSL model by iterations. Unlike the previous audio SSL models that employ reconstruction loss for pre-training, our audio SSL model is trained with the discrete label prediction task, where the labels are generated by a semantic-rich acoustic tokenizer. We propose an iterative pipeline to jointly optimize the tokenizer and the pre-trained model, aiming to abstract high-level semantics and discard the redundant details for audio. The experimental results demonstrate our acoustic tokenizers can generate discrete labels with rich audio semantics and our audio SSL models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across various audio classification benchmarks, even outperforming previous models that use more training data and model parameters significantly. Specifically, we set a new SOTA mAP 50.6% on AudioSet-2M without using any external data, and 98.1% accuracy on ESC-50. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://aka.ms/beats.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23ag	Sanyuan Chen, Yu Wu, Chengyi Wang, Shujie Liu, Daniel Tompkins, Zhuo Chen, Wanxiang Che, Xiangzhan Yu, Furu Wei
Implicit Neural Spatial Representations for Time-dependent PDEs	Implicit Neural Spatial Representation (INSR) has emerged as an effective representation of spatially-dependent vector fields. This work explores solving time-dependent PDEs with INSR. Classical PDE solvers introduce both temporal and spatial discretizations. Common spatial discretizations include meshes and meshless point clouds, where each degree-of-freedom corresponds to a location in space. While these explicit spatial correspondences are intuitive to model and understand, these representations are not necessarily optimal for accuracy, memory usage, or adaptivity. Keeping the classical temporal discretization unchanged (e.g., explicit/implicit Euler), we explore INSR as an alternative spatial discretization, where spatial information is implicitly stored in the neural network weights. The network weights then evolve over time via time integration. Our approach does not require any training data generated by existing solvers because our approach is the solver itself. We validate our approach on various PDEs with examples involving large elastic deformations, turbulent fluids, and multi-scale phenomena. While slower to compute than traditional representations, our approach exhibits higher accuracy and lower memory consumption. Whereas classical solvers can dynamically adapt their spatial representation only by resorting to complex remeshing algorithms, our INSR approach is intrinsically adaptive. By tapping into the rich literature of classic time integrators, e.g., operator-splitting schemes, our method enables challenging simulations in contact mechanics and turbulent flows where previous neural-physics approaches struggle. Videos and codes are available on the project page: http://www.cs.columbia.edu/cg/INSR-PDE/	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23af	Honglin Chen, Rundi Wu, Eitan Grinspun, Changxi Zheng, Peter Yichen Chen

Semi-Offline Reinforcement Learning for Optimized Text Generation	Existing reinforcement learning (RL) mainly utilize online or offline settings. The online methods explore the environment with expensive time cost, and the offline methods efficiently obtain reward signals by sacrificing the exploration capability. We propose semi-offline RL, a novel paradigm that can smoothly transit from the offline setting to the online setting, balances the exploration capability and training cost, and provides a theoretical foundation for comparing different RL settings. Based on the semi-offline MDP formulation, we present the RL setting that is optimal in terms of optimization cost, asymptotic error, and overfitting error bound. Extensive experiments show that our semi-offline RL approach is effective in various text generation tasks and datasets, and yields comparable or usually better performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23ad	Changyu Chen, Xiting Wang, Yiqiao Jin, Victor Ye Dong, Li Dong, Jie Cao, Yi Liu, Rui Yan
Coordinated Dynamic Bidding in Repeated Second-Price Auctions with Budgets	In online ad markets, a rising number of advertisers are employing bidding agencies to participate in ad auctions. These agencies are specialized in designing online algorithms and bidding on behalf of their clients. Typically, an agency usually has information on multiple advertisers, so she can potentially coordinate bids to help her clients achieve higher utilities than those under independent bidding. In this paper, we study coordinated online bidding algorithms in repeated second-price auctions with budgets. We propose algorithms that guarantee every client a higher utility than the best she can get under independent bidding. We show that these algorithms achieve maximal social welfare and discuss bidders' incentives to misreport their budgets, in symmetric cases. Our proofs combine the techniques of online learning and equilibrium analysis, overcoming the difficulty of competing with a multi-dimensional benchmark. The performance of our algorithms is further evaluated by experiments on both synthetic and real data. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider bidder coordination in online repeated auctions with constraints.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23ac	Yurong Chen, Qian Wang, Zhijian Duan, Haoran Sun, Zhaohua Chen, Xiang Yan, Xiaotie Deng
Learning to Optimize Differentiable Games	"Many machine learning problems can be abstracted in solving game theory formulations and boil down to optimizing nested objectives, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and multi-agent reinforcement learning. Solving these games requires finding their stable fixed points or Nash equilibrium. However, existing algorithms for solving games suffer from empirical instability, hence demanding heavy ad-hoc tuning in practice. To tackle these challenges, we resort to the emerging scheme of Learning to Optimize (L2O), which discovers problem-specific efficient optimization algorithms through data-driven training. Our customized L2O framework for differentiable game theory problems, dubbed ""Learning to Play Games"" (L2PG), seeks a stable fixed point solution, by predicting the fast update direction from the past trajectory, with a novel gradient stability-aware, sign-based loss function. We further incorporate curriculum learning and self-learning to strengthen the empirical training stability and generalization of L2PG. On test problems including quadratic games and GANs, L2PG can substantially accelerate the convergence, and demonstrates a remarkably more stable trajectory. Codes are available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/L2PG."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23ab	Xuxi Chen, Nelson Vadori, Tianlong Chen, Zhangyang Wang
Optimistic Online Mirror Descent for Bridging Stochastic and Adversarial Online Convex Optimization	Stochastically Extended Adversarial (SEA) model is introduced by Sachs et al. (2022) as an interpolation between stochastic and adversarial online convex optimization. Under the smoothness condition, they demonstrate that the expected regret of optimistic follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) depends on the cumulative stochastic variance $\sigma_{1:T}^2$ and the cumulative adversarial variation $\Sigma_{1:T}^2$ for convex functions. They also provide a slightly weaker bound based on the maximal stochastic variance $\sigma_{\max}^2$ and the maximal adversarial variation $\Sigma_{\max}^2$ for strongly convex functions. Inspired by their work, we investigate the theoretical guarantees of optimistic online mirror descent (OMD) for the SEA model. For convex and smooth functions, we obtain the same $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\sigma_{1:T}^2}+\sqrt{\Sigma_{1:T}^2})$ regret bound, without the convexity requirement of individual functions. For strongly convex and smooth functions, we establish an $\mathcal{O}(\min\{\log (\sigma_{1:T}^2+\Sigma_{1:T}^2), (\sigma_{\max}^2 + \Sigma_{\max}^2) \log T\})$ bound, better than their $\mathcal{O}((\sigma_{\max}^2 + \Sigma_{\max}^2) \log T)$ result. For exp-concave and smooth functions, we achieve a new $\mathcal{O}(d\log(\sigma_{1:T}^2+\Sigma_{1:T}^2))$ bound. Owing to the OMD framework, we further establish dynamic regret for convex and smooth functions, which is more favorable in non-stationary online scenarios.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23aa	Sijia Chen, Wei-Wei Tu, Peng Zhao, Lijun Zhang
Layered State Discovery for Incremental Autonomous Exploration	We study the autonomous exploration (AX) problem proposed by Lim & Auer (2012). In this setting, the objective is to discover a set of $\epsilon$-optimal policies reaching a set $\mathcal{S}_L^{\rightarrow}$ of incrementally $L$-controllable states. We introduce a novel layered decomposition of the set of incrementally $L$-controllable states that is based on the iterative application of a state-expansion operator. We leverage these results to design Layered Autonomous Exploration (LAE), a novel algorithm for AX that attains a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(LS^{\rightarrow}_{L(1+\epsilon)}\Gamma_{L(1+\epsilon)} A \ln^{12}(S^{\rightarrow}_{L(1+\epsilon)})/\epsilon^2)$, where $S^{\rightarrow}_{L(1+\epsilon)}$ is the number of states that are incrementally $L(1+\epsilon)$-controllable, $A$ is the number of actions, and $\Gamma_{L(1+\epsilon)}$ is the branching factor of the transitions over such states. LAE improves over the algorithm of Tarbouriech et al. (2020a) by a factor of $L^2$ and it is the first algorithm for AX that works in a countably-infinite state space. Moreover, we show that, under a certain identifiability assumption, LAE achieves minimax-optimal sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(LS^{\rightarrow}_{L}A\ln^{12}(S^{\rightarrow}_{L})/\epsilon^2)$, outperforming existing algorithms and matching for the first time the lower bound proved by Cai et al. (2022) up to logarithmic factors.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23z	Liyu Chen, Andrea Tirinzoni, Alessandro Lazaric, Matteo Pirotta
Model Transferability with Responsive Decision Subjects	Given an algorithmic predictor that is accurate on some source population consisting of strategic human decision subjects, will it remain accurate if the population respond to it? In our setting, an agent or a user corresponds to a sample $(X,Y)$ drawn from a distribution $\cal{D}$ and will face a model $h$ and its classification result $h(X)$. Agents can modify $X$ to adapt to $h$, which will incur a distribution shift on $(X,Y)$. Our formulation is motivated by applications where the deployed machine learning models are subjected to human agents, and will ultimately face responsive and interactive data distributions. We formalize the discussions of the transferability of a model by studying how the performance of the model trained on the available source distribution (data) would translate to the performance on its induced domain. We provide both upper bounds for the performance gap due to the induced domain shift, as well as lower bounds for the trade-offs that a classifier has to suffer on either the source training distribution or the induced target distribution. We provide further instantiated analysis for two popular domain adaptation settings, including covariate shift and target shift.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23y	Yatong Chen, Zeyu Tang, Kun Zhang, Yang Liu
Multi-task Hierarchical Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning	Multi-task Imitation Learning (MIL) aims to train a policy capable of performing a distribution of tasks based on multi-task expert demonstrations, which is essential for general-purpose robots. Existing MIL algorithms suffer from low data efficiency and poor performance on complex long-horizontal tasks. We develop Multi-task Hierarchical Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MH-AIRL) to learn hierarchically-structured multi-task policies, which is more beneficial for compositional tasks with long horizons and has higher expert data efficiency through identifying and transferring reusable basic skills across tasks. To realize this, MH-AIRL effectively synthesizes context-based multi-task learning, AIRL (an IL approach), and hierarchical policy learning. Further, MH-AIRL can be adopted to demonstrations without the task or skill annotations (i.e., state-action pairs only) which are more accessible in practice. Theoretical justifications are provided for each module of MH-AIRL, and evaluations on challenging multi-task settings demonstrate superior performance and transferability of the multi-task policies learned with MH-AIRL as compared to SOTA MIL baselines.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23x	Jiayu Chen, Dipesh Tamboli, Tian Lan, Vaneet Aggarwal
Stratified Adversarial Robustness with Rejection	Recently, there is an emerging interest in adversarially training a classifier with a rejection option (also known as a selective classifier) for boosting adversarial robustness. While rejection can incur a cost in many applications, existing studies typically associate zero cost with rejecting perturbed inputs, which can result in the rejection of numerous slightly-perturbed inputs that could be correctly classified. In this work, we study adversarially-robust classification with rejection in the stratified rejection setting, where the rejection cost is modeled by rejection loss functions monotonically non-increasing in the perturbation magnitude. We theoretically analyze the stratified rejection setting and propose a novel defense method – Adversarial Training with Consistent Prediction-based Rejection (CPR) – for building a robust selective classifier. Experiments on image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods under strong adaptive attacks. For instance, on CIFAR-10, CPR reduces the total robust loss (for different rejection losses) by at least 7.3% under both seen and unseen attacks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23w	Jiefeng Chen, Jayaram Raghuram, Jihye Choi, Xi Wu, Yingyu Liang, Somesh Jha
Rethinking Visual Reconstruction: Experience-Based Content Completion Guided by Visual Cues	"Decoding seen images from brain activities has been an absorbing field. However, the reconstructed images still suffer from low quality with existing studies. This can be because our visual system is not like a camera that ""remembers"" every pixel. Instead, only part of the information can be perceived with our selective attention, and the brain ""guesses"" the rest to form what we think we see. Most existing approaches ignored the brain completion mechanism. In this work, we propose to reconstruct seen images with both the visual perception and the brain completion process, and design a simple, yet effective visual decoding framework to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first construct a shared discrete representation space for both brain signals and images. Then, a novel self-supervised token-to-token inpainting network is designed to implement visual content completion by building context and prior knowledge about the visual objects from the discrete latent space. Our approach improved the quality of visual reconstruction significantly and achieved state-of-the-art."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23v	Jiaxuan Chen, Yu Qi, Gang Pan
Fisher Information Embedding for Node and Graph Learning	"Attention-based graph neural networks (GNNs), such as graph attention networks (GATs), have become popular neural architectures for processing graph-structured data and learning node embeddings. Despite their empirical success, these models rely on labeled data and the theoretical properties of these models have yet to be fully understood. In this work, we propose a novel attention-based node embedding framework for graphs. Our framework builds upon a hierarchical kernel for multisets of subgraphs around nodes (e.g. neighborhoods) and each kernel leverages the geometry of a smooth statistical manifold to compare pairs of multisets, by ""projecting"" the multisets onto the manifold. By explicitly computing node embeddings with a manifold of Gaussian mixtures, our method leads to a new attention mechanism for neighborhood aggregation. We provide theoretical insights into generalizability and expressivity of our embeddings, contributing to a deeper understanding of attention-based GNNs. We propose both efficient unsupervised and supervised methods for learning the embeddings. Through experiments on several node classification benchmarks, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing attention-based graph models like GATs.

Generalized Implicit Follow-The-Regularized-Leader	We propose a new class of online learning algorithms, generalized implicit Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (FTRL), that expands the scope of FTRL framework. Generalized implicit FTRL can recover known algorithms, such as FTRL with linearized losses and implicit FTRL, and it allows the design of new update rules, as extensions of aProx and Mirror-Prox to FTRL. Our theory is constructive in the sense that it provides a simple unifying framework to design updates that directly improve the worst-case upper bound on the regret. The key idea is substituting the linearization of the losses with a Fenchel-Young inequality. We show the flexibility of the framework by proving that some known algorithms, like the Mirror-Prox updates, are instantiations of the generalized implicit FTRL. Finally, the new framework allows us to recover the temporal variation bound of implicit OMD, with the same computational complexity.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23t	Keyi Chen, Francesco Orabona
HarsanyiNet: Computing Accurate Shapley Values in a Single Forward Propagation	The Shapley value is widely regarded as a trustworthy attribution metric. However, when people use Shapley values to explain the attribution of input variables of a deep neural network (DNN), it usually requires a very high computational cost to approximate relatively accurate Shapley values in real-world applications. Therefore, we propose a novel network architecture, the HarsanyiNet, which makes inferences on the input sample and simultaneously computes the exact Shapley values of the input variables in a single forward propagation. The HarsanyiNet is designed on the theoretical foundation that the Shapley value can be reformulated as the redistribution of Harsanyi interactions encoded by the network.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23s	Lu Chen, Siyu Lou, Keyan Zhang, Jin Huang, Quanshi Zhang
Bidirectional Looking with A Novel Double Exponential Moving Average to Adaptive and Non-adaptive Momentum Optimizers	Optimizer is an essential component for the success of deep learning, which guides the neural network to update the parameters according to the loss on the training set. SGD and Adam are two classical and effective optimizers on which researchers have proposed many variants, such as SGDM and RAdam. In this paper, we innovatively combine the backward-looking and forward-looking aspects of the optimizer algorithm and propose a novel Admeta (	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23r	Yineng Chen, Zuchao Li, Lefei Zhang, Bo Du, Hai Zhao
Improved Analysis of Score-based Generative Modeling: User-Friendly Bounds under Minimal Smoothness Assumptions	We give an improved theoretical analysis of score-based generative modeling. Under a score estimate with small $L^2$ error (averaged across timesteps), we provide efficient convergence guarantees for any data distribution with second-order moment, by either employing early stopping or assuming smoothness condition on the score function of the data distribution. Our result does not rely on any log-concavity or functional inequality assumption and has a logarithmic dependence on the smoothness. In particular, we show that under only a finite second moment condition, approximating the following in reverse KL divergence in $\epsilon$-accuracy can be done in $\tilde O\left(\frac{d \log (1/\delta)}{\epsilon}\right)$ steps: 1) the variance-$\delta$ Gaussian perturbation of any data distribution; 2) data distributions with $1/\delta$-smooth score functions. Our analysis also provides a quantitative comparison between different discrete approximations and may guide the choice of discretization points in practice.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23q	Hongrui Chen, Holden Lee, Jianfeng Lu
Sample Complexity of Probability Divergences under Group Symmetry	We rigorously quantify the improvement in the sample complexity of variational divergence estimations for group-invariant distributions. In the cases of the Wasserstein-1 metric and the Lipschitz-regularized $\alpha$-divergences, the reduction of sample complexity is proportional to an ambient-dimension-dependent power of the group size. For the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), the improvement of sample complexity is more nuanced, as it depends on not only the group size but also the choice of kernel. Numerical simulations verify our theories.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23p	Ziyu Chen, Markos Katsoulakis, Luc Rey-Bellet, Wei Zhu
Score Approximation, Estimation and Distribution Recovery of Diffusion Models on Low-Dimensional Data	Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art performance in various generation tasks. However, their theoretical foundations fall far behind. This paper studies score approximation, estimation, and distribution recovery of diffusion models, when data are supported on an unknown low-dimensional linear subspace. Our result provides sample complexity bounds for distribution estimation using diffusion models. We show that with a properly chosen neural network architecture, the score function can be both accurately approximated and efficiently estimated. Further, the generated distribution based on the estimated score function captures the data geometric structures and converges to a close vicinity of the data distribution. The convergence rate depends on subspace dimension, implying that diffusion models can circumvent the curse of data ambient dimensionality.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23o	Minshuo Chen, Kaixuan Huang, Tuo Zhao, Mengdi Wang
Decentralized Stochastic Bilevel Optimization with Improved per-Iteration Complexity	Bilevel optimization recently has received tremendous attention due to its great success in solving important machine learning problems like meta learning, reinforcement learning, and hyperparameter optimization. Extending single-agent training on bilevel problems to the decentralized setting is a natural generalization, and there has been a flurry of work studying decentralized bilevel optimization algorithms. However, it remains unknown how to design the distributed algorithm with sample complexity and convergence rate comparable to SGD for stochastic optimization, and at the same time without directly computing the exact Hessian or Jacobian matrices. In this paper we propose such an algorithm. More specifically, we propose a novel decentralized stochastic bilevel optimization (DSBO) algorithm that only requires first order stochastic oracle, Hessian-vector product and Jacobian-vector product oracle. The sample complexity of our algorithm matches the currently best known results for DSBO, while our algorithm does not require estimating the full Hessian and Jacobian matrices, thereby possessing to improved per-iteration complexity.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23n	Xuxing Chen, Minhui Huang, Shiqian Ma, Krishna Balasubramanian
Explore and Exploit the Diverse Knowledge in Model Zoo for Domain Generalization	The proliferation of pretrained models, as a result of advancements in pretraining techniques, has led to the emergence of a vast zoo of publicly available models. Effectively utilizing these resources to obtain models with robust out-of-distribution generalization capabilities for downstream tasks has become a crucial area of research. Previous research has primarily focused on identifying the most powerful models within the model zoo, neglecting to fully leverage the diverse inductive biases contained within. This paper argues that the knowledge contained in weaker models is valuable and presents a method for leveraging the diversity within the model zoo to improve out-of-distribution generalization capabilities. Specifically, we investigate the behaviors of various pretrained models across different domains of downstream tasks by characterizing the variations in their encoded representations in terms of two dimensions: diversity shift and correlation shift. This characterization enables us to propose a new algorithm for integrating diverse pretrained models, not limited to the strongest models, in order to achieve enhanced out-of-distribution generalization performance. Our proposed method demonstrates state-of-the-art empirical results on a variety of datasets, thus validating the benefits of utilizing diverse knowledge.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23m	Yimeng Chen, Tianyang Hu, Fengwei Zhou, Zhenguo Li, Zhi-Ming Ma
Evolving Semantic Prototype Improves Generative Zero-Shot Learning	In zero-shot learning (ZSL), generative methods synthesize class-related sample features based on predefined semantic prototypes. They advance the ZSL performance by synthesizing unseen class sample features for better training the classifier. We observe that each class's predefined semantic prototype (also referred to as semantic embedding or condition) does not accurately match its real semantic prototype. So the synthesized visual sample features do not faithfully represent the real sample features, limiting the classifier training and existing ZSL performance. In this paper, we formulate this mismatch phenomenon as the visual-semantic domain shift problem. We propose a dynamic semantic prototype evolving (DSP) method to align the empirically predefined semantic prototypes and the real prototypes for class-related feature synthesis. The alignment is learned by refining sample features and semantic prototypes in a unified framework and making the synthesized visual sample features approach real sample features. After alignment, synthesized sample features from unseen classes are closer to the real sample features and benefit DSP to improve existing generative ZSL methods by 8.5%, 8.0%, and 9.7% on the standard CUB, SUN AWA2 datasets, the significant performance improvement indicates that evolving semantic prototype explores a virgin field in ZSL.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23l	Shiming Chen, Wenjin Hou, Ziming Hong, Xiaohan Ding, Yibing Song, Xinge You, Tongliang Liu, Kun Zhang
Efficient and Degree-Guided Graph Generation via Discrete Diffusion Modeling	Diffusion-based generative graph models have been proven effective in generating high-quality small graphs. However, they need to be more scalable for generating large graphs containing thousands of nodes desiring graph statistics. In this work, we propose EDGE, a new diffusion-based generative graph model that addresses generative tasks with large graphs. To improve computation efficiency, we encourage graph sparsity by using a discrete diffusion process that randomly removes edges at each time step and finally obtains an empty graph. EDGE only focuses on a portion of nodes in the graph at each denoising step. It makes much fewer edge predictions than previous diffusion-based models. Moreover, EDGE admits explicitly modeling the node degrees of the graphs, further improving the model performance. The empirical study shows that EDGE is much more efficient than competing methods and can generate large graphs with thousands of nodes. It also outperforms baseline models in generation quality: graphs generated by our approach have more similar graph statistics to those of the training graphs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23k	Xiaohui Chen, Jiaxing He, Xu Han, Liping Liu
GuardHFL: Privacy Guardian for Heterogeneous Federated Learning	Heterogeneous federated learning (HFL) enables clients with different computation and communication capabilities to collaboratively train their own customized models via a query-response paradigm on auxiliary datasets. However, such a paradigm raises serious privacy concerns due to the leakage of highly sensitive query samples and response predictions. We put forth GuardHFL, the first-of-its-kind efficient and privacy-preserving HFL framework. GuardHFL is equipped with a novel HFL-friendly secure querying scheme built on lightweight secret sharing and symmetric-key techniques. The core of GuardHFL is two customized multiplication and comparison protocols, which substantially boost the execution efficiency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GuardHFL significantly outperforms the alternative instantiations based on existing state-of-the-art techniques in both runtime and communication cost.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23j	Hanxiao Chen, Meng Hao, Hongwei Li, Kangjie Chen, Guowen Xu, Tianwei Zhang, Xilin Zhang
Subequivariant Graph Reinforcement Learning in 3D Environments	Learning a shared policy that guides the locomotion of different agents is of core interest in Reinforcement Learning (RL), which leads to the study of morphology-agnostic RL. However, existing benchmarks are highly restrictive in the choice of starting point and target point, constraining the movement of the agents within 2D space. In this work, we propose a novel setup for morphology-agnostic RL, dubbed Subequivariant Graph RL in 3D environments (3D-SGRL). Specifically, we first introduce a new set of more practical yet challenging benchmarks in 3D space that allows the agent to have full Degree-of-Freedoms to explore in arbitrary directions starting from arbitrary configurations. Moreover, to optimize the policy over the enlarged state-action space, we propose to inject geometric symmetry, i.e., subequivariance, into the modeling of the policy and Q-function such that the policy can generalize to all directions, improving exploration efficiency. This goal is achieved by a novel SubEquivariant Transformer (SET) that permits expressive message exchange. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on the proposed benchmarks, where our method consistently and significantly outperforms existing approaches on single-task, multi-task, and zero-shot generalization scenarios. Extensive ablations are also conducted to verify our design.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23i	Runfa Chen, Jiaqi Han, Fuchun Sun, Wenbing Huang
Is Learning Summary Statistics Necessary for Likelihood-free Inference?	Likelihood-free inference (LFI) is a set of techniques for inference in implicit statistical models. A longstanding question in LFI has been how to design or learn good summary statistics of data, but this might now seem unnecessary due to the advent of recent end-to-end (i.e. neural network-based) LFI methods. In this work, we rethink this question with a new method for learning summary statistics. We show that learning sufficient statistics may be easier than direct posterior inference, as the former problem can be reduced to a set of low-dimensional, easy-to-solve learning problems. This suggests us to explicitly decouple summary statistics learning from posterior inference in LFI. Experiments on diverse inference tasks with different data types validate our hypothesis.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23h	Yanzhi Chen, Michael U. Gutmann, Adrian Weller
ED-Batch: Efficient Automatic Batching of Dynamic Neural Networks via Learned Finite State Machines	Batching has a fundamental influence on the efficiency of deep neural network (DNN) execution. However, for dynamic DNNs, efficient batching is particularly challenging as the dataflow graph varies per input instance. As a result, state-of-the-art frameworks use heuristics that result in suboptimal batching decisions. Further, batching puts strict restrictions on memory adjacency and can lead to high data movement costs. In this paper, we provide an approach for batching dynamic DNNs based on finite state machines, which enables the automatic discovery of batching policies specialized for each DNN via reinforcement learning. Moreover, we find that memory planning that is aware of the batching policy can save significant data movement overheads, which is automated by a PQ tree-based algorithm we introduce. Experimental results show that our framework speeds up state-of-the-art frameworks by on average 1.15x, 1.39x, and 2.45x for chain-based, tree-based, and lattice-based DNNs across CPU and GPU. The framework is open-sourced at https://github.com/gulang2019/ED-Batch.git.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23g	Siyuan Chen, Pratik Pramod Fegade, Tianqi Chen, Phillip Gibbons, Todd Mowry
Provably Convergent Schrödinger Bridge with Applications to Probabilistic Time Series Imputation	The Schrödinger bridge problem (SBP) is gaining increasing attention in generative modeling and showing promising potential even in comparison with the score-based generative models (SGMs). SBP can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized optimal transport problem, which conducts projections onto every other marginal alternatingly. However, in practice, only approximated projections are accessible and their convergence is not well understood. To fill this gap, we present a first convergence analysis of the Schrödinger bridge algorithm based on approximated projections. As for its practical applications, we apply SBP to probabilistic time series imputation by generating missing values conditioned on observed data. We show that optimizing the transport cost improves the performance and the proposed algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art result in healthcare and environmental data while exhibiting the advantage of exploring both temporal and feature patterns in probabilistic time series imputation.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23f	Yu Chen, Wei Deng, Shikai Fang, Fengpei Li, Nicole Tianjiao Yang, Yikai Zhang, Kashif Rasul, Shandian Zhe, Anderson Schneider, Yuriy Nevmyvaka
Restoration-Degradation Beyond Linear Diffusions: A Non-Asymptotic Analysis For DDIM-type Samplers	We develop a framework for non-asymptotic analysis of deterministic samplers used for diffusion generative modeling. Several recent works have analyzed stochastic samplers using tools like Girsanov's theorem and a chain rule variant of the interpolation argument. Unfortunately, these techniques give vacuous bounds when applied to deterministic samplers. We give a new operational interpretation for deterministic sampling by showing that one step along the probability flow ODE can be expressed as two steps: 1) a restoration step that runs gradient ascent on the conditional log-likelihood at some infinitesimally previous time, and 2) a degradation step that runs the forward process using noise pointing back towards the current iterate. This perspective allows us to extend denoising diffusion implicit models to general, non-linear forward processes. We then develop the first polynomial convergence bounds for these samplers under mild conditions on the data distribution.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23e	Sitan Chen, Giannis Daras, Alex Dimakis
Differentially Private Stochastic Convex Optimization under a Quantile Loss Function	We study $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differentially private (DP) stochastic convex optimization under an $r$-th quantile loss function taking the form $c(u) = ru^+ + (1-r)(-u)^+$. The function is non-smooth, and we propose to approximate it with a smooth function obtained by convolution smoothing, which enjoys both structure and bandwidth flexibility and can address outliers. This leads to a better approximation than those obtained from existing methods such as Moreau Envelope. We then design private algorithms based on DP stochastic gradient descent and objective perturbation, and show that both algorithms achieve (near) optimal excess generalization risk $O(\max\{\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}, \frac{\sqrt{d\ln(1/\delta)}}{n\varepsilon}\})$. Through objective perturbation, we further derive an upper bound $O(\max\{\sqrt{\frac{d}{n}}, \sqrt{\frac{d\ln(1/\delta)}{n\varepsilon}}\})$ on the parameter estimation error under mild assumptions on data generating processes. Some applications in private quantile regression and private inventory control will be discussed.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23d	Du Chen, Geoffrey A. Chua
Trompt: Towards a Better Deep Neural Network for Tabular Data	Tabular data is arguably one of the most commonly used data structures in various practical domains, including finance, healthcare and e-commerce. The inherent heterogeneity allows tabular data to store rich information. However, based on a recently published tabular benchmark, we can see deep neural networks still fall behind tree-based models on tabular datasets. In this paper, we propose Trompt–which stands for Tabular Prompt–a novel architecture inspired by prompt learning of language models. The essence of prompt learning is to adjust a large pre-trained model through a set of prompts outside the model without directly modifying the model. Based on this idea, Trompt separates the learning strategy of tabular data into two parts. The first part, analogous to pre-trained models, focus on learning the intrinsic information of a table. The second part, analogous to prompts, focus on learning the variations among samples. Trompt is evaluated with the benchmark mentioned above. The experimental results demonstrate that Trompt outperforms state-of-the-art deep neural networks and is comparable to tree-based models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23c	Kuan-Yu Chen, Ping-Han Chiang, Hsin-Rung Chou, Ting-Wei Chen, Tien-Hao Chang
Beyond the Edge of Stability via Two-step Gradient Updates	"Gradient Descent (GD) is a powerful workhorse of modern machine learning thanks to its scalability and efficiency in high-dimensional spaces. Its ability to find local minimisers is only guaranteed for losses with Lipschitz gradients, where it can be seen as a 'bona-fide' discretisation of an underlying gradient flow. Yet, many ML setups involving overparametrised models do not fall into this problem class, which has motivated research beyond the so-called ""Edge of Stability"" (EoS), where the step-size crosses the admissibility threshold inversely proportional to the Lipschitz constant above. Perhaps surprisingly, GD has been empirically observed to still converge regardless of local instability and oscillatory behavior. The incipient theoretical analysis of this phenomena has mainly focused in the overparametrised regime, where the effect of choosing a large learning rate may be associated to a 'Sharpness-Minimisation' implicit regularisation within the manifold of minimisers, under appropriate asymptotic limits. In contrast, in this work we directly examine the conditions for such unstable convergence, focusing on simple, yet representative, learning problems, via analysis of two-step gradient updates. Specifically, we characterize a local condition involving third-order derivatives that guarantees existence and convergence to fixed points of the two-step updates, and leverage such property in a teacher-student setting, under population loss. Finally, starting from Matrix Factorization, we provide observations of period-2 orbit of GD in high-dimensional settings with intuition of its dynamics, along with exploration into more general settings."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23b	Lei Chen, Joan Bruna
Multi-Layer Neural Networks as Trainable Ladders of Hilbert Spaces	To characterize the functions spaces explored by multi-layer neural networks (NNs), we introduce Neural Hilbert Ladders (NHLs), a collection of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSes) that are defined iteratively and adaptive to training. First, we prove a correspondence between functions expressed by L-layer NNs and those belonging to L-level NHLs. Second, we prove generalization guarantees for learning the NHL based on a new complexity measure. Third, corresponding to the training of multi-layer NNs in the infinite-width mean-field limit, we derive an evolution of the NHL characterized by the dynamics of multiple random fields. Finally, we examine linear and shallow NNs from the new perspective and complement the theory with numerical results.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23a	Zhengdao Chen
On the Statistical Benefits of Temporal Difference Learning	Given a dataset on actions and resulting long-term rewards, a direct estimation approach fits value functions that minimize prediction error on the training data. Temporal difference learning (TD) methods instead fit value functions by minimizing the degree of temporal inconsistency between estimates made at successive time-steps. Focusing on finite state Markov chains, we provide a crisp asymptotic theory of the statistical advantages of this approach. First, we show that an intuitive inverse trajectory pooling coefficient completely characterizes the percent reduction in mean-squared error of value estimates. Depending on problem structure, the reduction could be enormous or nonexistent. Next, we prove that there can be dramatic improvements in estimates of the difference in value-to-go for two states: TD's errors are bounded in terms of a novel measure – the problem's trajectory crossing time – which can be much smaller than the problem's time horizon.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cheikhi23a	David Cheikhi, Daniel Russo
Fast Federated Machine Unlearning with Nonlinear Functional Theory	Federated machine unlearning (FMU) aims to remove the influence of a specified subset of training data upon request from a trained federated learning model. Despite achieving remarkable performance, existing FMU techniques suffer from inefficiency due to two sequential operations of training and retraining/unlearning on large-scale datasets. Our prior study, PCMU, was proposed to improve the efficiency of centralized machine unlearning (CMU) with certified guarantees, by simultaneously executing the training and unlearning operations. This paper proposes a fast FMU algorithm, FFMU, for improving the FMU efficiency while maintaining the unlearning quality. The PCMU method is leveraged to train a local machine learning (MU) model on each edge device. We propose to employ nonlinear functional analysis techniques to refine the local MU models as output functions of a Nemytskii operator. We conduct theoretical analysis to derive that the Nemytskii operator has a global Lipschitz constant, which allows us to bound the difference between two MU models regarding the distance between their gradients. Based on the Nemytskii operator and average smooth local gradients, the global MU model on the server is guaranteed to achieve close performance to each local MU model with the certified guarantees.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/che23b	Tianshi Che, Yang Zhou, Zijie Zhang, Lingjuan Lyu, Ji Liu, Da Yan, Dejing Dou, Jun Huan

Collaborative Multi-Agent Heterogeneous Multi-Armed Bandits	The study of collaborative multi-agent bandits has attracted significant attention recently. In light of this, we initiate the study of a new collaborative setting, consisting of $N$ agents such that each agent is learning one of $M$ stochastic multi-armed bandits to minimize their group cumulative regret. We develop decentralized algorithms which facilitate collaboration between the agents under two scenarios. We characterize the performance of these algorithms by deriving the per agent cumulative regret and group regret upper bounds. We also prove lower bounds for the group regret in this setting, which demonstrates the near-optimal behavior of the proposed algorithms.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chawla23a	Ronshee Chawla, Daniel Vial, Sanjay Shakkottai, R.

Why does Throwing Away Data Improve Worst-Group Error?	When facing data with imbalanced classes or groups, practitioners follow an intriguing strategy to achieve best results. They throw away examples until the classes or groups are balanced in size, and then perform empirical risk minimization on the reduced training set. This opposes common wisdom in learning theory, where the expected error is supposed to decrease as the dataset grows in size. In this work, we leverage extreme value theory to address this apparent contradiction. Our results show that the tails of the data distribution play an important role in determining the worst-group-accuracy of linear classifiers. When learning on data with heavy tails, throwing away data restores the geometric symmetry of the resulting classifier, and therefore improves its worst-group generalization.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chaudhuri23a	Kamalika Chaudhuri, Kartik Ahuja, Martin Arjovsky, David Lopez-Paz
Streaming Submodular Maximization with Differential Privacy	In this work, we study the problem of privately maximizing a submodular function in the streaming setting. Extensive work has been done on privately maximizing submodular functions in the general case when the function depends upon the private data of individuals. However, when the size of the data stream drawn from the domain of the objective function is large or arrives very fast, one must privately optimize the objective within the constraints of the streaming setting. We establish fundamental differentially private baselines for this problem and then derive better trade-offs between privacy and utility for the special case of decomposable submodular functions. A submodular function is decomposable when it can be written as a sum of submodular functions; this structure arises naturally when each summand function models the utility of an individual and the goal is to study the total utility of the whole population as in the well-known Combinatorial Public Projects Problem. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis with experimental corroboration.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chaturvedi23a	Anamay Chaturvedi, Huy Nguyen, Thy Dinh Nguyen

On Investigating the Conservative Property of Score-Based Generative Models	Existing Score-Based Models (SBMs) can be categorized into constrained SBMs (CSBMs) or unconstrained SBMs (USBMs) according to their parameterization approaches. CSBMs model probability density functions as Boltzmann distributions, and assign their predictions as the negative gradients of some scalar-valued energy functions. On the other hand, USBMs employ flexible architectures capable of directly estimating scores without the need to explicitly model energy functions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the architectural constraints of CSBMs may limit their modeling ability. In addition, we show that USBMs' inability to preserve the property of conservativeness may lead to degraded performance in practice. To address the above issues, we propose Quasi-Conservative Score-Based Models (QCSBMs) for keeping the advantages of both CSBMs and USBMs. Our theoretical derivations demonstrate that the training objective of QCSBMs can be efficiently integrated into the training processes by leveraging the Hutchinson's trace estimator. In addition, our experimental results on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and SVHN datasets validate the effectiveness of QCSBMs. Finally, we justify the advantage of QCSBMs using an example of a one-layered autoencoder.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chao23a	Chen-Hao Chao, Wei-Fang Sun, Bo-Wun Cheng, Chun-Yi Lee
Muse: Text-To-Image Generation via Masked Generative Transformers	We present Muse, a text-to-image Transformermodel that achieves state-of-the-art image genera-tion performance while being significantly moreefficient than diffusion or autoregressive models.Muse is trained on a masked modeling task indiscrete token space: given the text embeddingextracted from a pre-trained large language model(LLM), Muse learns to predict randomly maskedimage tokens. Compared to pixel-space diffusionmodels, such as Imagen and DALL-E 2, Muse issignificantly more efficient due to the use of dis-crete tokens and requires fewer sampling itera-tions; compared to autoregressive models such asParti, Muse is more efficient due to the use of par-allel decoding. The use of a pre-trained LLM en-ables fine-grained language understanding, whichtranslates to high-fidelity image generation andthe understanding of visual concepts such as ob-jects, their spatial relationships, pose, cardinalityetc. Our 900M parameter model achieves a newSOTA on CC3M, with an FID score of 6.06. TheMuse 3B parameter model achieves an FID of7.88 on zero-shot COCO evaluation, along with aCLIP score of 0.32.

Memory-Based Dual Gaussian Processes for Sequential Learning	Sequential learning with Gaussian processes (GPs) is challenging when access to past data is limited, for example, in continual and active learning. In such cases, errors can accumulate over time due to inaccuracies in the posterior, hyperparameters, and inducing points, making accurate learning challenging. Here, we present a method to keep all such errors in check using the recently proposed dual sparse variational GP. Our method enables accurate inference for generic likelihoods and improves learning by actively building and updating a memory of past data. We demonstrate its effectiveness in several applications involving Bayesian optimization, active learning, and continual learning.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chang23a	Paul Edmund Chang, Prakhar Verma, S.

Representations and Exploration for Deep Reinforcement Learning using Singular Value Decomposition	Representation learning and exploration are among the key challenges for any deep reinforcement learning agent. In this work, we provide a singular value decomposition based method that can be used to obtain representations that preserve the underlying transition structure in the domain. Perhaps interestingly, we show that these representations also capture the relative frequency of state visitations, thereby providing an estimate for pseudo-counts for free. To scale this decomposition method to large-scale domains, we provide an algorithm that never requires building the transition matrix, can make use of deep networks, and also permits mini-batch training. Further, we draw inspiration from predictive state representations and extend our decomposition method to partially observable environments. With experiments on multi-task settings with partially observable domains, we show that the proposed method can not only learn useful representation on DM-Lab-30 environments (that have inputs involving language instructions, pixel images, rewards, among others) but it can also be effective at hard exploration tasks in DM-Hard-8 environments.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chandak23a	Yash Chandak, Shantanu Thakoor, Zhaohan Daniel Guo, Yunhao Tang, Remi Munos, Will Dabney, Diana L Borsa
Thompson Sampling for High-Dimensional Sparse Linear Contextual Bandits	We consider the stochastic linear contextual bandit problem with high-dimensional features. We analyze the Thompson sampling algorithm using special classes of sparsity-inducing priors (e.g., spike-and-slab) to model the unknown parameter and provide a nearly optimal upper bound on the expected cumulative regret. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides theoretical guarantees of Thompson sampling in high-dimensional and sparse contextual bandits. For faster computation, we use variational inference instead of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to approximate the posterior distribution. Extensive simulations demonstrate the improved performance of our proposed algorithm over existing ones.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chakraborty23b	Sunrit Chakraborty, Saptarshi Roy, Ambuj Tewari
STEERING : Stein Information Directed Exploration for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning	Directed Exploration is a crucial challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), especially when rewards are sparse. Information-directed sampling (IDS), which optimizes the information ratio, seeks to do so by augmenting regret with information gain. However, estimating information gain is computationally intractable or relies on restrictive assumptions which prohibit its use in many practical instances. In this work, we posit an alternative exploration incentive in terms of the integral probability metric (IPM) between a current estimate of the transition model and the unknown optimal, which under suitable conditions, can be computed in closed form with the kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD). Based on KSD, we develop a novel algorithm STEERING: STEin information dirEcted exploration for model-based Reinforcement LearnING. To enable its derivation, we develop fundamentally new variants of KSD for discrete conditional distributions. We further establish that STEERING archives sublinear Bayesian regret, improving upon prior learning rates of information-augmented MBRL, IDS included. Experimentally, we show that the proposed algorithm is computationally affordable and outperforms several prior approaches.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chakraborty23a	Souradip Chakraborty, Amrit Bedi, Alec Koppel, Mengdi Wang, Furong Huang, Dinesh Manocha
Orthogonality-Enforced Latent Space in Autoencoders: An Approach to Learning Disentangled Representations	Noting the importance of factorizing (or disentangling) the latent space, we propose a novel, non-probabilistic disentangling framework for autoencoders, based on the principles of symmetry transformations that are independent of one another. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deterministic model that is aiming to achieve disentanglement based on autoencoders using only a reconstruction loss without pairs of images or labels, by explicitly introducing inductive biases into a model architecture through Euler encoding. The proposed model is then compared with a number of state-of-the-art models, relevant to disentanglement, including symmetry-based models and generative models. Our evaluation using six different disentanglement metrics, including the unsupervised disentanglement metric we propose here in this paper, shows that the proposed model can offer better disentanglement, especially when variances of the features are different, where other methods may struggle. We believe that this model opens several opportunities for linear disentangled representation learning based on deterministic autoencoders.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cha23b	Jaehoon Cha, Jeyan Thiyagalingam
Tighter Lower Bounds for Shuffling SGD: Random Permutations and Beyond	We study convergence lower bounds of without-replacement stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for solving smooth (strongly-)convex finite-sum minimization problems. Unlike most existing results focusing on final iterate lower bounds in terms of the number of components $n$ and the number of epochs $K$, we seek bounds for arbitrary weighted average iterates that are tight in all factors including the condition number $\kappa$. For SGD with Random Reshuffling, we present lower bounds that have tighter $\kappa$ dependencies than existing bounds. Our results are the first to perfectly close the gap between lower and upper bounds for weighted average iterates in both strongly-convex and convex cases. We also prove weighted average iterate lower bounds for arbitrary permutation-based SGD, which apply to all variants that carefully choose the best permutation. Our bounds improve the existing bounds in factors of $n$ and $\kappa$ and thereby match the upper bounds shown for a recently proposed algorithm called GraB.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cha23a	Jaeyoung Cha, Jaewook Lee, Chulhee Yun
Learning Globally Smooth Functions on Manifolds	Smoothness and low dimensional structures play central roles in improving generalization and stability in learning and statistics. This work combines techniques from semi-infinite constrained learning and manifold regularization to learn representations that are globally smooth on a manifold. To do so, it shows that under typical conditions the problem of learning a Lipschitz continuous function on a manifold is equivalent to a dynamically weighted manifold regularization problem. This observation leads to a practical algorithm based on a weighted Laplacian penalty whose weights are adapted using stochastic gradient techniques. It is shown that under mild conditions, this method estimates the Lipschitz constant of the solution, learning a globally smooth solution as a byproduct. Experiments on real world data illustrate the advantages of the proposed method relative to existing alternatives. Our code is available at https://github.com/JuanCervino/smoothbench.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cervino23a	Juan Cervino, Luiz F. O.

On the Robustness of Text Vectorizers	A fundamental issue in machine learning is the robustness of the model with respect to changes in the input. In natural language processing, models typically contain a first embedding layer, transforming a sequence of tokens into vector representations. While the robustness with respect to changes of continuous inputs is well-understood, the situation is less clear when considering discrete changes, for instance replacing a word by another in an input sentence. Our work formally proves that popular embedding schemes, such as concatenation, TF-IDF, and Paragraph Vector (a.k.a. doc2vec), exhibit robustness in the Hölder or Lipschitz sense with respect to the Hamming distance. We provide quantitative bounds for these schemes and demonstrate how the constants involved are affected by the length of the document. These findings are exemplified through a series of numerical examples.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/catellier23a	Rémi Catellier, Samuel Vaiter, Damien Garreau
LESS-VFL: Communication-Efficient Feature Selection for Vertical Federated Learning	We propose LESS-VFL, a communication-efficient feature selection method for distributed systems with vertically partitioned data. We consider a system of a server and several parties with local datasets that share a sample ID space but have different feature sets. The parties wish to collaboratively train a model for a prediction task. As part of the training, the parties wish to remove unimportant features in the system to improve generalization, efficiency, and explainability. In LESS-VFL, after a short pre-training period, the server optimizes its part of the global model to determine the relevant outputs from party models. This information is shared with the parties to then allow local feature selection without communication. We analytically prove that LESS-VFL removes spurious features from model training. We provide extensive empirical evidence that LESS-VFL can achieve high accuracy and remove spurious features at a fraction of the communication cost of other feature selection approaches.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/castiglia23a	Timothy Castiglia, Yi Zhou, Shiqiang Wang, Swanand Kadhe, Nathalie Baracaldo, Stacy Patterson
Scalable Safe Policy Improvement via Monte Carlo Tree Search	Algorithms for safely improving policies are important to deploy reinforcement learning approaches in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose an algorithm, called MCTS-SPIBB, that computes safe policy improvement online using a Monte Carlo Tree Search based strategy. We theoretically prove that the policy generated by MCTS-SPIBB converges, as the number of simulations grows, to the optimal safely improved policy generated by Safe Policy Improvement with Baseline Bootstrapping (SPIBB), a popular algorithm based on policy iteration. Moreover, our empirical analysis performed on three standard benchmark domains shows that MCTS-SPIBB scales to significantly larger problems than SPIBB because it computes the policy online and locally, i.e., only in the states actually visited by the agent.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/castellini23a	Alberto Castellini, Federico Bianchi, Edoardo Zorzi, Thiago D.

Stein Variational Goal Generation for adaptive Exploration in Multi-Goal Reinforcement Learning	In multi-goal Reinforcement Learning, an agent can share experience between related training tasks, resulting in better generalization for new tasks at test time. However, when the goal space has discontinuities and the reward is sparse, a majority of goals are difficult to reach. In this context, a curriculum over goals helps agents learn by adapting training tasks to their current capabilities. In this work, we propose Stein Variational Goal Generation (SVGG), which samples goals of intermediate difficulty for the agent, by leveraging a learned predictive model of its goal reaching capabilities. The distribution of goals is modeled with particles that are attracted in areas of appropriate difficulty using Stein Variational Gradient Descent. We show that SVGG outperforms state-of-the-art multi-goal Reinforcement Learning methods in terms of success coverage in hard exploration problems, and demonstrate that it is endowed with a useful recovery property when the environment changes.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/castanet23a	Nicolas Castanet, Olivier Sigaud, Sylvain Lamprier
Grounding Large Language Models in Interactive Environments with Online Reinforcement Learning	Recent works successfully leveraged Large Language Models' (LLM) abilities to capture abstract knowledge about world's physics to solve decision-making problems. Yet, the alignment between LLMs' knowledge and the environment can be wrong and limit functional competence due to lack of grounding. In this paper, we study an approach (named GLAM) to achieve this alignment through functional grounding: we consider an agent using an LLM as a policy that is progressively updated as the agent interacts with the environment, leveraging online Reinforcement Learning to improve its performance to solve goals. Using an interactive textual environment designed to study higher-level forms of functional grounding, and a set of spatial and navigation tasks, we study several scientific questions: 1) Can LLMs boost sample efficiency for online learning of various RL tasks? 2) How can it boost different forms of generalization? 3) What is the impact of online learning? We study these questions by functionally grounding several variants (size, architecture) of FLAN-T5.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/carta23a	Thomas Carta, Clément Romac, Thomas Wolf, Sylvain Lamprier, Olivier Sigaud, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer
State and parameter learning with PARIS particle Gibbs	Non-linear state-space models, also known as general hidden Markov models (HMM), are ubiquitous in statistical machine learning, being the most classical generative models for serial data and sequences. Learning in HMM, either via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) or Markov Score Climbing (MSC) requires the estimation of the- smoothing expectation of some additive functionals. Controlling the bias and the variance of this estimation is crucial to establish the convergence of learning algorithms. Our first contribution is to design a novel additive smoothing algorithm, the Parisian particle Gibbs (PPG) sampler, which can be viewed as a PaRIS (Olsson, Westerborn 2017) algorithm driven by conditional SMC moves, resulting in bias-reduced estimates of the targeted quantities. We substantiate the PPG algorithm with theoretical results, including new bounds on bias and variance as well as deviation inequalities. We then establish, in the learning context, and under standard assumptions, non-asymptotic bounds highlighting the value of bias reduction and the implicit Rao–Blackwellization of PPG. These are the first non-asymptotic results of this kind in this setting. We illustrate our theoretical results with numerical experiments supporting our claims.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cardoso23a	Gabriel Cardoso, Yazid Janati El Idrissi, Sylvain Le Corff, Eric Moulines, Jimmy Olsson
One-sided Matrix Completion from Two Observations Per Row	"Given only a few observed entries from a low-rank matrix $X$, matrix completion is the problem of imputing the missing entries, and it formalizes a wide range of real-world settings that involve estimating missing data. However, when there are too few observed entries to complete the matrix, what other aspects of the underlying matrix can be reliably recovered? We study one such problem setting, that of ""one-sided"" matrix completion, where our goal is to recover the right singular vectors of $X$, even in the regime where recovering the left singular vectors is impossible, which arises when there are more rows than columns and very few observations. We propose a natural algorithm that involves imputing the missing values of the matrix $X^TX$ and show that even with only two observations per row in $X$, we can provably recover $X^TX$ as long as we have at least $\Omega(r^2 d \log d)$ rows, where $r$ is the rank and $d$ is the number of columns. We evaluate our algorithm on one-sided recovery of synthetic data and low-coverage genome sequencing. In these settings, our algorithm substantially outperforms standard matrix completion and a variety of direct factorization methods."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cao23d	Steven Cao, Percy Liang, Gregory Valiant
Learning Lightweight Object Detectors via Multi-Teacher Progressive Distillation	Resource-constrained perception systems such as edge computing and vision-for-robotics require vision models to be both accurate and lightweight in computation and memory usage. While knowledge distillation is a proven strategy to enhance the performance of lightweight classification models, its application to structured outputs like object detection and instance segmentation remains a complicated task, due to the variability in outputs and complex internal network modules involved in the distillation process. In this paper, we propose a simple yet surprisingly effective sequential approach to knowledge distillation that progressively transfers the knowledge of a set of teacher detectors to a given lightweight student. To distill knowledge from a highly accurate but complex teacher model, we construct a sequence of teachers to help the student gradually adapt. Our progressive strategy can be easily combined with existing detection distillation mechanisms to consistently maximize student performance in various settings. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully distill knowledge from Transformer-based teacher detectors to convolution-based students, and unprecedentedly boost the performance of ResNet-50 based RetinaNet from 36.5% to 42.0% AP and Mask R-CNN from 38.2% to 42.5% AP on the MS COCO benchmark.

Variational Sparse Inverse Cholesky Approximation for Latent Gaussian Processes via Double Kullback-Leibler Minimization	To achieve scalable and accurate inference for latent Gaussian processes, we propose a variational approximation based on a family of Gaussian distributions whose covariance matrices have sparse inverse Cholesky (SIC) factors. We combine this variational approximation of the posterior with a similar and efficient SIC-restricted Kullback-Leibler-optimal approximation of the prior. We then focus on a particular SIC ordering and nearest-neighbor-based sparsity pattern resulting in highly accurate prior and posterior approximations. For this setting, our variational approximation can be computed via stochastic gradient descent in polylogarithmic time per iteration. We provide numerical comparisons showing that the proposed double-Kullback-Leibler-optimal Gaussian-process approximation (DKLGP) can sometimes be vastly more accurate for stationary kernels than alternative approaches such as inducing-point and mean-field approximations at similar computational complexity.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cao23b	Jian Cao, Myeongjong Kang, Felix Jimenez, Huiyan Sang, Florian Tobias Schaefer, Matthias Katzfuss

Multi-Agent Learning from Learners	"A large body of the ""Inverse Reinforcement Learning"" (IRL) literature focuses on recovering the reward function from a set of demonstrations of an expert agent who acts optimally or noisily optimally. Nevertheless, some recent works move away from the optimality assumption to study the ""Learning from a Learner (LfL)"" problem, where the challenge is inferring the reward function of a learning agent from a sequence of demonstrations produced by progressively improving policies. In this work, we take one of the initial steps in addressing the multi-agent version of this problem and propose a new algorithm, MA-LfL (Multiagent Learning from a Learner). Unlike the state-of-the-art literature, which recovers the reward functions from trajectories produced by agents in some equilibrium, we study the problem of inferring the reward functions of interacting agents in a general sum stochastic game without assuming any equilibrium state. The MA-LfL algorithm is rigorously built on a theoretical result that ensures its validity in the case of agents learning according to a multi-agent soft policy iteration scheme. We empirically test MA-LfL and we observe high positive correlation between the recovered reward functions and the ground truth."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/caliskan23a	Mine Melodi Caliskan, Francesco Chini, Setareh Maghsudi
Doubly Optimal No-Regret Learning in Monotone Games	We consider online learning in multi-player smooth monotone games.

While the $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$ rate is tight for a large class of algorithms including the well-studied extragradient algorithm and optimistic gradient algorithm, it is not optimal for all gradient-based algorithms.

Robust Weight Signatures: Gaining Robustness as Easy as Patching Weights?	"Given a robust model trained to be resilient to one or multiple types of distribution shifts (e.g., natural image corruptions), how is that ""robustness"" encoded in the model weights, and how easily can it be disentangled and/or ""zero-shot"" transferred to some other models? This paper empirically suggests a surprisingly simple answer: linearly - by straightforward model weight arithmetic! We start by drawing several key observations: (i) assuming that we train the same model architecture on both a clean dataset and its corrupted version, a comparison between the two resultant models shows their weights to mostly differ in shallow layers; (ii) the weight difference after projection, which we call ""Robust Weight Signature"" (RWS), appears to be discriminative and indicative of different corruption types; (iii) perhaps most strikingly, for the same corruption type, the RWSs obtained by one model architecture are highly consistent and transferable across different datasets. Based on those RWS observations, we propose a minimalistic model robustness ""patching"" framework that carries a model trained on clean data together with its pre-extracted RWSs. In this way, injecting certain robustness to the model is reduced to directly adding the corresponding RWS to its weight. We experimentally verify our proposed framework to be remarkably (1) lightweight. since RWSs concentrate on the shallowest few layers and we further show they can be painlessly quantized, storing an RWS is up to 13 x more compact than storing the full weight copy; (2) in-situ adjustable. RWSs can be appended as needed and later taken off to restore the intact clean model. We further demonstrate one can linearly re-scale the RWS to control the patched robustness strength; (3) composable. Multiple RWSs can be added simultaneously to patch more comprehensive robustness at once; and (4) transferable. Even when the clean model backbone is continually adapted or updated, RWSs remain as effective patches due to their outstanding cross-dataset transferability."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cai23f	Ruisi Cai, Zhenyu Zhang, Zhangyang Wang
Cyclic Block Coordinate Descent With Variance Reduction for Composite Nonconvex Optimization	Nonconvex optimization is central in solving many machine learning problems, in which block-wise structure is commonly encountered. In this work, we propose cyclic block coordinate methods for nonconvex optimization problems with non-asymptotic gradient norm guarantees. Our convergence analysis is based on a gradient Lipschitz condition with respect to a Mahalanobis norm, inspired by a recent progress on cyclic block coordinate methods. In deterministic settings, our convergence guarantee matches the guarantee of (full-gradient) gradient descent, but with the gradient Lipschitz constant being defined w.r.t. a Mahalanobis norm. In stochastic settings, we use recursive variance reduction to decrease the per-iteration cost and match the arithmetic operation complexity of current optimal stochastic full-gradient methods, with a unified analysis for both finite-sum and infinite-sum cases. We prove a faster linear convergence result when a Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PŁ) condition holds. To our knowledge, this work is the first to provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees — variance-reduced or not — for a cyclic block coordinate method in general composite (smooth + nonsmooth) nonconvex settings. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed cyclic scheme in training deep neural nets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cai23e	Xufeng Cai, Chaobing Song, Stephen Wright, Jelena Diakonikolas

Ske2Grid: Skeleton-to-Grid Representation Learning for Action Recognition	This paper presents Ske2Grid, a new representation learning framework for improved skeleton-based action recognition. In Ske2Grid, we define a regular convolution operation upon a novel grid representation of human skeleton, which is a compact image-like grid patch constructed and learned through three novel designs. Specifically, we propose a graph-node index transform (GIT) to construct a regular grid patch through assigning the nodes in the skeleton graph one by one to the desired grid cells. To ensure that GIT is a bijection and enrich the expressiveness of the grid representation, an up-sampling transform (UPT) is learned to interpolate the skeleton graph nodes for filling the grid patch to the full. To resolve the problem when the one-step UPT is aggressive and further exploit the representation capability of the grid patch with increasing spatial size, a progressive learning strategy (PLS) is proposed which decouples the UPT into multiple steps and aligns them to multiple paired GITs through a compact cascaded design learned progressively. We construct networks upon prevailing graph convolution networks and conduct experiments on six mainstream skeleton-based action recognition datasets. Experiments show that our Ske2Grid significantly outperforms existing GCN-based solutions under different benchmark settings, without bells and whistles. Code and models are available at https://github.com/OSVAI/Ske2Grid.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cai23c	Dongqi Cai, Yangyuxuan Kang, Anbang Yao, Yurong Chen
On the Connection Between MPNN and Graph Transformer	Graph Transformer (GT) recently has emerged as a new paradigm of graph learning algorithms, outperforming the previously popular Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) on multiple benchmarks. Previous work shows that with proper position embedding, GT can approximate MPNN arbitrarily well, implying that GT is at least as powerful as MPNN. In this paper, we study the inverse connection and show that MPNN with virtual node (VN), a commonly used heuristic with little theoretical understanding, is powerful enough to arbitrarily approximate the self-attention layer of GT. In particular, we first show that if we consider one type of linear transformer, the so-called Performer/Linear Transformer, then MPNN + VN with only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ depth and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ width can approximate a self-attention layer in Performer/Linear Transformer. Next, via a connection between MPNN + VN and DeepSets, we prove the MPNN + VN with $\mathcal{O}(n^d)$ width and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ depth can approximate the self-attention layer arbitrarily well, where $d$ is the input feature dimension. Lastly, under some assumptions, we provide an explicit construction of MPNN + VN with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ width and $\mathcal{O}(n)$ depth approximating the self-attention layer in GT arbitrarily well. On the empirical side, we demonstrate that 1) MPNN + VN is a surprisingly strong baseline, outperforming GT on the recently proposed Long Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB) dataset, 2) our MPNN + VN improves over early implementation on a wide range of OGB datasets and 3) MPNN + VN outperforms Linear Transformer and MPNN on the climate modeling task.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cai23b	Chen Cai, Truong Son Hy, Rose Yu, Yusu Wang
Causal Discovery with Latent Confounders Based on Higher-Order Cumulants	Causal discovery with latent confounders is an important but challenging task in many scientific areas. Despite the success of some overcomplete independent component analysis (OICA) based methods in certain domains, they are computationally expensive and can easily get stuck into local optima. We notice that interestingly, by making use of higher-order cumulants, there exists a closed-form solution to OICA in specific cases, e.g., when the mixing procedure follows the One-Latent-Component structure. In light of the power of the closed-form solution to OICA corresponding to the One-Latent-Component structure, we formulate a way to estimate the mixing matrix using the higher-order cumulants, and further propose the testable One-Latent-Component condition to identify the latent variables and determine causal orders. By iteratively removing the share identified latent components, we successfully extend the results on the One-Latent-Component structure to the Multi-Latent-Component structure and finally provide a practical and asymptotically correct algorithm to learn the causal structure with latent variables. Experimental results illustrate the asymptotic correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cai23a	Ruichu Cai, Zhiyi Huang, Wei Chen, Zhifeng Hao, Kun Zhang
What Can Be Learnt With Wide Convolutional Neural Networks?	Understanding how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can efficiently learn high-dimensional functions remains a fundamental challenge. A popular belief is that these models harness the local and hierarchical structure of natural data such as images. Yet, we lack a quantitative understanding of how such structure affects performance, e.g., the rate of decay of the generalisation error with the number of training samples. In this paper, we study infinitely-wide deep CNNs in the kernel regime. First, we show that the spectrum of the corresponding kernel inherits the hierarchical structure of the network, and we characterise its asymptotics. Then, we use this result together with generalisation bounds to prove that deep CNNs adapt to the spatial scale of the target function. In particular, we find that if the target function depends on low-dimensional subsets of adjacent input variables, then the decay of the error is controlled by the effective dimensionality of these subsets. Conversely, if the target function depends on the full set of input variables, then the error decay is controlled by the input dimension. We conclude by computing the generalisation error of a deep CNN trained on the output of another deep CNN with randomly-initialised parameters. Interestingly, we find that, despite their hierarchical structure, the functions generated by infinitely-wide deep CNNs are too rich to be efficiently learnable in high dimension.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cagnetta23a	Francesco Cagnetta, Alessandro Favero, Matthieu Wyart
MyoDex: A Generalizable Prior for Dexterous Manipulation	Human dexterity is a hallmark of motor control behaviors. Our hands can rapidly synthesize new behaviors despite the complexity (multi-articular and multi-joints, with 23 joints controlled by more than 40 muscles) of mosculoskeletal control. In this work, we take inspiration from how human dexterity builds on a diversity of prior experiences, instead of being acquired through a single task. Motivated by this observation, we set out to develop agents that can build upon previous experience to quickly acquire new (previously unattainable) behaviors. Specifically, our approach leverages multi-task learning to implicitly capture a task-agnostic behavioral priors (MyoDex) for human-like dexterity, using a physiologically realistic human hand model – MyoHand. We demonstrate MyoDex's effectiveness in few-shot generalization as well as positive transfer to a large repertoire of unseen dexterous manipulation tasks. MyoDex can solve approximately 3x more tasks and it can accelerate the achievement of solutions by about 4x in comparison to a distillation baseline. While prior work has synthesized single musculoskeletal control behaviors, MyoDex is the first generalizable manipulation prior that catalyzes the learning of dexterous physiological control across a large variety of contact-rich behaviors.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/caggiano23a	Vittorio Caggiano, Sudeep Dasari, Vikash Kumar
Online Mechanism Design for Information Acquisition	We study the problem of designing mechanisms for information acquisition scenarios. This setting models strategic interactions between a uniformed receiver and a set of informed senders. In our model the senders receive information about the underlying state of nature and communicate their observation (either truthfully or not) to the receiver, which, based on this information, selects an action. Our goal is to design mechanisms maximizing the receiver's utility while incentivizing the senders to report truthfully their information. First, we provide an algorithm that efficiently computes an optimal incentive compatible (IC) mechanism. Then, we focus on the online problem in which the receiver sequentially interacts in an unknown game, with the objective of minimizing the cumulative regret w.r.t. the optimal IC mechanism, and the cumulative violation of the incentive compatibility constraints. We investigate two different online scenarios, i.e., the full and bandit feedback settings. For the full feedback problem, we propose an algorithm that guarantees $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and violation, while for the bandit feedback setting we present an algorithm that attains $\tilde{O}(T^{\alpha})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\alpha/2})$ violation for any $\alpha \in [1/2, 1]$. Finally, we complement our results providing a tight lower bound.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cacciamani23a	Federico Cacciamani, Matteo Castiglioni, Nicola Gatti
The SSL Interplay: Augmentations, Inductive Bias, and Generalization	Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful framework to learn representations from raw data without supervision. Yet in practice, engineers face issues such as instability in tuning optimizers and collapse of representations during training. Such challenges motivate the need for a theory to shed light on the complex interplay between the choice of data augmentation, network architecture, and training algorithm. % on the resulting performance in downstream tasks. We study such an interplay with a precise analysis of generalization performance on both pretraining and downstream tasks in kernel regimes, and highlight several insights for SSL practitioners that arise from our theory.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/cabannes23a	Vivien Cabannes, Bobak Kiani, Randall Balestriero, Yann Lecun, Alberto Bietti
Label differential privacy and private training data release	We study differentially private mechanisms for sharing training data in machine learning settings. Our goal is to enable learning of an accurate predictive model while protecting the privacy of each user's label. Previous work established privacy guarantees that assumed the features are public and given exogenously, a setting known as label differential privacy. In some scenarios, this can be a strong assumption that removes the interplay between features and labels from the privacy analysis. We relax this approach and instead assume the features are drawn from a distribution that depends on the private labels. We first show that simply adding noise to the label, as in previous work, can lead to an arbitrarily weak privacy guarantee, and also present methods for estimating this privacy loss from data. We then present a new mechanism that replaces some training examples with synthetically generated data, and show that our mechanism has a much better privacy-utility tradeoff if the synthetic data is 'realistic', in a certain quantifiable sense. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical analysis.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/busa-fekete23a	Robert Istvan Busa-Fekete, Andres Munoz Medina, Umar Syed, Sergei Vassilvitskii
Machine Learning Force Fields with Data Cost Aware Training	Machine learning force fields (MLFF) have been proposed to accelerate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, which finds widespread applications in chemistry and biomedical research. Even for the most data-efficient MLFFs, reaching chemical accuracy can require hundreds of frames of force and energy labels generated by expensive quantum mechanical algorithms, which may scale as $O(n^3)$ to $O(n^7)$, with $n$ proportional to the number of basis functions. To address this issue, we propose a multi-stage computational framework – ASTEROID, which lowers the data cost of MLFFs by leveraging a combination of cheap inaccurate data and expensive accurate data. The motivation behind ASTEROID is that inaccurate data, though incurring large bias, can help capture the sophisticated structures of the underlying force field. Therefore, we first train a MLFF model on a large amount of inaccurate training data, employing a bias-aware loss function to prevent the model from overfitting the potential bias of this data. We then fine-tune the obtained model using a small amount of accurate training data, which preserves the knowledge learned from the inaccurate training data while significantly improving the model's accuracy. Moreover, we propose a variant of ASTEROID based on score matching for the setting where the inaccurate training data are unlabeled. Extensive experiments on MD datasets and downstream tasks validate the efficacy of ASTEROID. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/abukharin3/asteroid.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bukharin23a	Alexander Bukharin, Tianyi Liu, Shengjie Wang, Simiao Zuo, Weihao Gao, Wen Yan, Tuo Zhao
Differentially Private Optimization on Large Model at Small Cost	Differentially private (DP) optimization is the standard paradigm to learn large neural networks that are accurate and privacy-preserving. The computational cost for DP deep learning, however, is notoriously heavy due to the per-sample gradient clipping. Existing DP implementations are 2$\sim$1000$\times$ more costly in time and space complexity than the standard (non-private) training. In this work, we develop a novel Book-Keeping (BK) technique that implements existing DP optimizers (thus achieving the same accuracy), with a substantial improvement on the computational cost. Specifically, BK enables DP training on large models and high dimensional data to be roughly as fast and memory-saving as the standard training, whereas previous DP algorithms can be inefficient or incapable of training due to memory error. The computational advantage of BK is supported by the complexity analysis as well as extensive experiments on vision and language tasks. Our implementation achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy with very small extra cost: on GPT2 and at almost the same memory cost ($<$1% overhead), BK has 1.03$\times$ the time complexity of the standard training (0.83$\times$ training speed in practice), and 0.61$\times$ the time complexity of the most efficient DP implementation (1.36$\times$ training speed in practice). We open-source the codebase for the BK algorithm at https://github.com/awslabs/fast-differential-privacy.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bu23a	Zhiqi Bu, Yu-Xiang Wang, Sheng Zha, George Karypis
Emergence of Sparse Representations from Noise	A hallmark of biological neural networks, which distinguishes them from their artificial counterparts, is the high degree of sparsity in their activations. This discrepancy raises three questions our work helps to answer: (i) Why are biological networks so sparse? (ii) What are the benefits of this sparsity? (iii) How can these benefits be utilized by deep learning models? Our answers to all of these questions center around training networks to handle random noise. Surprisingly, we discover that noisy training introduces three implicit loss terms that result in sparsely firing neurons specializing to high variance features of the dataset. When trained to reconstruct noisy-CIFAR10, neurons learn biological receptive fields. More broadly, noisy training presents a new approach to potentially increase model interpretability with additional benefits to robustness and computational efficiency.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bricken23a	Trenton Bricken, Rylan Schaeffer, Bruno Olshausen, Gabriel Kreiman
Critical Points and Convergence Analysis of Generative Deep Linear Networks Trained with Bures-Wasserstein Loss	We consider a deep matrix factorization model of covariance matrices trained with the Bures-Wasserstein distance. While recent works have made advances in the study of the optimization problem for overparametrized low-rank matrix approximation, much emphasis has been placed on discriminative settings and the square loss. In contrast, our model considers another type of loss and connects with the generative setting. We characterize the critical points and minimizers of the Bures-Wasserstein distance over the space of rank-bounded matrices. The Hessian of this loss at low-rank matrices can theoretically blow up, which creates challenges to analyze convergence of gradient optimization methods. We establish convergence results for gradient flow using a smooth perturbative version of the loss as well as convergence results for finite step size gradient descent under certain assumptions on the initial weights.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/brechet23a	Pierre Bréchet, Katerina Papagiannouli, Jing An, Guido Montufar
Quantifying Human Priors over Social and Navigation Networks	Human knowledge is largely implicit and relational — do we have a friend in common? can I walk from here to there? In this work, we leverage the combinatorial structure of graphs to quantify human priors over such relational data. Our experiments focus on two domains that have been continuously relevant over evolutionary timescales: social interaction and spatial navigation. We find that some features of the inferred priors are remarkably consistent, such as the tendency for sparsity as a function of graph size. Other features are domain-specific, such as the propensity for triadic closure in social interactions. More broadly, our work demonstrates how nonclassical statistical analysis of indirect behavioral experiments can be used to efficiently model latent biases in the data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bravo-hermsdorff23a	Gecia Bravo-Hermsdorff
Provably Learning Object-Centric Representations	Learning structured representations of the visual world in terms of objects promises to significantly improve the generalization abilities of current machine learning models. While recent efforts to this end have shown promising empirical progress, a theoretical account of when unsupervised object-centric representation learning is possible is still lacking. Consequently, understanding the reasons for the success of existing object-centric methods as well as designing new theoretically grounded methods remains challenging. In the present work, we analyze when object-centric representations can provably be learned without supervision. To this end, we first introduce two assumptions on the generative process for scenes comprised of several objects, which we call compositionality and irreducibility. Under this generative process, we prove that the ground-truth object representations can be identified by an invertible and compositional inference model, even in the presence of dependencies between objects. We empirically validate our results through experiments on synthetic data. Finally, we provide evidence that our theory holds predictive power for existing object-centric models by showing a close correspondence between models' compositionality and invertibility and their empirical identifiability.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/brady23a	Jack Brady, Roland S.

ILLUME: Rationalizing Vision-Language Models through Human Interactions	Bootstrapping from pre-trained language models has been proven to be an efficient approach for building vision-language models (VLM) for tasks such as image captioning or visual question answering. However, outputs of these models rarely align with user's rationales for specific answers. In order to improve this alignment and reinforce commonsense reasons, we propose a tuning paradigm based on human interactions with machine-generated data. Our ILLUME executes the following loop: Given an image-question-answer prompt, the VLM samples multiple candidate rationales, and a human critic provides feedback via preference selection, used for fine-tuning. This loop increases the training data and gradually carves out the VLM's rationalization capabilities that are aligned with human intent. Our exhaustive experiments demonstrate that ILLUME is competitive with standard supervised finetuning while using significantly fewer training data and only requiring minimal feedback.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/brack23a	Manuel Brack, Patrick Schramowski, Björn Deiseroth, Kristian Kersting

Diffusion Models as Artists: Are we Closing the Gap between Humans and Machines?	"An important milestone for AI is the development of algorithms that can produce drawings that are indistinguishable from those of humans. Here, we adapt the ""diversity vs. recognizability"" scoring framework from Boutin et al (2022) and find that one-shot diffusion models have indeed started to close the gap between humans and machines. However, using a finer-grained measure of the originality of individual samples, we show that strengthening the guidance of diffusion models helps improve the humanness of their drawings, but they still fall short of approximating the originality and recognizability of human drawings. Comparing human category diagnostic features, collected through an online psychophysics experiment, against those derived from diffusion models reveals that humans rely on fewer and more localized features. Overall, our study suggests that diffusion models have significantly helped improve the quality of machine-generated drawings; however, a gap between humans and machines remains – in part explainable by discrepancies in visual strategies."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/boutin23a	Victor Boutin, Thomas Fel, Lakshya Singhal, Rishav Mukherji, Akash Nagaraj, Julien Colin, Thomas Serre
Quantum Speedups for Zero-Sum Games via Improved Dynamic Gibbs Sampling	We give a quantum algorithm for computing an $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium of a zero-sum game in a $m \times n$ payoff matrix with bounded entries. Given a standard quantum oracle for accessing the payoff matrix our algorithm runs in time $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{m + n}\cdot \epsilon^{-2.5} + \epsilon^{-3})$ and outputs a classical representation of the $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium. This improves upon the best prior quantum runtime of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{m + n} \cdot \epsilon^{-3})$ obtained by [van Apeldoorn, Gilyen '19] and the classical $\widetilde{O}((m + n) \cdot \epsilon^{-2})$ runtime due to [Grigoradis, Khachiyan '95] whenever $\epsilon = \Omega((m +n)^{-1})$. We obtain this result by designing new quantum data structures for efficiently sampling from a slowly-changing Gibbs distribution.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bouland23a	Adam Bouland, Yosheb M Getachew, Yujia Jin, Aaron Sidford, Kevin Tian
In Search for a Generalizable Method for Source Free Domain Adaptation	Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is compelling because it allows adapting an off-the-shelf model to a new domain using only unlabelled data. In this work, we apply existing SFDA techniques to a challenging set of naturally-occurring distribution shifts in bioacoustics, which are very different from the ones commonly studied in computer vision. We find existing methods perform differently relative to each other than observed in vision benchmarks, and sometimes perform worse than no adaptation at all. We propose a new simple method which outperforms the existing methods on our new shifts while exhibiting strong performance on a range of vision datasets. Our findings suggest that existing SFDA methods are not as generalizable as previously thought and that considering diverse modalities can be a useful avenue for designing more robust models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/boudiaf23a	Malik Boudiaf, Tom Denton, Bart Van Merrienboer, Vincent Dumoulin, Eleni Triantafillou
Returning The Favour: When Regression Benefits From Probabilistic Causal Knowledge	A directed acyclic graph (DAG) provides valuable prior knowledge that is often discarded in regression tasks in machine learning. We show that the independences arising from the presence of collider structures in DAGs provide meaningful inductive biases, which constrain the regression hypothesis space and improve predictive performance. We introduce collider regression, a framework to incorporate probabilistic causal knowledge from a collider in a regression problem. When the hypothesis space is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, we prove a strictly positive generalisation benefit under mild assumptions and provide closed-form estimators of the empirical risk minimiser. Experiments on synthetic and climate model data demonstrate performance gains of the proposed methodology.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bouabid23a	Shahine Bouabid, Jake Fawkes, Dino Sejdinovic
Model-agnostic Measure of Generalization Difficulty	The measure of a machine learning algorithm is the difficulty of the tasks it can perform, and sufficiently difficult tasks are critical drivers of strong machine learning models. However, quantifying the generalization difficulty of machine learning benchmarks has remained challenging. We propose what is to our knowledge the first model-agnostic measure of the inherent generalization difficulty of tasks. Our inductive bias complexity measure quantifies the total information required to generalize well on a task minus the information provided by the data. It does so by measuring the fractional volume occupied by hypotheses that generalize on a task given that they fit the training data. It scales exponentially with the intrinsic dimensionality of the space over which the model must generalize but only polynomially in resolution per dimension, showing that tasks which require generalizing over many dimensions are drastically more difficult than tasks involving more detail in fewer dimensions. Our measure can be applied to compute and compare supervised learning, reinforcement learning and meta-learning generalization difficulties against each other. We show that applied empirically, it formally quantifies intuitively expected trends, e.g. that in terms of required inductive bias, MNIST $<$ CIFAR10 $<$ Imagenet and fully observable Markov decision processes (MDPs) $<$ partially observable MDPs. Further, we show that classification of complex images $<$ few-shot meta-learning with simple images. Our measure provides a quantitative metric to guide the construction of more complex tasks requiring greater inductive bias, and thereby encourages the development of more sophisticated architectures and learning algorithms with more powerful generalization capabilities.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/boopathy23a	Akhilan Boopathy, Kevin Liu, Jaedong Hwang, Shu Ge, Asaad Mohammedsaleh, Ila R Fiete

Spherical Fourier Neural Operators: Learning Stable Dynamics on the Sphere	Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have proven to be an efficient and effective method for resolution-independent operator learning in a broad variety of application areas across scientific machine learning. A key reason for their success is their ability to accurately model long-range dependencies in spatio-temporal data by learning global convolutions in a computationally efficient manner. To this end, FNOs rely on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), however, DFTs cause visual and spectral artifacts as well as pronounced dissipation when learning operators in spherical coordinates by incorrectly assuming flat geometry. To overcome this limitation, we generalize FNOs on the sphere, introducing Spherical FNOs (SFNOs) for learning operators on spherical geometries. We apply SFNOs to forecasting atmo- spheric dynamics, and demonstrate stable autoregressive rollouts for a year of simulated time (1,460 steps), while retaining physically plausible dynamics. The SFNO has important implications for machine learning-based simulation of climate dynamics that could eventually help accelerate our response to climate change.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bonev23a	Boris Bonev, Thorsten Kurth, Christian Hundt, Jaideep Pathak, Maximilian Baust, Karthik Kashinath, Anima Anandkumar
Sliced-Wasserstein on Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices for M/EEG Signals	When dealing with electro or magnetoencephalography records, many supervised prediction tasks are solved by working with covariance matrices to summarize the signals. Learning with these matrices requires the usage of Riemanian geometry to account for their structure. In this paper, we propose a new method to deal with distributions of covariance matrices, and demonstrate its computational efficiency on M/EEG multivariate time series. More specifically, we define a Sliced-Wasserstein distance between measures of symmetric positive definite matrices that comes with strong theoretical guarantees. Then, we take advantage of its properties and kernel methods to apply this discrepancy to brain-age prediction from MEG data, and compare it to state-of-the-art algorithms based on Riemannian geometry. Finally, we show that it is an efficient surrogate to the Wasserstein distance in domain adaptation for Brain Computer Interface applications.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bonet23a	Clément Bonet, Benoı̂t Malézieux, Alain Rakotomamonjy, Lucas Drumetz, Thomas Moreau, Matthieu Kowalski, Nicolas Courty
Beyond the Universal Law of Robustness: Sharper Laws for Random Features and Neural Tangent Kernels	"Machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, and a thought-provoking paper by Bubeck and Sellke has analyzed this phenomenon through the lens of over-parameterization: interpolating smoothly the data requires significantly more parameters than simply memorizing it. However, this ""universal"" law provides only a necessary condition for robustness, and it is unable to discriminate between models. In this paper, we address these gaps by focusing on empirical risk minimization in two prototypical settings, namely, random features and the neural tangent kernel (NTK). We prove that, for random features, the model is not robust for any degree of over-parameterization, even when the necessary condition coming from the universal law of robustness is satisfied. In contrast, for even activations, the NTK model meets the universal lower bound, and it is robust as soon as the necessary condition on over-parameterization is fulfilled. This also addresses a conjecture in prior work by Bubeck, Li and Nagaraj. Our analysis decouples the effect of the kernel of the model from an ""interaction matrix"", which describes the interaction with the test data and captures the effect of the activation. Our theoretical results are corroborated by numerical evidence on both synthetic and standard datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10)."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bombari23a	Simone Bombari, Shayan Kiyani, Marco Mondelli
A Robust Optimisation Perspective on Counterexample-Guided Repair of Neural Networks	Counterexample-guided repair aims at creating neural networks with mathematical safety guarantees, facilitating the application of neural networks in safety-critical domains. However, whether counterexample-guided repair is guaranteed to terminate remains an open question. We approach this question by showing that counterexample-guided repair can be viewed as a robust optimisation algorithm. While termination guarantees for neural network repair itself remain beyond our reach, we prove termination for more restrained machine learning models and disprove termination in a general setting. We empirically study the practical implications of our theoretical results, demonstrating the suitability of common verifiers and falsifiers for repair despite a disadvantageous theoretical result. Additionally, we use our theoretical insights to devise a novel algorithm for repairing linear regression models based on quadratic programming, surpassing existing approaches.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/boetius23a	David Boetius, Stefan Leue, Tobias Sutter
Properties of the Mallows Model Depending on the Number of Alternatives: A Warning for an Experimentalist	The Mallows model is a popular distribution for ranked data. We empirically and theoretically analyze how the properties of rankings sampled from the Mallows model change when increasing the number of alternatives. We find that real-world data behaves differently from the Mallows model, yet is in line with its recent variant proposed by Boehmer et al. [IJCAI '21]. As part of our study, we issue several warnings about using the classic Mallows model. For instance, we find that one should be extremely careful when using the Mallows model to generate data for experiments with a varying number of alternatives, as observed trends in such experiments might be due to the changing nature of the generated data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/boehmer23b	Niclas Boehmer, Piotr Faliszewski, Sonja Kraiczy
Subset Selection Based On Multiple Rankings in the Presence of Bias: Effectiveness of Fairness Constraints for Multiwinner Voting Score Functions	"We consider the problem of subset selection where one is given multiple rankings of items and the goal is to select the highest ""quality"" subset. Score functions from the multiwinner voting literature have been used to aggregate rankings into quality scores for subsets. We study this setting of subset selection problems when, in addition, rankings may contain systemic or unconscious biases toward a group of items. For a general model of input rankings and biases, we show that requiring the selected subset to satisfy group fairness constraints can improve the quality of the selection with respect to unbiased rankings. Importantly, we show that for fairness constraints to be effective, different multiwinner score functions may require a drastically different number of rankings: While for some functions, fairness constraints need an exponential number of rankings to recover a close-to-optimal solution, for others, this dependency is only polynomial. This result relies on a novel notion of ""smoothness"" of submodular functions in this setting that quantifies how well a function can ""correctly"" assess the quality of items in the presence of bias. The results in this paper can be used to guide the choice of multiwinner score functions for the subset selection setting considered here; we additionally provide a tool to empirically enable this."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/boehmer23a	Niclas Boehmer, L.

Learning the Dynamics of Sparsely Observed Interacting Systems	We address the problem of learning the dynamics of an unknown non-parametric system linking a target and a feature time series. The feature time series is measured on a sparse and irregular grid, while we have access to only a few points of the target time series. Once learned, we can use these dynamics to predict values of the target from the previous values of the feature time series. We frame this task as learning the solution map of a controlled differential equation (CDE). By leveraging the rich theory of signatures, we are able to cast this non-linear problem as a high-dimensional linear regression. We provide an oracle bound on the prediction error which exhibits explicit dependencies on the individual-specific sampling schemes. Our theoretical results are illustrated by simulations which show that our method outperforms existing algorithms for recovering the full time series while being computationally cheap. We conclude by demonstrating its potential on real-world epidemiological data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bleistein23a	Linus Bleistein, Adeline Fermanian, Anne-Sophie Jannot, Agathe Guilloux
Not all Strongly Rayleigh Distributions Have Small Probabilistic Generating Circuits	Probabilistic modeling is a central task in machine learning. Probabilistic models should be tractable, i.e., allowing tractable probabilistic inference, but also efficient, i.e., being able to represent a large set of probability distributions. Zhang et al. (ICML 2021) recently proposed a new model, probabilistic generating circuits. They raised the question whether every strongly Rayleigh distribution can be efficiently represented by such circuits. We prove that this question has a negative answer, there are strongly Rayleigh distributions that cannot be represented by polynomial-sized probabilistic generating circuits, assuming a widely accepted complexity theoretic conjecture.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/blaser23a	Markus Bläser
FLEX: an Adaptive Exploration Algorithm for Nonlinear Systems	Model-based reinforcement learning is a powerful tool, but collecting data to fit an accurate model of the system can be costly. Exploring an unknown environment in a sample-efficient manner is hence of great importance. However, the complexity of dynamics and the computational limitations of real systems make this task challenging. In this work, we introduce FLEX, an exploration algorithm for nonlinear dynamics based on optimal experimental design. Our policy maximizes the information of the next step and results in an adaptive exploration algorithm, compatible with arbitrary parametric learning models, and requiring minimal computing resources. We test our method on a number of nonlinear environments covering different settings, including time-varying dynamics. Keeping in mind that exploration is intended to serve an exploitation objective, we also test our algorithm on downstream model-based classical control tasks and compare it to other state-of-the-art model-based and model-free approaches. The performance achieved by FLEX is competitive and its computational cost is low.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/blanke23a	Matthieu Blanke, Marc Lelarge
Unit Scaling: Out-of-the-Box Low-Precision Training	We present unit scaling, a paradigm for designing deep learning models that simplifies the use of low-precision number formats. Training in FP16 or the recently proposed FP8 formats offers substantial efficiency gains, but can lack sufficient range for out-of-the-box training. Unit scaling addresses this by introducing a principled approach to model numerics: seeking unit variance of all weights, activations and gradients at initialisation. Unlike alternative methods, this approach neither requires multiple training runs to find a suitable scale nor has significant computational overhead. We demonstrate the efficacy of unit scaling across a range of models and optimisers. We further show that existing models can be adapted to be unit-scaled, training BERT-Large in FP16 and then FP8 with no degradation in accuracy.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/blake23a	Charlie Blake, Douglas Orr, Carlo Luschi

Invariant Slot Attention: Object Discovery with Slot-Centric Reference Frames	Automatically discovering composable abstractions from raw perceptual data is a long-standing challenge in machine learning. Recent slot-based neural networks that learn about objects in a self-supervised manner have made exciting progress in this direction. However, they typically fall short at adequately capturing spatial symmetries present in the visual world, which leads to sample inefficiency, such as when entangling object appearance and pose. In this paper, we present a simple yet highly effective method for incorporating spatial symmetries via slot-centric reference frames. We incorporate equivariance to per-object pose transformations into the attention and generation mechanism of Slot Attention by translating, scaling, and rotating position encodings. These changes result in little computational overhead, are easy to implement, and can result in large gains in terms of data efficiency and overall improvements to object discovery. We evaluate our method on a wide range of synthetic object discovery benchmarks namely CLEVR, Tetrominoes, CLEVRTex, Objects Room and MultiShapeNet, and show promising improvements on the challenging real-world Waymo Open dataset.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/biza23a	Ondrej Biza, Sjoerd Van Steenkiste, Mehdi S.

In or Out? Fixing ImageNet Out-of-Distribution Detection Evaluation	"Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is the problem of identifying inputs which are unrelated to the in-distribution task. The OOD detection performance when the in-distribution (ID) is ImageNet-1K is commonly being tested on a small range of test OOD datasets. We find that most of the currently used test OOD datasets, including datasets from the open set recognition (OSR) literature, have severe issues: In some cases more than 50$%$ of the dataset contains objects belonging to one of the ID classes. These erroneous samples heavily distort the evaluation of OOD detectors. As a solution, we introduce with NINCO a novel test OOD dataset, each sample checked to be ID free, which with its fine-grained range of OOD classes allows for a detailed analysis of an OOD detector's strengths and failure modes, particularly when paired with a number of synthetic ""OOD unit-tests"". We provide detailed evaluations across a large set of architectures and OOD detection methods on NINCO and the unit-tests, revealing new insights about model weaknesses and the effects of pretraining on OOD detection performance.

Modeling Temporal Data as Continuous Functions with Stochastic Process Diffusion	Temporal data such as time series can be viewed as discretized measurements of the underlying function. To build a generative model for such data we have to model the stochastic process that governs it. We propose a solution by defining the denoising diffusion model in the function space which also allows us to naturally handle irregularly-sampled observations. The forward process gradually adds noise to functions, preserving their continuity, while the learned reverse process removes the noise and returns functions as new samples. To this end, we define suitable noise sources and introduce novel denoising and score-matching models. We show how our method can be used for multivariate probabilistic forecasting and imputation, and how our model can be interpreted as a neural process.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bilos23a	Marin Biloš, Kashif Rasul, Anderson Schneider, Yuriy Nevmyvaka, Stephan Günnemann
StriderNet: A Graph Reinforcement Learning Approach to Optimize Atomic Structures on Rough Energy Landscapes	Optimization of atomic structures presents a challenging problem, due to their highly rough and non-convex energy landscape, with wide applications in the fields of drug design, materials discovery, and mechanics. Here, we present a graph reinforcement learning approach, StriderNet, that learns a policy to displace the atoms towards low energy configurations. We evaluate the performance of StriderNet on three complex atomic systems, namely, binary Lennard-Jones particles, calcium silicate hydrates gel, and disordered silicon. We show that StriderNet outperforms all classical optimization algorithms and enables the discovery of a lower energy minimum. In addition, StriderNet exhibits a higher rate of reaching minima with energies, as confirmed by the average over multiple realizations. Finally, we show that StriderNet exhibits inductivity to unseen system sizes that are an order of magnitude different from the training system.

Data-Copying in Generative Models: A Formal Framework	"There has been some recent interest in detecting and addressing memorization of training data by deep neural networks. A formal framework for memorization in generative models, called ""data-copying"" was proposed by Meehan et. al (2020). We build upon their work to show that their framework may fail to detect certain kinds of blatant memorization. Motivated by this and the theory of non-parametric methods, we provide an alternative definition of data-copying that applies more locally. We provide a method to detect data-copying, and provably show that it works with high probability when enough data is available. We also provide lower bounds that characterize the sample requirement for reliable detection."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bhattacharjee23a	Robi Bhattacharjee, Sanjoy Dasgupta, Kamalika Chaudhuri

Bandit Online Linear Optimization with Hints and Queries	"We study variants of the online linear optimization (OLO) problem with bandit feedback, where the algorithm has access to external information about the unknown cost vector. Our motivation is the recent body of work on using such ""hints"" towards improving regret bounds for OLO problems in the full-information setting. Unlike in the full-information OLO setting, with bandit feedback, we first show that one cannot improve the standard regret bounds of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ by using hints, even if they are always well-correlated with the cost vector. In contrast, if the algorithm is empowered to issue queries and if all the responses are correct, then we show $O(\log T)$ regret is achievable. We then show how to make this result more robust—when some of the query responses can be adversarial—by using a little feedback on the quality of the responses."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bhaskara23a	Aditya Bhaskara, Ashok Cutkosky, Ravi Kumar, Manish Purohit
Optimally-weighted Estimators of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy for Likelihood-Free Inference	Likelihood-free inference methods typically make use of a distance between simulated and real data. A common example is the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), which has previously been used for approximate Bayesian computation, minimum distance estimation, generalised Bayesian inference, and within the nonparametric learning framework. The MMD is commonly estimated at a root-$m$ rate, where $m$ is the number of simulated samples. This can lead to significant computational challenges since a large $m$ is required to obtain an accurate estimate, which is crucial for parameter estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel estimator for the MMD with significantly improved sample complexity. The estimator is particularly well suited for computationally expensive smooth simulators with low- to mid-dimensional inputs. This claim is supported through both theoretical results and an extensive simulation study on benchmark simulators.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bharti23a	Ayush Bharti, Masha Naslidnyk, Oscar Key, Samuel Kaski, Francois-Xavier Briol
Neural Algorithmic Reasoning with Causal Regularisation	Recent work on neural algorithmic reasoning has investigated the reasoning capabilities of neural networks, effectively demonstrating they can learn to execute classical algorithms on unseen data coming from the train distribution. However, the performance of existing neural reasoners significantly degrades on out-of-distribution (OOD) test data, where inputs have larger sizes. In this work, we make an important observation: there are many different inputs for which an algorithm will perform certain intermediate computations identically. This insight allows us to develop data augmentation procedures that, given an algorithm's intermediate trajectory, produce inputs for which the target algorithm would have exactly the same next trajectory step. We ensure invariance in the next-step prediction across such inputs, by employing a self-supervised objective derived by our observation, formalised in a causal graph. We prove that the resulting method, which we call Hint-ReLIC, improves the OOD generalisation capabilities of the reasoner. We evaluate our method on the CLRS algorithmic reasoning benchmark, where we show up to 3x improvements on the OOD test data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bevilacqua23a	Beatrice Bevilacqua, Kyriacos Nikiforou, Borja Ibarz, Ioana Bica, Michela Paganini, Charles Blundell, Jovana Mitrovic, Petar Veličković
Robust One-Class Classification with Signed Distance Function using 1-Lipschitz Neural Networks	We propose a new method, dubbed One Class Signed Distance Function (OCSDF), to perform One Class Classification (OCC) by provably learning the Signed Distance Function (SDF) to the boundary of the support of any distribution. The distance to the support can be interpreted as a normality score, and its approximation using 1-Lipschitz neural networks provides robustness bounds against $l2$ adversarial attacks, an under-explored weakness of deep learning-based OCC algorithms. As a result, OCSDF comes with a new metric, certified AUROC, that can be computed at the same cost as any classical AUROC. We show that OCSDF is competitive against concurrent methods on tabular and image data while being way more robust to adversarial attacks, illustrating its theoretical properties. Finally, as exploratory research perspectives, we theoretically and empirically show how OCSDF connects OCC with image generation and implicit neural surface parametrization.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bethune23a	Louis Béthune, Paul Novello, Guillaume Coiffier, Thibaut Boissin, Mathieu Serrurier, Quentin Vincenot, Andres Troya-Galvis
Polyhedral Complex Extraction from ReLU Networks using Edge Subdivision	A neural network consisting of piecewise affine building blocks, such as fully-connected layers and ReLU activations, is itself a piecewise affine function supported on a polyhedral complex. This complex has been previously studied to characterize theoretical properties of neural networks, but, in practice, extracting it remains a challenge due to its high combinatorial complexity. A natural idea described in previous works is to subdivide the regions via intersections with hyperplanes induced by each neuron. However, we argue that this view leads to computational redundancy. Instead of regions, we propose to subdivide edges, leading to a novel method for polyhedral complex extraction. A key to this are sign-vectors, which encode the combinatorial structure of the complex. Our approach allows to use standard tensor operations on a GPU, taking seconds for millions of cells on a consumer grade machine. Motivated by the growing interest in neural shape representation, we use the speed and differentiablility of our method to optimize geometric properties of the complex. The code is available at https://github.com/arturs-berzins/relu_edge_subdivision.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/berzins23a	Arturs Berzins
Differentiable and Transportable Structure Learning	Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) encode a lot of information about a particular distribution in their structure. However, compute required to infer these structures is typically super-exponential in the number of variables, as inference requires a sweep of a combinatorially large space of potential structures. That is, until recent advances made it possible to search this space using a differentiable metric, drastically reducing search time. While this technique— named NOTEARS —is widely considered a seminal work in DAG-discovery, it concedes an important property in favour of differentiability: transportability. To be transportable, the structures discovered on one dataset must apply to another dataset from the same domain. We introduce D-Struct which recovers transportability in the discovered structures through a novel architecture and loss function while remaining fully differentiable. Because D-Struct remains differentiable, our method can be easily adopted in existing differentiable architectures, as was previously done with NOTEARS. In our experiments, we empirically validate D-Struct with respect to edge accuracy and structural Hamming distance in a variety of settings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/berrevoets23a	Jeroen Berrevoets, Nabeel Seedat, Fergus Imrie, Mihaela Van Der Schaar
Constrained Phi-Equilibria	The computational study of equilibria involving constraints on players' strategies has been largely neglected. However, in real-world applications, players are usually subject to constraints ruling out the feasibility of some of their strategies, such as, e.g., safety requirements and budget caps. Computational studies on constrained versions of the Nash equilibrium have lead to some results under very stringent assumptions, while finding constrained versions of the correlated equilibrium (CE) is still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce and computationally characterize constrained Phi-equilibria—a more general notion than constrained CEs—in normal-form games. We show that computing such equilibria is in general computationally intractable, and also that the set of the equilibria may not be convex, providing a sharp divide with unconstrained CEs. Nevertheless, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a constrained (approximate) Phi-equilibrium maximizing a given linear function, when either the number of constraints or that of players' actions is fixed. Moreover, in the special case in which a player's constraints do not depend on other players' strategies, we show that an exact, function-maximizing equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time, while one (approximate) equilibrium can be found with an efficient decentralized no-regret learning algorithm.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bernasconi23b	Martino Bernasconi, Matteo Castiglioni, Alberto Marchesi, Francesco Trovò, Nicola Gatti
Optimal Rates and Efficient Algorithms for Online Bayesian Persuasion	Bayesian persuasion studies how an informed sender should influence beliefs of rational receivers that take decisions through Bayesian updating of a common prior. We focus on the online Bayesian persuasion framework, in which the sender repeatedly faces one or more receivers with unknown and adversarially selected types. First, we show how to obtain a tight $\tilde O(T^{1/2})$ regret bound in the case in which the sender faces a single receiver and has bandit feedback, improving over the best previously known bound of $\tilde O(T^{4/5})$. Then, we provide the first no-regret guarantees for the multi-receiver setting under bandit feedback. Finally, we show how to design no-regret algorithms with polynomial per-iteration running time by exploiting type reporting, thereby circumventing known complexity results on online Bayesian persuasion. We provide efficient algorithms guaranteeing a $O(T^{1/2})$ regret upper bound both in the single- and multi-receiver scenario when type reporting is allowed.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bernasconi23a	Martino Bernasconi, Matteo Castiglioni, Andrea Celli, Alberto Marchesi, Francesco Trovò, Nicola Gatti
Gaussian processes at the Helm(holtz): A more fluid model for ocean currents	Oceanographers are interested in predicting ocean currents and identifying divergences in a current vector field based on sparse observations of buoy velocities. Since we expect current dynamics to be smooth but highly non-linear, Gaussian processes (GPs) offer an attractive model. But we show that applying a GP with a standard stationary kernel directly to buoy data can struggle at both current prediction and divergence identification – due to some physically unrealistic prior assumptions. To better reflect known physical properties of currents, we propose to instead put a standard stationary kernel on the divergence and curl-free components of a vector field obtained through a Helmholtz decomposition. We show that, because this decomposition relates to the original vector field just via mixed partial derivatives, we can still perform inference given the original data with only a small constant multiple of additional computational expense. We illustrate the benefits of our method on synthetic and real oceans data.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/berlinghieri23a	Renato Berlinghieri, Brian L. Trippe, David R.

Certified Robust Neural Networks: Generalization and Corruption Resistance	"Recent work have demonstrated that robustness (to ""corruption"") can be at odds with generalization. Adversarial training, for instance, aims to reduce the problematic susceptibility of modern neural networks to small data perturbations. Surprisingly, overfitting is a major concern in adversarial training despite being mostly absent in standard training. We provide here theoretical evidence for this peculiar ""robust overfitting"" phenomenon. Subsequently, we advance a novel distributionally robust loss function bridging robustness and generalization. We demonstrate both theoretically as well as empirically the loss to enjoy a certified level of robustness against two common types of corruption|data evasion and poisoning attacks|while ensuring guaranteed generalization. We show through careful numerical experiments that our resulting holistic robust (HR) training procedure yields SOTA performance. Finally, we indicate that HR training can be interpreted as a direct extension of adversarial training and comes with a negligible additional computational burden. A ready-to-use python library implementing our algorithm is available at https://github.com/RyanLucas3/HR_Neural_Networks."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bennouna23a	Amine Bennouna, Ryan Lucas, Bart Van Parys
On Second-Order Scoring Rules for Epistemic Uncertainty Quantification	It is well known that accurate probabilistic predictors can be trained through empirical risk minimisation with proper scoring rules as loss functions. While such learners capture so-called aleatoric uncertainty of predictions, various machine learning methods have recently been developed with the goal to let the learner also represent its epistemic uncertainty, i.e., the uncertainty caused by a lack of knowledge and data. An emerging branch of the literature proposes the use of a second-order learner that provides predictions in terms of distributions on probability distributions. However, recent work has revealed serious theoretical shortcomings for second-order predictors based on loss minimisation. In this paper, we generalise these findings and prove a more fundamental result: There seems to be no loss function that provides an incentive for a second-order learner to faithfully represent its epistemic uncertainty in the same manner as proper scoring rules do for standard (first-order) learners. As a main mathematical tool to prove this result, we introduce the generalised notion of second-order scoring rules.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bengs23a	Viktor Bengs, Eyke Hüllermeier, Willem Waegeman
Controllable Neural Symbolic Regression	In symbolic regression, the objective is to find an analytical expression that accurately fits experimental data with the minimal use of mathematical symbols such as operators, variables, and constants. However, the combinatorial space of possible expressions can make it challenging for traditional evolutionary algorithms to find the correct expression in a reasonable amount of time. To address this issue, Neural Symbolic Regression (NSR) algorithms have been developed that can quickly identify patterns in the data and generate analytical expressions. However, these methods, in their current form, lack the capability to incorporate user-defined prior knowledge, which is often required in natural sciences and engineering fields. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel neural symbolic regression method, named Neural Symbolic Regression with Hypothesis (NSRwH) that enables the explicit incorporation of assumptions about the expected structure of the ground-truth expression into the prediction process. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed conditioned deep learning model outperforms its unconditioned counterparts in terms of accuracy while also providing control over the predicted expression structure.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bendinelli23a	Tommaso Bendinelli, Luca Biggio, Pierre-Alexandre Kamienny
Continuously Parameterized Mixture Models	Mixture models are universal approximators of smooth densities but are difficult to utilize in complicated datasets due to restrictions on typically available modes and challenges with initialiations. We show that by continuously parameterizing a mixture of factor analyzers using a learned ordinary differential equation, we can improve the fit of mixture models over direct methods. Once trained, the mixture components can be extracted and the neural ODE can be discarded, leaving us with an effective, but low-resource model. We additionally explore the use of a training curriculum from an easy-to-model latent space extracted from a normalizing flow to the more complex input space and show that the smooth curriculum helps to stabilize and improve results with and without the continuous parameterization. Finally, we introduce a hierarchical version of the model to enable more flexible, robust classification and clustering, and show substantial improvements against traditional parameterizations of GMMs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bender23a	Christopher M Bender, Yifeng Shi, Marc Niethammer, Junier Oliva
Fast as CHITA: Neural Network Pruning with Combinatorial Optimization	The sheer size of modern neural networks makes model serving a serious computational challenge. A popular class of compression techniques overcomes this challenge by pruning or sparsifying the weights of pretrained networks. While useful, these techniques often face serious tradeoffs between computational requirements and compression quality. In this work, we propose a novel optimization-based pruning framework that considers the combined effect of pruning (and updating) multiple weights subject to a sparsity constraint. Our approach, CHITA, extends the classical Optimal Brain Surgeon framework and results in significant improvements in speed, memory, and performance over existing optimization-based approaches for network pruning. CHITA's main workhorse performs combinatorial optimization updates on a memory-friendly representation of local quadratic approximation(s) of the loss function. On a standard benchmark of pretrained models and datasets, CHITA leads to superior sparsity-accuracy tradeoffs than competing methods. For example, for MLPNet with only 2% of the weights retained, our approach improves the accuracy by 63% relative to the state of the art. Furthermore, when used in conjunction with fine-tuning SGD steps, our method achieves significant accuracy gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/mazumder-lab/CHITA .	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/benbaki23a	Riade Benbaki, Wenyu Chen, Xiang Meng, Hussein Hazimeh, Natalia Ponomareva, Zhe Zhao, Rahul Mazumder
TIDE: Time Derivative Diffusion for Deep Learning on Graphs	A prominent paradigm for graph neural networks is based on the message-passing framework. In this framework, information communication is realized only between neighboring nodes. The challenge of approaches that use this paradigm is to ensure efficient and accurate long-distance communication between nodes, as deep convolutional networks are prone to over smoothing. In this paper, we present a novel method based on time derivative graph diffusion (TIDE) to overcome these structural limitations of the message-passing framework. Our approach allows for optimizing the spatial extent of diffusion across various tasks and network channels, thus enabling medium and long-distance communication efficiently. Furthermore, we show that our architecture design also enables local message-passing and thus inherits from the capabilities of local message-passing approaches. We show that on both widely used graph benchmarks and synthetic mesh and graph datasets, the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/behmanesh23a	Maysam Behmanesh, Maximilian Krahn, Maks Ovsjanikov
Explaining Reinforcement Learning with Shapley Values	For reinforcement learning systems to be widely adopted, their users must understand and trust them. We present a theoretical analysis of explaining reinforcement learning using Shapley values, following a principled approach from game theory for identifying the contribution of individual players to the outcome of a cooperative game. We call this general framework Shapley Values for Explaining Reinforcement Learning (SVERL). Our analysis exposes the limitations of earlier uses of Shapley values in reinforcement learning. We then develop an approach that uses Shapley values to explain agent performance. In a variety of domains, SVERL produces meaningful explanations that match and supplement human intuition.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/beechey23a	Daniel Beechey, Thomas M. S.

Predicting Ordinary Differential Equations with Transformers	We develop a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model that recovers scalar ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in symbolic form from irregularly sampled and noisy observations of a single solution trajectory. We demonstrate in extensive empirical evaluations that our model performs better or on par with existing methods in terms of accurate recovery across various settings. Moreover, our method is efficiently scalable: after one-time pretraining on a large set of ODEs, we can infer the governing law of a new observed solution in a few forward passes of the model.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/becker23a	Sören Becker, Michal Klein, Alexander Neitz, Giambattista Parascandolo, Niki Kilbertus
Individually Fair Learning with One-Sided Feedback	"We consider an online learning problem with one-sided feedback, in which the learner is able to observe the true label only for positively predicted instances. On each round, $k$ instances arrive and receive classification outcomes according to a randomized policy deployed by the learner, whose goal is to maximize accuracy while deploying individually fair policies. We first present a novel auditing scheme, capable of utilizing feedback from dynamically-selected panels of multiple, possibly inconsistent, auditors regarding fairness violations. In particular, we show how our proposed auditing scheme allows for algorithmically exploring the resulting accuracy-fairness frontier, with no need for additional feedback from auditors. We then present an efficient reduction from our problem of online learning with one-sided feedback and a panel reporting fairness violations to the contextual combinatorial semi-bandit problem (Cesa-Bianchi & Lugosi, 2009; Gyorgy et al., 2007), allowing us to leverage algorithms for contextual combinatorial semi-bandits to establish multi-criteria no regret guarantees in our setting, simultaneously for accuracy and fairness. Our results eliminate two potential sources of bias from prior work: the ""hidden outcomes"" that are not available to an algorithm operating in the full information setting, and human biases that might be present in any single human auditor, but can be mitigated by selecting a well-chosen panel."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bechavod23a	Yahav Bechavod, Aaron Roth
A Kernel Stein Test of Goodness of Fit for Sequential Models	We propose a goodness-of-fit measure for probability densities modeling observations with varying dimensionality, such as text documents of differing lengths or variable-length sequences. The proposed measure is an instance of the kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD), which has been used to construct goodness-of-fit tests for unnormalized densities. The KSD is defined by its Stein operator: current operators used in testing apply to fixed-dimensional spaces. As our main contribution, we extend the KSD to the variable-dimension setting by identifying appropriate Stein operators, and propose a novel KSD goodness-of-fit test. As with the previous variants, the proposed KSD does not require the density to be normalized, allowing the evaluation of a large class of models. Our test is shown to perform well in practice on discrete sequential data benchmarks.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/baum23a	Jerome Baum, Heishiro Kanagawa, Arthur Gretton
Human-Timescale Adaptation in an Open-Ended Task Space	Foundation models have shown impressive adaptation and scalability in supervised and self-supervised learning problems, but so far these successes have not fully translated to reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we demonstrate that training an RL agent at scale leads to a general in-context learning algorithm that can adapt to open-ended novel embodied 3D problems as quickly as humans. In a vast space of held-out environment dynamics, our adaptive agent (AdA) displays on-the-fly hypothesis-driven exploration, efficient exploitation of acquired knowledge, and can successfully be prompted with first-person demonstrations. Adaptation emerges from three ingredients: (1) meta-reinforcement learning across a vast, smooth and diverse task distribution, (2) a policy parameterised as a large-scale attention-based memory architecture, and (3) an effective automated curriculum that prioritises tasks at the frontier of an agent's capabilities. We demonstrate characteristic scaling laws with respect to network size, memory length, and richness of the training task distribution. We believe our results lay the foundation for increasingly general and adaptive RL agents that perform well across ever-larger open-ended domains.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bauer23a	Jakob Bauer, Kate Baumli, Feryal Behbahani, Avishkar Bhoopchand, Nathalie Bradley-Schmieg, Michael Chang, Natalie Clay, Adrian Collister, Vibhavari Dasagi, Lucy Gonzalez, Karol Gregor, Edward Hughes, Sheleem Kashem, Maria Loks-Thompson, Hannah Openshaw, Jack Parker-Holder, Shreya Pathak, Nicolas Perez-Nieves, Nemanja Rakicevic, Tim Rocktäschel, Yannick Schroecker, Satinder Singh, Jakub Sygnowski, Karl Tuyls, Sarah York, Alexander Zacherl, Lei M Zhang
A Statistical Perspective on Retrieval-Based Models	Many modern high-performing machine learning models increasingly rely on scaling up models, e.g., transformer networks. Simultaneously, a parallel line of work aims to improve the model performance by augmenting an input instance with other (labeled) instances during inference. Examples of such augmentations include task-specific prompts and similar examples retrieved from the training data by a nonparametric component. Despite a growing literature showcasing the promise of these retrieval-based models, their theoretical underpinnings %for such models remain under-explored. In this paper, we present a formal treatment of retrieval-based models to characterize their performance via a novel statistical perspective. In particular, we study two broad classes of retrieval-based classification approaches: First, we analyze a local learning framework that employs an explicit local empirical risk minimization based on retrieved examples for each input instance. Interestingly, we show that breaking down the underlying learning task into local sub-tasks enables the model to employ a low complexity parametric component to ensure good overall performance. The second class of retrieval-based approaches we explore learns a global model using kernel methods to directly map an input instance and retrieved examples to a prediction, without explicitly solving a local learning task.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/basu23a	Soumya Basu, Ankit Singh Rawat, Manzil Zaheer
User-level Private Stochastic Convex Optimization with Optimal Rates	We study the problem of differentially private (DP) stochastic convex optimization (SCO) under the notion of user-level differential privacy. In this problem, there are $n$ users, each contributing $m>1$ samples to the input dataset of the private SCO algorithm, and the notion of indistinguishability embedded in DP is w.r.t. replacing the entire local dataset of any given user. Under smoothness conditions of the loss, we establish the optimal rates for user-level DP-SCO in both the central and local models of DP. In particular, we show, roughly, that the optimal rate is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{nm}}+\frac{\sqrt{d}}{\varepsilon n \sqrt{m}}$ in the central setting and is $\frac{\sqrt{d}}{\varepsilon \sqrt{nm}}$ in the local setting, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the problem and $\varepsilon$ is the privacy parameter. Our algorithms combine new user-level DP mean estimation techniques with carefully designed first-order stochastic optimization methods. For the central DP setting, our optimal rate improves over the rate attained for the same setting in Levy et al. (2021) by $\sqrt{d}$ factor. One of the main ingredients that enabled such an improvement is a novel application of the generalization properties of DP in the context of multi-pass stochastic gradient methods.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bassily23a	Raef Bassily, Ziteng Sun
Moccasin: Efficient Tensor Rematerialization for Neural Networks	The deployment and training of neural networks on edge computing devices pose many challenges. The low memory nature of edge devices is often one of the biggest limiting factors encountered in the deployment of large neural network models. Tensor rematerialization or recompute is a way to address high memory requirements for neural network training and inference. In this paper we consider the problem of execution time minimization of compute graphs subject to a memory budget. In particular, we develop a new constraint programming formulation called Moccasin with only $O(n)$ integer variables, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the compute graph. This is a significant improvement over the works in the recent literature that propose formulations with $O(n^2)$ Boolean variables. We present numerical studies that show that our approach is up to an order of magnitude faster than recent work especially for large-scale graphs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bartan23a	Burak Bartan, Haoming Li, Harris Teague, Christopher Lott, Bistra Dilkina
Interpretable Neural-Symbolic Concept Reasoning	Deep learning methods are highly accurate, yet their opaque decision process prevents them from earning full human trust. Concept-based models aim to address this issue by learning tasks based on a set of human-understandable concepts. However, state-of-the-art concept-based models rely on high-dimensional concept embedding representations which lack a clear semantic meaning, thus questioning the interpretability of their decision process. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Deep Concept Reasoner (DCR), the first interpretable concept-based model that builds upon concept embeddings. In DCR, neural networks do not make task predictions directly, but they build syntactic rule structures using concept embeddings. DCR then executes these rules on meaningful concept truth degrees to provide a final interpretable and semantically-consistent prediction in a differentiable manner. Our experiments show that DCR: (i) improves up to +25% w.r.t. state-of-the-art interpretable concept-based models on challenging benchmarks (ii) discovers meaningful logic rules matching known ground truths even in the absence of concept supervision during training, and (iii), facilitates the generation of counterfactual examples providing the learnt rules as guidance.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/barbiero23a	Pietro Barbiero, Gabriele Ciravegna, Francesco Giannini, Mateo Espinosa Zarlenga, Lucie Charlotte Magister, Alberto Tonda, Pietro Lio, Frederic Precioso, Mateja Jamnik, Giuseppe Marra
Reinforcement Learning with General Utilities: Simpler Variance Reduction and Large State-Action Space	We consider the reinforcement learning (RL) problem with general utilities which consists in maximizing a function of the state-action occupancy measure. Beyond the standard cumulative reward RL setting, this problem includes as particular cases constrained RL, pure exploration and learning from demonstrations among others. For this problem, we propose a simpler single-loop parameter-free normalized policy gradient algorithm. Implementing a recursive momentum variance reduction mechanism, our algorithm achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexities for $\epsilon$-first-order stationarity and $\epsilon$-global optimality respectively, under adequate assumptions. We further address the setting of large finite state action spaces via linear function approximation of the occupancy measure and show a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4})$ sample complexity for a simple policy gradient method with a linear regression subroutine.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/barakat23a	Anas Barakat, Ilyas Fatkhullin, Niao He
MultiDiffusion: Fusing Diffusion Paths for Controlled Image Generation	Recent advances in text-to-image generation with diffusion models present transformative capabilities in image quality. However, user controllability of the generated image, and fast adaptation to new tasks still remains an open challenge, currently mostly addressed by costly and long re-training and fine-tuning or ad-hoc adaptations to specific image generation tasks. In this work, we present MultiDiffusion, a unified framework that enables versatile and controllable image generation, using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, without any further training or finetuning. At the center of our approach is a new generation process, based on an optimization task that binds together multiple diffusion generation processes with a shared set of parameters or constraints. We show that MultiDiffusion can be readily applied to generate high quality and diverse images that adhere to user-provided controls, such as desired aspect ratio (e.g., panorama), and spatial guiding signals, ranging from tight segmentation masks to bounding boxes.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bar-tal23a	Omer Bar-Tal, Lior Yariv, Yaron Lipman, Tali Dekel
Optimizing the Collaboration Structure in Cross-Silo Federated Learning	In federated learning (FL), multiple clients collaborate to train machine learning models together while keeping their data decentralized. Through utilizing more training data, FL suffers from the potential negative transfer problem: the global FL model may even perform worse than the models trained with local data only. In this paper, we propose FedCollab, a novel FL framework that alleviates negative transfer by clustering clients into non-overlapping coalitions based on their distribution distances and data quantities. As a result, each client only collaborates with the clients having similar data distributions, and tends to collaborate with more clients when it has less data. We evaluate our framework with a variety of datasets, models, and types of non-IIDness. Our results demonstrate that FedCollab effectively mitigates negative transfer across a wide range of FL algorithms and consistently outperforms other clustered FL algorithms.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bao23b	Wenxuan Bao, Haohan Wang, Jun Wu, Jingrui He
One Transformer Fits All Distributions in Multi-Modal Diffusion at Scale	This paper proposes a unified diffusion framework (dubbed UniDiffuser) to fit all distributions relevant to a set of multi-modal data in one model. Our key insight is – learning diffusion models for marginal, conditional, and joint distributions can be unified as predicting the noise in the perturbed data, where the perturbation levels (i.e. timesteps) can be different for different modalities. Inspired by the unified view, UniDiffuser learns all distributions simultaneously with a minimal modification to the original diffusion model – perturbs data in all modalities instead of a single modality, inputs individual timesteps in different modalities, and predicts the noise of all modalities instead of a single modality. UniDiffuser is parameterized by a transformer for diffusion models to handle input types of different modalities. Implemented on large-scale paired image-text data, UniDiffuser is able to perform image, text, text-to-image, image-to-text, and image-text pair generation by setting proper timesteps without additional overhead. In particular, UniDiffuser is able to produce perceptually realistic samples in all tasks and its quantitative results (e.g., the FID and CLIP score) are not only superior to existing general-purpose models but also comparable to the bespoken models (e.g., Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2) in representative tasks (e.g., text-to-image generation).	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bao23a	Fan Bao, Shen Nie, Kaiwen Xue, Chongxuan Li, Shi Pu, Yaole Wang, Gang Yue, Yue Cao, Hang Su, Jun Zhu
Dynamic Constrained Submodular Optimization with Polylogarithmic Update Time	Maximizing a monotone submodular function under cardinality constraint $k$ is a core problem in machine learning and database with many basic applications, including video and data summarization, recommendation systems, feature extraction, exemplar clustering, and coverage problems. We study this classic problem in the fully dynamic model where a stream of insertions and deletions of elements of an underlying ground set is given and the goal is to maintain an approximate solution using a fast update time. A recent paper at NeurIPS'20 by Lattanzi, Mitrovic, Norouzi-Fard, Tarnawski, Zadimoghaddam claims to obtain a dynamic algorithm for this problem with a $(\frac{1}{2} -\epsilon)$ approximation ratio and a query complexity bounded by $\mathrm{poly}(\log(n),\log(k),\epsilon^{-1})$. However, as we explain in this paper, the analysis has some important gaps. Having a dynamic algorithm for the problem with polylogarithmic update time is even more important in light of a recent result by Chen and Peng at STOC'22 who show a matching lower bound for the problem – any randomized algorithm with a $\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon$ approximation ratio must have an amortized query complexity that is polynomial in $n$. In this paper, we develop a simpler algorithm for the problem that maintains a $(\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon)$-approximate solution for submodular maximization under cardinality constraint $k$ using a polylogarithmic amortized update time.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/banihashem23a	Kiarash Banihashem, Leyla Biabani, Samira Goudarzi, Mohammadtaghi Hajiaghayi, Peyman Jabbarzade, Morteza Monemizadeh
Robust Budget Pacing with a Single Sample	Major Internet advertising platforms offer budget pacing tools as a standard service for advertisers to manage their ad campaigns.

On the Functional Similarity of Robust and Non-Robust Neural Representations	Model stitching—where the internal representations of two neural networks are aligned linearly—helped demonstrate that the representations of different neural networks for the same task are surprisingly similar in a functional sense. At the same time, the representations of adversarially robust networks are considered to be different from non-robust representations. For example, robust image classifiers are invertible, while non-robust networks are not. Here, we investigate the functional similarity of robust and non-robust representations for image classification with the help of model stitching. We find that robust and non-robust networks indeed have different representations. However, these representations are compatible regarding accuracy. From the point of view of robust accuracy, compatibility decreases quickly after the first few layers but the representations become compatible again in the last layers, in the sense that the properties of the front model can be recovered. Moreover, this is true even in the case of cross-task stitching. Our results suggest that stitching in the initial, preprocessing layers and the final, abstract layers test different kinds of compatibilities. In particular, the final layers are easy to match, because their representations depend mostly on the same abstract task specification, in our case, the classification of the input into $n$ classes.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/balogh23a	András Balogh, Márk Jelasity
Mirror Sinkhorn: Fast Online Optimization on Transport Polytopes	Optimal transport is an important tool in machine learning, allowing to capture geometric properties of the data through a linear program on transport polytopes.

Block Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transform for Nyström Approximation on Distributed Architectures	This article introduces a novel structured random matrix composed blockwise from subsampled randomized Hadamard transforms (SRHTs). The block SRHT is expected to outperform well-known dimension reduction maps, including SRHT and Gaussian matrices on distributed architectures. We prove that a block SRHT with enough rows is an oblivious subspace embedding, i.e., an approximate isometry for an arbitrary low-dimensional subspace with high probability. Our estimate of the required number of rows is similar to that of the standard SRHT. This suggests that the two transforms should provide the same accuracy of approximation in the algorithms. The block SRHT can be readily incorporated into randomized methods for computing a low-rank approximation of a large-scale matrix, such as the Nyström method. For completeness, we revisit this method with a discussion of its implementation on distributed architectures.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/balabanov23a	Oleg Balabanov, Matthias Beaupère, Laura Grigori, Victor Lederer
Tensor Decompositions Meet Control Theory: Learning General Mixtures of Linear Dynamical Systems	Recently Chen and Poor initiated the study of learning mixtures of linear dynamical systems. While linear dynamical systems already have wide-ranging applications in modeling time-series data, using mixture models can lead to a better fit or even a richer understanding of underlying subpopulations represented in the data. In this work we give a new approach to learning mixtures of linear dynamical systems that is based on tensor decompositions. As a result, our algorithm succeeds without strong separation conditions on the components, and can be used to compete with the Bayes optimal clustering of the trajectories. Moreover our algorithm works in the challenging partially-observed setting. Our starting point is the simple but powerful observation that the classic Ho-Kalman algorithm is a relative of modern tensor decomposition methods for learning latent variable models. This gives us a playbook for how to extend it to work with more complicated generative models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bakshi23a	Ainesh Bakshi, Allen Liu, Ankur Moitra, Morris Yau
Implicit Graph Neural Networks: A Monotone Operator Viewpoint	Implicit graph neural networks (IGNNs) – that solve a fixed-point equilibrium equation using Picard iteration for representation learning – have shown remarkable performance in learning long-range dependencies (LRD) in the underlying graphs. However, IGNNs suffer from several issues, including 1) their expressivity is limited by their parameterizations for the well-posedness guarantee, 2) IGNNs are unstable in learning LRD, and 3) IGNNs become computationally inefficient when learning LRD. In this paper, we provide a new well-posedness characterization for IGNNs leveraging monotone operator theory, resulting in a much more expressive parameterization than the existing one. We also propose an orthogonal parameterization for IGNN based on Cayley transform to stabilize learning LRD. Furthermore, we leverage Anderson-accelerated operator splitting schemes to efficiently solve for the fixed point of the equilibrium equation of IGNN with monotone or orthogonal parameterization. We verify the computational efficiency and accuracy of the new models over existing IGNNs on various graph learning tasks at both graph and node levels.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/baker23a	Justin Baker, Qingsong Wang, Cory D Hauck, Bao Wang
Linear optimal partial transport embedding	Optimal transport (OT) has gained popularity due to its various applications in fields such as machine learning, statistics, and signal processing. However, the balanced mass requirement limits its performance in practical problems. To address these limitations, variants of the OT problem, including unbalanced OT, Optimal partial transport (OPT), and Hellinger Kantorovich (HK), have been proposed. In this paper, we propose the Linear optimal partial transport (LOPT) embedding, which extends the (local) linearization technique on OT and HK to the OPT problem. The proposed embedding allows for faster computation of OPT distance between pairs of positive measures. Besides our theoretical contributions, we demonstrate the LOPT embedding technique in point-cloud interpolation and PCA analysis.

Answering Complex Logical Queries on Knowledge Graphs via Query Computation Tree Optimization	Answering complex logical queries on incomplete knowledge graphs is a challenging task, and has been widely studied. Embedding-based methods require training on complex queries and may not generalize well to out-of-distribution query structures. Recent work frames this task as an end-to-end optimization problem, and it only requires a pretrained link predictor. However, due to the exponentially large combinatorial search space, the optimal solution can only be approximated, limiting the final accuracy. In this work, we propose QTO (Query Computation Tree Optimization) that can efficiently find the exact optimal solution. QTO finds the optimal solution by a forward-backward propagation on the tree-like computation graph, i.e., query computation tree. In particular, QTO utilizes the independence encoded in the query computation tree to reduce the search space, where only local computations are involved during the optimization procedure. Experiments on 3 datasets show that QTO obtains state-of-the-art performance on complex query answering, outperforming previous best results by an average of 22%. Moreover, QTO can interpret the intermediate solutions for each of the one-hop atoms in the query with over 90% accuracy.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bai23b	Yushi Bai, Xin Lv, Juanzi Li, Lei Hou
Feed Two Birds with One Scone: Exploiting Wild Data for Both Out-of-Distribution Generalization and Detection	Modern machine learning models deployed in the wild can encounter both covariate and semantic shifts, giving rise to the problems of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and OOD detection respectively. While both problems have received significant research attention lately, they have been pursued independently. This may not be surprising, since the two tasks have seemingly conflicting goals. This paper provides a new unified approach that is capable of simultaneously generalizing to covariate shifts while robustly detecting semantic shifts. We propose a margin-based learning framework that exploits freely available unlabeled data in the wild that captures the environmental test-time OOD distributions under both covariate and semantic shifts. We show both empirically and theoretically that the proposed margin constraint is the key to achieving both OOD generalization and detection. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our framework, outperforming competitive baselines that specialize in either OOD generalization or OOD detection. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/scone.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bai23a	Haoyue Bai, Gregory Canal, Xuefeng Du, Jeongyeol Kwon, Robert D Nowak, Yixuan Li
Efficient preconditioned stochastic gradient descent for estimation in latent variable models	Latent variable models are powerful tools for modeling complex phenomena involving in particular partially observed data, unobserved variables or underlying complex unknown structures. Inference is often difficult due to the latent structure of the model. To deal with parameter estimation in the presence of latent variables, well-known efficient methods exist, such as gradient-based and EM-type algorithms, but with practical and theoretical limitations. In this paper, we propose as an alternative for parameter estimation an efficient preconditioned stochastic gradient algorithm. Our method includes a preconditioning step based on a positive definite Fisher information matrix estimate. We prove convergence results for the proposed algorithm under mild assumptions for very general latent variables models. We illustrate through relevant simulations the performance of the proposed methodology in a nonlinear mixed effects model and in a stochastic block model.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/baey23a	Charlotte Baey, Maud Delattre, Estelle Kuhn, Jean-Benoist Leger, Sarah Lemler
Efficient Self-supervised Learning with Contextualized Target Representations for Vision, Speech and Language	Current self-supervised learning algorithms are often modality-specific and require large amounts of computational resources. To address these issues, we increase the training efficiency of data2vec, a learning objective that generalizes across several modalities. We do not encode masked tokens, use a fast convolutional decoder and amortize the effort to build teacher representations. data2vec 2.0 benefits from the rich contextualized target representations introduced in data2vec which enable a fast self-supervised learner. Experiments on ImageNet-1K image classification show that data2vec 2.0 matches the accuracy of Masked Autoencoders in 16.4x lower pre-training time, on Librispeech speech recognition it performs as well as wav2vec 2.0 in 10.6x less time, and on GLUE natural language understanding it matches a retrained RoBERTa model in half the time. Trading some speed for accuracy results in ImageNet-1K top-1 accuracy of 86.8% with a ViT-L model trained for 150 epochs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/baevski23a	Alexei Baevski, Arun Babu, Wei-Ning Hsu, Michael Auli
Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning	Subgraphs of a larger global graph may be distributed across multiple devices, and only locally accessible due to privacy restrictions, although there may be links between subgraphs. Recently proposed subgraph Federated Learning (FL) methods deal with those missing links across local subgraphs while distributively training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on them. However, they have overlooked the inevitable heterogeneity between subgraphs comprising different communities of a global graph, consequently collapsing the incompatible knowledge from local GNN models. To this end, we introduce a new subgraph FL problem, personalized subgraph FL, which focuses on the joint improvement of the interrelated local GNNs rather than learning a single global model, and propose a novel framework, FEDerated Personalized sUBgraph learning (FED-PUB), to tackle it. Since the server cannot access the subgraph in each client, FED-PUB utilizes functional embeddings of the local GNNs using random graphs as inputs to compute similarities between them, and use the similarities to perform weighted averaging for server-side aggregation. Further, it learns a personalized sparse mask at each client to select and update only the subgraph-relevant subset of the aggregated parameters. We validate our FED-PUB for its subgraph FL performance on six datasets, considering both non-overlapping and overlapping subgraphs, on which it significantly outperforms relevant baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/JinheonBaek/FED-PUB.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/baek23a	Jinheon Baek, Wonyong Jeong, Jiongdao Jin, Jaehong Yoon, Sung Ju Hwang
CLUTR: Curriculum Learning via Unsupervised Task Representation Learning	Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are often known for sample inefficiency and difficult generalization. Recently, Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) emerged as a new paradigm for zero-shot generalization by simultaneously learning a task distribution and agent policies on the generated tasks. This is a non-stationary process where the task distribution evolves along with agent policies; creating an instability over time. While past works demonstrated the potential of such approaches, sampling effectively from the task space remains an open challenge, bottlenecking these approaches. To this end, we introduce CLUTR: a novel unsupervised curriculum learning algorithm that decouples task representation and curriculum learning into a two-stage optimization. It first trains a recurrent variational autoencoder on randomly generated tasks to learn a latent task manifold. Next, a teacher agent creates a curriculum by maximizing a minimax REGRET-based objective on a set of latent tasks sampled from this manifold. Using the fixed-pretrained task manifold, we show that CLUTR successfully overcomes the non-stationarity problem and improves stability. Our experimental results show CLUTR outperforms PAIRED, a principled and popular UED method, in the challenging CarRacing and navigation environments: achieving 10.6X and 45% improvement in zero-shot generalization, respectively. CLUTR also performs comparably to the non-UED state-of-the-art for CarRacing, while requiring 500X fewer environment interactions. We open source our code at https://github.com/clutr/clutr.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/azad23a	Abdus Salam Azad, Izzeddin Gur, Jasper Emhoff, Nathaniel Alexis, Aleksandra Faust, Pieter Abbeel, Ion Stoica
Half-Hop: A graph upsampling approach for slowing down message passing	"Message passing neural networks have shown a lot of success on graph-structured data. However, there are many instances where message passing can lead to over-smoothing or fail when neighboring nodes belong to different classes. In this work, we introduce a simple yet general framework for improving learning in message passing neural networks. Our approach essentially upsamples edges in the original graph by adding ""slow nodes"" at each edge that can mediate communication between a source and a target node. Our method only modifies the input graph, making it plug-and-play and easy to use with existing models. To understand the benefits of slowing down message passing, we provide theoretical and empirical analyses. We report results on several supervised and self-supervised benchmarks, and show improvements across the board, notably in heterophilic conditions where adjacent nodes are more likely to have different labels. Finally, we show how our approach can be used to generate augmentations for self-supervised learning, where slow nodes are randomly introduced into different edges in the graph to generate multi-scale views with variable path lengths."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/azabou23a	Mehdi Azabou, Venkataramana Ganesh, Shantanu Thakoor, Chi-Heng Lin, Lakshmi Sathidevi, Ran Liu, Michal Valko, Petar Veličković, Eva L Dyer
Naive imputation implicitly regularizes high-dimensional linear models	Two different approaches exist to handle missing values for prediction: either imputation, prior to fitting any predictive algorithms, or dedicated methods able to natively incorporate missing values. While imputation is widely (and easily) use, it is unfortunately biased when low-capacity predictors (such as linear models) are applied afterward. However, in practice, naive imputation exhibits good predictive performance. In this paper, we study the impact of imputation in a high-dimensional linear model with MCAR missing data. We prove that zero imputation performs an implicit regularization closely related to the ridge method, often used in high-dimensional problems. Leveraging on this connection, we establish that the imputation bias is controlled by a ridge bias, which vanishes in high dimension. As a predictor, we argue in favor of the averaged SGD strategy, applied to zero-imputed data. We establish an upper bound on its generalization error, highlighting that imputation is benign in the $d \gg \sqrt{n}$ regime. Experiments illustrate our findings.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ayme23a	Alexis Ayme, Claire Boyer, Aymeric Dieuleveut, Erwan Scornet
Gradient Descent Converges Linearly for Logistic Regression on Separable Data	We show that running gradient descent with variable learning rate guarantees loss $f(x) ≤ 1.1 \cdot f(x^*)+\epsilon$ for the logistic regression objective, where the error $\epsilon$ decays exponentially with the number of iterations and polynomially with the magnitude of the entries of an arbitrary fixed solution $x$. This is in contrast to the common intuition that the absence of strong convexity precludes linear convergence of first-order methods, and highlights the importance of variable learning rates for gradient descent. We also apply our ideas to sparse logistic regression, where they lead to an exponential improvement of the sparsity-error tradeoff.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/axiotis23a	Kyriakos Axiotis, Maxim Sviridenko
Dirichlet Diffusion Score Model for Biological Sequence Generation	Designing biological sequences is an important challenge that requires satisfying complex constraints and thus is a natural problem to address with deep generative modeling. Diffusion generative models have achieved considerable success in many applications. Score-based generative stochastic differential equations (SDE) model is a continuous-time diffusion model framework that enjoys many benefits, but the originally proposed SDEs are not naturally designed for modeling discrete data. To develop generative SDE models for discrete data such as biological sequences, here we introduce a diffusion process defined in the probability simplex space with stationary distribution being the Dirichlet distribution. This makes diffusion in continuous space natural for modeling discrete data. We refer to this approach as Dirchlet diffusion score model. We demonstrate that this technique can generate samples that satisfy hard constraints using a Sudoku generation task. This generative model can also solve Sudoku, including hard puzzles, without additional training. Finally, we applied this approach to develop the first human promoter DNA sequence design model and showed that designed sequences share similar properties with natural promoter sequences.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/avdeyev23a	Pavel Avdeyev, Chenlai Shi, Yuhao Tan, Kseniia Dudnyk, Jian Zhou
On the convergence of the MLE as an estimator of the learning rate in the Exp3 algorithm	When fitting the learning data of an individual to algorithm-like learning models, the observations are so dependent and non-stationary that one may wonder what the classical Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) could do, even if it is the usual tool applied to experimental cognition. Our objective in this work is to show that the estimation of the learning rate cannot be efficient if the learning rate is constant in the classical Exp3 (Exponential weights for Exploration and Exploitation) algorithm. Secondly, we show that if the learning rate decreases polynomially with the sample size, then the prediction error and in some cases the estimation error of the MLE satisfy bounds in probability that decrease at a polynomial rate.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/aubert23a	Julien Aubert, Luc Lehéricy, Patricia Reynaud-Bouret
Learning to Initiate and Reason in Event-Driven Cascading Processes	Training agents to control a dynamic environment is a fundamental task in AI. In many environments, the dynamics can be summarized by a small set of events that capture the semantic behavior of the system. Typically, these events form chains or cascades. We often wish to change the system behavior using a single intervention that propagates through the cascade. For instance, one may trigger a biochemical cascade to switch the state of a cell or, in logistics, reroute a truck to meet an unexpected, urgent delivery. We introduce a new supervised learning setup called Cascade. An agent observes a system with known dynamics evolving from some initial state. The agent is given a structured semantic instruction and needs to make an intervention that triggers a cascade of events, such that the system reaches an alternative (counterfactual) behavior. We provide a test-bed for this problem, consisting of physical objects. We combine semantic tree search with an event-driven forward model and devise an algorithm that learns to efficiently search in exponentially large semantic trees. We demonstrate that our approach learns to follow instructions to intervene in new complex scenes. When provided with an observed cascade of events, it can also reason about alternative outcomes.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/atzmon23a	Yuval Atzmon, Eli Meirom, Shie Mannor, Gal Chechik
Infusing Lattice Symmetry Priors in Attention Mechanisms for Sample-Efficient Abstract Geometric Reasoning	The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) (Chollet, 2019) and its most recent language-complete instantiation (LARC) has been postulated as an important step towards general AI. Yet, even state-of-the-art machine learning models struggle to achieve meaningful performance on these problems, falling behind non-learning based approaches. We argue that solving these tasks requires extreme generalization that can only be achieved by proper accounting for core knowledge priors. As a step towards this goal, we focus on geometry priors and introduce LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks. We show that, for any transformation of the hypercubic lattice, there exists a binary attention mask that implements that group action. Hence, our study motivates a modification to the standard attention mechanism, where attention weights are scaled using soft masks generated by a convolutional network. Experiments on synthetic geometric reasoning show that LatFormer requires 2 orders of magnitude fewer data than standard attention and transformers. Moreover, our results on ARC and LARC tasks that incorporate geometric priors provide preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/atzeni23a	Mattia Atzeni, Mrinmaya Sachan, Andreas Loukas
Adversarially Robust PAC Learnability of Real-Valued Functions	We study robustness to test-time adversarial attacks in the regression setting with $\ell_p$ losses and arbitrary perturbation sets. We address the question of which function classes are PAC learnable in this setting. We show that classes of finite fat-shattering dimension are learnable in both the realizable and agnostic settings. Moreover, for convex function classes, they are even properly learnable. In contrast, some non-convex function classes provably require improper learning algorithms. Our main technique is based on a construction of an adversarially robust sample compression scheme of a size determined by the fat-shattering dimension. Along the way, we introduce a novel agnostic sample compression scheme for real-valued functions, which may be of independent interest.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/attias23a	Idan Attias, Steve Hanneke
SGD with AdaGrad Stepsizes: Full Adaptivity with High Probability to Unknown Parameters, Unbounded Gradients and Affine Variance	"We study Stochastic Gradient Descent with AdaGrad stepsizes: a popular adaptive (self-tuning) method for first-order stochastic optimization. Despite being well studied, existing analyses of this method suffer from various shortcomings: they either assume some knowledge of the problem parameters, impose strong global Lipschitz conditions, or fail to give bounds that hold with high probability. We provide a comprehensive analysis of this basic method without any of these limitations, in both the convex and non-convex (smooth) cases, that additionally supports a general ""affine variance"" noise model and provides sharp rates of convergence in both the low-noise and high-noise regimes."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/attia23a	Amit Attia, Tomer Koren
From Robustness to Privacy and Back	We study the relationship between two desiderata of algorithms in statistical inference and machine learning—differential privacy and robustness to adversarial data corruptions. Their conceptual similarity was first observed by Dwork and Lei (STOC 2009), who observed that private algorithms satisfy robustness, and gave a general method for converting robust algorithms to private ones. However, all general methods for transforming robust algorithms into private ones lead to suboptimal error rates. Our work gives the first black-box transformation that converts any adversarially robust algorithm into one that satisfies pure differential privacy. Moreover, we show that for any low-dimensional estimation task, applying our transformation to an optimal robust estimator results in an optimal private estimator. Thus, we conclude that for any low-dimensional task, the optimal error rate for $\varepsilon$-differentially private estimators is essentially the same as the optimal error rate for estimators that are robust to adversarially corrupting $1/\varepsilon$ training samples. We apply our transformation to obtain new optimal private estimators for several high-dimensional statistical tasks, including Gaussian linear regression and PCA. Finally, we present an extension of our transformation that leads to approximately differentially private algorithms whose error does not depend on the range of the output space, which is impossible under pure differential privacy.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/asi23b	Hilal Asi, Jonathan Ullman, Lydia Zakynthinou
Near-Optimal Algorithms for Private Online Optimization in the Realizable Regime	We consider online learning problems in the realizable setting, where there is a zero-loss solution, and propose new Differentially Private (DP) algorithms that obtain near-optimal regret bounds. For the problem of online prediction from experts, we design new algorithms that obtain near-optimal regret $O \big( \varepsilon^{-1} \mathsf{poly}(\log{d}) \big)$ where $d$ is the number of experts. This significantly improves over the best existing regret bounds for the DP non-realizable setting which are $O \big( \varepsilon^{-1} \min\big\{d, \sqrt{T\log d}\big\} \big)$. We also develop an adaptive algorithm for the small-loss setting with regret $(L^\star+ \varepsilon^{-1}) \cdot O(\mathsf{poly}(\log{d}))$ where $L^\star$ is the total loss of the best expert. Additionally, we consider DP online convex optimization in the realizable setting and propose an algorithm with near-optimal regret $O \big(\varepsilon^{-1} \mathsf{poly}(d) \big)$, as well as an algorithm for the smooth case with regret $O \big( (\sqrt{Td}/\varepsilon)^{2/3} \big)$, both significantly improving over existing bounds in the non-realizable regime.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/asi23a	Hilal Asi, Vitaly Feldman, Tomer Koren, Kunal Talwar
Prototype-Sample Relation Distillation: Towards Replay-Free Continual Learning	In Continual learning (CL) balancing effective adaptation while combating catastrophic forgetting is a central challenge. Many of the recent best-performing methods utilize various forms of prior task data, e.g. a replay buffer, to tackle the catastrophic forgetting problem. Having access to previous task data can be restrictive in many real-world scenarios, for example when task data is sensitive or proprietary. To overcome the necessity of using previous tasks' data, in this work, we start with strong representation learning methods that have been shown to be less prone to forgetting. We propose a holistic approach to jointly learn the representation and class prototypes while maintaining the relevance of old class prototypes and their embedded similarities. Specifically, samples are mapped to an embedding space where the representations are learned using a supervised contrastive loss. Class prototypes are evolved continually in the same latent space, enabling learning and prediction at any point. To continually adapt the prototypes without keeping any prior task data, we propose a novel distillation loss that constrains class prototypes to maintain relative similarities as compared to new task data. This method yields state-of-the-art performance in the task-incremental setting, outperforming methods relying on large amounts of data, and provides strong performance in the class-incremental setting without using any stored data points.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/asadi23a	Nader Asadi, Mohammadreza Davari, Sudhir Mudur, Rahaf Aljundi, Eugene Belilovsky
Faster Rates of Convergence to Stationary Points in Differentially Private Optimization	We study the problem of approximating stationary points of Lipschitz and smooth functions under $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy (DP) in both the finite-sum and stochastic settings. A point $\widehat{w}$ is called an $\alpha$-stationary point of a function $F:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ if $\|\nabla F(\widehat{w})\|\leq \alpha$. We give a new construction that improves over the existing rates in the stochastic optimization setting, where the goal is to find approximate stationary points of the population risk given $n$ samples. Our construction finds a $\tilde{O}\big(\frac{1}{n^{1/3}} + \big[\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}\big]^{1/2}\big)$-stationary point of the population risk in time linear in $n$. We also provide an efficient algorithm that finds an $\tilde{O}\big(\big[\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}\big]^{2/3}\big)$-stationary point in the finite-sum setting. This improves on the previous best rate of $\tilde{O}\big(\big[\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}\big]^{1/2}\big)$. Furthermore, under the additional assumption of convexity, we completely characterize the sample complexity of finding stationary points of the population risk (up to polylog factors) and show that the optimal rate on population stationarity is $\tilde \Theta\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}\big)$. Finally, we show that our methods can be used to provide dimension-independent rates of $O\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+\min\big(\big[\frac{\sqrt{rank}}{n\varepsilon}\big]^{2/3},\frac{1}{(n\varepsilon)^{2/5}}\big)\big)$ on population stationarity for Generalized Linear Models (GLM), where $rank$ is the rank of the design matrix, which improves upon the previous best known rate.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/arora23a	Raman Arora, Raef Bassily, Tomás González, Cristóbal A Guzmán, Michael Menart, Enayat Ullah
Principled Acceleration of Iterative Numerical Methods Using Machine Learning	Iterative methods are ubiquitous in large-scale scientific computing applications, and a number of approaches based on meta-learning have been recently proposed to accelerate them. However, a systematic study of these approaches and how they differ from meta-learning is lacking. In this paper, we propose a framework to analyze such learning-based acceleration approaches, where one can immediately identify a departure from classical meta-learning. We theoretically show that this departure may lead to arbitrary deterioration of model performance, and at the same time, we identify a methodology to ameliorate it by modifying the loss objective, leading to a novel training method for learning-based acceleration of iterative algorithms. We demonstrate the significant advantage and versatility of the proposed approach through various numerical applications.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/arisaka23a	Sohei Arisaka, Qianxiao Li
Polynomial Time and Private Learning of Unbounded Gaussian Mixture Models	We study the problem of privately estimating the parameters of $d$-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with $k$ components. For this, we develop a technique to reduce the problem to its non-private counterpart. This allows us to privatize existing non-private algorithms in a blackbox manner, while incurring only a small overhead in the sample complexity and running time. As the main application of our framework, we develop an $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differentially private algorithm to learn GMMs using the non-private algorithm of Moitra and Valiant (2010) as a blackbox. Consequently, this gives the first sample complexity upper bound and first polynomial time algorithm for privately learning GMMs without any boundedness assumptions on the parameters. As part of our analysis, we prove a tight (up to a constant factor) lower bound on the total variation distance of high-dimensional Gaussians which can be of independent interest.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/arbas23a	Jamil Arbas, Hassan Ashtiani, Christopher Liaw
Exponential Smoothing for Off-Policy Learning	Off-policy learning (OPL) aims at finding improved policies from logged bandit data, often by minimizing the inverse propensity scoring (IPS) estimator of the risk. In this work, we investigate a smooth regularization for IPS, for which we derive a two-sided PAC-Bayes generalization bound. The bound is tractable, scalable, interpretable and provides learning certificates. In particular, it is also valid for standard IPS without making the assumption that the importance weights are bounded. We demonstrate the relevance of our approach and its favorable performance through a set of learning tasks. Since our bound holds for standard IPS, we are able to provide insight into when regularizing IPS is useful. Namely, we identify cases where regularization might not be needed. This goes against the belief that, in practice, clipped IPS often enjoys favorable performance than standard IPS in OPL.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/aouali23a	Imad Aouali, Victor-Emmanuel Brunel, David Rohde, Anna Korba
Mixing Predictions for Online Metric Algorithms	A major technique in learning-augmented online algorithms is combining multiple algorithms or predictors. Since the performance of each predictor may vary over time, it is desirable to use not the single best predictor as a benchmark, but rather a dynamic combination which follows different predictors at different times. We design algorithms that combine predictions and are competitive against such dynamic combinations for a wide class of online problems, namely, metrical task systems. Against the best (in hindsight) unconstrained combination of $\ell$ predictors, we obtain a competitive ratio of $O(\ell^2)$, and show that this is best possible. However, for a benchmark with slightly constrained number of switches between different predictors, we can get a $(1+\epsilon)$-competitive algorithm. Moreover, our algorithms can be adapted to access predictors in a bandit-like fashion, querying only one predictor at a time. An unexpected implication of one of our lower bounds is a new structural insight about covering formulations for the $k$-server problem.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/antoniadis23b	Antonios Antoniadis, Christian Coester, Marek Elias, Adam Polak, Bertrand Simon
The Saddle-Point Method in Differential Privacy	We characterize the differential privacy guarantees of privacy mechanisms in the large-composition regime, i.e., when a privacy mechanism is sequentially applied a large number of times to sensitive data. Via exponentially tilting the privacy loss random variable, we derive a new formula for the privacy curve expressing it as a contour integral over an integration path that runs parallel to the imaginary axis with a free real-axis intercept. Then, using the method of steepest descent from mathematical physics, we demonstrate that the choice of saddle-point as the real-axis intercept yields closed-form accurate approximations of the desired contour integral. This procedure—dubbed the saddle-point accountant (SPA)—yields a constant-time accurate approximation of the privacy curve. Theoretically, our results can be viewed as a refinement of both Gaussian Differential Privacy and the moments accountant method found in Rényi Differential Privacy. In practice, we demonstrate through numerical experiments that the SPA provides a precise approximation of privacy guarantees competitive with purely numerical-based methods (such as FFT-based accountants), while enjoying closed-form mathematical expressions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/alghamdi23a	Wael Alghamdi, Juan Felipe Gomez, Shahab Asoodeh, Flavio Calmon, Oliver Kosut, Lalitha Sankar
Recasting Self-Attention with Holographic Reduced Representations	"In recent years, self-attention has become the dominant paradigm for sequence modeling in a variety of domains. However, in domains with very long sequence lengths the $\mathcal{O}(T^2)$ memory and $\mathcal{O}(T^2 H)$ compute costs can make using transformers infeasible. Motivated by problems in malware detection, where sequence lengths of $T \geq 100,000$ are a roadblock to deep learning, we re-cast self-attention using the neuro-symbolic approach of Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR). In doing so we perform the same high-level strategy of the standard self-attention: a set of queries matching against a set of keys, and returning a weighted response of the values for each key. Implemented as a ""Hrrformer"" we obtain several benefits including $\mathcal{O}(T H \log H)$ time complexity, $\mathcal{O}(T H)$ space complexity, and convergence in $10\times$ fewer epochs. Nevertheless, the Hrrformer achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy on LRA benchmarks and we are able to learn with just a single layer. Combined, these benefits make our Hrrformer the first viable Transformer for such long malware classification sequences and up to $280\times$ faster to train on the Long Range Arena benchmark."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/alam23a	Mohammad Mahmudul Alam, Edward Raff, Stella Biderman, Tim Oates, James Holt
Convergence of First-Order Methods for Constrained Nonconvex Optimization with Dependent Data	We focus on analyzing the classical stochastic projected gradient methods under a general dependent data sampling scheme for constrained smooth nonconvex optimization. We show the worst-case rate of convergence $\tilde{O}(t^{-1/4})$ and complexity $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ for achieving an $\varepsilon$-near stationary point in terms of the norm of the gradient of Moreau envelope and gradient mapping. While classical convergence guarantee requires i.i.d. data sampling from the target distribution, we only require a mild mixing condition of the conditional distribution, which holds for a wide class of Markov chain sampling algorithms. This improves the existing complexity for the constrained smooth nonconvex optimization with dependent data from $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ with a significantly simpler analysis. We illustrate the generality of our approach by deriving convergence results with dependent data for stochastic proximal gradient methods, adaptive stochastic gradient algorithm AdaGrad and stochastic gradient algorithm with heavy ball momentum. As an application, we obtain first online nonnegative matrix factorization algorithms for dependent data based on stochastic projected gradient methods with adaptive step sizes and optimal rate of convergence.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/alacaoglu23a	Ahmet Alacaoglu, Hanbaek Lyu
Towards credible visual model interpretation with path attribution	With its inspirational roots in game-theory, path attribution framework stands out among the post-hoc model interpretation techniques due to its axiomatic nature. However, recent developments show that despite being axiomatic, path attribution methods can compute counter-intuitive feature attributions. Not only that, for deep visual models, the methods may also not conform to the original game-theoretic intuitions that are the basis of their axiomatic nature. To address these issues, we perform a systematic investigation of the path attribution framework. We first pinpoint the conditions in which the counter-intuitive attributions of deep visual models can be avoided under this framework. Then, we identify a mechanism of integrating the attributions over the paths such that they computationally conform to the original insights of game-theory. These insights are eventually combined into a method, which provides intuitive and reliable feature attributions. We also establish the findings empirically by evaluating the method on multiple datasets, models and evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments show a consistent quantitative and qualitative gain in the results over the baselines.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/akhtar23a	Naveed Akhtar, Mohammad A. A. K. Jalwana

Sequential Underspecified Instrument Selection for Cause-Effect Estimation	Instrumental variable (IV) methods are used to estimate causal effects in settings with unobserved confounding, where we cannot directly experiment on the treatment variable. Instruments are variables which only affect the outcome indirectly via the treatment variable(s). Most IV applications focus on low-dimensional treatments and crucially require at least as many instruments as treatments. This assumption is restrictive: in the natural sciences we often seek to infer causal effects of high-dimensional treatments (e.g., the effect of gene expressions or microbiota on health and disease), but can only run few experiments with a limited number of instruments (e.g., drugs or antibiotics). In such under-specified problems, the full treatment effect is not identifiable in a single experiment even in the linear case. We show that one can still reliably recover the projection of the treatment effect onto the instrumented subspace and develop techniques to consistently combine such partial estimates from different sets of instruments. We then leverage our combined estimators in an algorithm that iteratively proposes the most informative instruments at each round of experimentation to maximize the overall information about the full causal effect.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ailer23a	Elisabeth Ailer, Jason Hartford, Niki Kilbertus
Interventional Causal Representation Learning	Causal representation learning seeks to extract high-level latent factors from low-level sensory data. Most existing methods rely on observational data and structural assumptions (e.g., conditional independence) to identify the latent factors. However, interventional data is prevalent across applications. Can interventional data facilitate causal representation learning? We explore this question in this paper. The key observation is that interventional data often carries geometric signatures of the latent factors' support (i.e. what values each latent can possibly take). For example, when the latent factors are causally connected, interventions can break the dependency between the intervened latents' support and their ancestors'. Leveraging this fact, we prove that the latent causal factors can be identified up to permutation and scaling given data from perfect do interventions. Moreover, we can achieve block affine identification, namely the estimated latent factors are only entangled with a few other latents if we have access to data from imperfect interventions. These results highlight the unique power of interventional data in causal representation learning; they can enable provable identification of latent factors without any assumptions about their distributions or dependency structure.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ahuja23a	Kartik Ahuja, Divyat Mahajan, Yixin Wang, Yoshua Bengio
Using Large Language Models to Simulate Multiple Humans and Replicate Human Subject Studies	"We introduce a new type of test, called a Turing Experiment (TE), for evaluating to what extent a given language model, such as GPT models, can simulate different aspects of human behavior. A TE can also reveal consistent distortions in a language model's simulation of a specific human behavior. Unlike the Turing Test, which involves simulating a single arbitrary individual, a TE requires simulating a representative sample of participants in human subject research. We carry out TEs that attempt to replicate well-established findings from prior studies. We design a methodology for simulating TEs and illustrate its use to compare how well different language models are able to reproduce classic economic, psycholinguistic, and social psychology experiments: Ultimatum Game, Garden Path Sentences, Milgram Shock Experiment, and Wisdom of Crowds. In the first three TEs, the existing findings were replicated using recent models, while the last TE reveals a ""hyper-accuracy distortion"" present in some language models (including ChatGPT and GPT-4), which could affect downstream applications in education and the arts."	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/aher23a	Gati V Aher, Rosa I.

Explaining the effects of non-convergent MCMC in the training of Energy-Based Models	In this paper, we quantify the impact of using non-convergent Markov chains to train Energy-Based models (EBMs). In particular, we show analytically that EBMs trained with non-persistent short runs to estimate the gradient can perfectly reproduce a set of empirical statistics of the data, not at the level of the equilibrium measure, but through a precise dynamical process. Our results provide a first-principles explanation for the observations of recent works proposing the strategy of using short runs starting from random initial conditions as an efficient way to generate high-quality samples in EBMs, and lay the groundwork for using EBMs as diffusion models. After explaining this effect in generic EBMs, we analyze two solvable models in which the effect of the non-convergent sampling in the trained parameters can be described in detail. Finally, we test these predictions numerically on a ConvNet EBM and a Boltzmann machine.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/agoritsas23a	Elisabeth Agoritsas, Giovanni Catania, Aurélien Decelle, Beatriz Seoane
Constrained Causal Bayesian Optimization	We propose constrained causal Bayesian optimization (cCBO), an approach for finding interventions in a known causal graph that optimize a target variable under some constraints. cCBO first reduces the search space by exploiting the graph structure and, if available, an observational dataset; and then solves the restricted optimization problem by modelling target and constraint quantities using Gaussian processes and by sequentially selecting interventions via a constrained expected improvement acquisition function. We propose different surrogate models that enable to integrate observational and interventional data while capturing correlation among effects with increasing levels of sophistication. We evaluate cCBO on artificial and real-world causal graphs showing successful trade off between fast convergence and percentage of feasible interventions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/aglietti23a	Virginia Aglietti, Alan Malek, Ira Ktena, Silvia Chiappa
Hypothesis Transfer Learning with Surrogate Classification Losses: Generalization Bounds through Algorithmic Stability	Hypothesis transfer learning (HTL) contrasts domain adaptation by allowing for a previous task leverage, named the source, into a new one, the target, without requiring access to the source data. Indeed, HTL relies only on a hypothesis learnt from such source data, relieving the hurdle of expansive data storage and providing great practical benefits. Hence, HTL is highly beneficial for real-world applications relying on big data. The analysis of such a method from a theoretical perspective faces multiple challenges, particularly in classification tasks. This paper deals with this problem by studying the learning theory of HTL through algorithmic stability, an attractive theoretical framework for machine learning algorithms analysis. In particular, we are interested in the statistical behavior of the regularized empirical risk minimizers in the case of binary classification. Our stability analysis provides learning guarantees under mild assumptions. Consequently, we derive several complexity-free generalization bounds for essential statistical quantities like the training error, the excess risk and cross-validation estimates. These refined bounds allow understanding the benefits of transfer learning and comparing the behavior of standard losses in different scenarios, leading to valuable insights for practitioners.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/aghbalou23a	Anass Aghbalou, Guillaume Staerman
Scaling Laws for Generative Mixed-Modal Language Models	Generative language models define distributions over sequences of tokens that can represent essentially any combination of data modalities (e.g., any permutation of image tokens from VQ-VAEs, speech tokens from HuBERT, BPE tokens for language or code, and so on). To better understand the scaling properties of such mixed-modal models, we conducted over 250 experiments using seven different modalities and model sizes ranging from 8 million to 30 billion, trained on 5-100 billion tokens. We report new mixed-modal scaling laws that unify the contributions of individual modalities and the interactions between them. Specifically, we explicitly model the optimal synergy and competition due to data and model size as an additive term to previous uni-modal scaling laws. We also find four empirical phenomena observed during the training, such as emergent coordinate-ascent style training that naturally alternates between modalities, guidelines for selecting critical hyper-parameters, and connections between mixed-modal competition and training stability. Finally, we test our scaling law by training a 30B speech-text model, which significantly outperforms the corresponding unimodal models. Overall, our research provides valuable insights into the design and training of mixed-modal generative models, an important new class of unified models that have unique distributional properties.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/aghajanyan23a	Armen Aghajanyan, Lili Yu, Alexis Conneau, Wei-Ning Hsu, Karen Hambardzumyan, Susan Zhang, Stephen Roller, Naman Goyal, Omer Levy, Luke Zettlemoyer
Adaptive IMLE for Few-shot Pretraining-free Generative Modelling	Despite their success on large datasets, GANs have been difficult to apply in the few-shot setting, where only a limited number of training examples are provided. Due to mode collapse, GANs tend to ignore some training examples, causing overfitting to a subset of the training dataset, which is small in the first place. A recent method called Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) is an alternative to GAN that tries to address this issue. It uses the same kind of generators as GANs but trains it with a different objective that encourages mode coverage. However, the theoretical guarantees of IMLE hold under a restrictive condition that the optimal likelihood at all data points is the same. In this paper, we present a more generalized formulation of IMLE which includes the original formulation as a special case, and we prove that the theoretical guarantees hold under weaker conditions. Using this generalized formulation, we further derive a new algorithm, which we dub Adaptive IMLE, which can adapt to the varying difficulty of different training examples. We demonstrate on multiple few-shot image synthesis datasets that our method significantly outperforms existing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/mehranagh20/AdaIMLE.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/aghabozorgi23a	Mehran Aghabozorgi, Shichong Peng, Ke Li
SemSup-XC: Semantic Supervision for Zero and Few-shot Extreme Classification	Extreme classification (XC) involves predicting over large numbers of classes (thousands to millions), with real-world applications like news article classification and e-commerce product tagging. The zero-shot version of this task requires generalization to novel classes without additional supervision. In this paper, we develop SemSup-XC, a model that achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot and few-shot performance on three XC datasets derived from legal, e-commerce, and Wikipedia data. To develop SemSup-XC, we use automatically collected semantic class descriptions to represent classes and facilitate generalization through a novel hybrid matching module that matches input instances to class descriptions using a combination of semantic and lexical similarity. Trained with contrastive learning, SemSup-XC significantly outperforms baselines and establishes state-of-the-art performance on all three datasets considered, gaining up to 12 precision points on zero-shot and more than 10 precision points on one-shot tests, with similar gains for recall@10. Our ablation studies highlight the relative importance of our hybrid matching module and automatically collected class descriptions.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/aggarwal23a	Pranjal Aggarwal, Ameet Deshpande, Karthik R Narasimhan
Global optimality of Elman-type RNNs in the mean-field regime	We analyze Elman-type recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their training in the mean-field regime. Specifically, we show convergence of gradient descent training dynamics of the RNN to the corresponding mean-field formulation in the large width limit. We also show that the fixed points of the limiting infinite-width dynamics are globally optimal, under some assumptions on the initialization of the weights. Our results establish optimality for feature-learning with wide RNNs in the mean-field regime.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/agazzi23a	Andrea Agazzi, Jianfeng Lu, Sayan Mukherjee
Second-order regression models exhibit progressive sharpening to the edge of stability	Recent studies of gradient descent with large step sizes have shown that there is often a regime with an initial increase in the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian (progressive sharpening), followed by a stabilization of the eigenvalue near the maximum value which allows convergence (edge of stability). These phenomena are intrinsically non-linear and do not happen for models in the constant Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime, for which the predictive function is approximately linear in the parameters. As such, we consider the next simplest class of predictive models, namely those that are quadratic in the parameters, which we call second-order regression models. For quadratic objectives in two dimensions, we prove that this second-order regression model exhibits progressive sharpening of the NTK eigenvalue towards a value that differs slightly from the edge of stability, which we explicitly compute. In higher dimensions, the model generically shows similar behavior, even without the specific structure of a neural network, suggesting that progressive sharpening and edge-of-stability behavior aren't unique features of neural networks, and could be a more general property of discrete learning algorithms in high-dimensional non-linear models.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/agarwala23b	Atish Agarwala, Fabian Pedregosa, Jeffrey Pennington
SAM operates far from home: eigenvalue regularization as a dynamical phenomenon	The Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) optimization algorithm has been shown to control large eigenvalues of the loss Hessian and provide generalization benefits in a variety of settings. The original motivation for SAM was a modified loss function which penalized sharp minima; subsequent analyses have also focused on the behavior near minima. However, our work reveals that SAM provides a strong regularization of the eigenvalues throughout the learning trajectory. We show that in a simplified setting, SAM dynamically induces a stabilization related to the edge of stability (EOS) phenomenon observed in large learning rate gradient descent. Our theory predicts the largest eigenvalue as a function of the learning rate and SAM radius parameters. Finally, we show that practical models can also exhibit this EOS stabilization, and that understanding SAM must account for these dynamics far away from any minima.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/agarwala23a	Atish Agarwala, Yann Dauphin
BNN-DP: Robustness Certification of Bayesian Neural Networks via Dynamic Programming	In this paper, we introduce BNN-DP, an efficient algorithmic framework for analysis of adversarial robustness of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). Given a compact set of input points $T\subset \mathbb{R}^n$, BNN-DP computes lower and upper bounds on the BNN's predictions for all the points in $T$. The framework is based on an interpretation of BNNs as stochastic dynamical systems, which enables the use of Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithms to bound the prediction range along the layers of the network. Specifically, the method uses bound propagation techniques and convex relaxations to derive a backward recursion procedure to over-approximate the prediction range of the BNN with piecewise affine functions. The algorithm is general and can handle both regression and classification tasks. On a set of experiments on various regression and classification tasks and BNN architectures, we show that BNN-DP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to four orders of magnitude in both tightness of the bounds and computational efficiency.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/adams23a	Steven Adams, Andrea Patane, Morteza Lahijanian, Luca Laurenti
Comparison of meta-learners for estimating multi-valued treatment heterogeneous effects	Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) estimation is one of the main challenges in causal inference with observational data. In addition to Machine Learning based-models, nonparametric estimators called meta-learners have been developed to estimate the CATE with the main advantage of not restraining the estimation to a specific supervised learning method. This task becomes, however, more complicated when the treatment is not binary as some limitations of the naive extensions emerge. This paper looks into meta-learners for estimating the heterogeneous effects of multi-valued treatments. We consider different meta-learners, and we carry out a theoretical analysis of their error upper bounds as functions of important parameters such as the number of treatment levels, showing that the naive extensions do not always provide satisfactory results. We introduce and discuss meta-learners that perform well as the number of treatments increases. We empirically confirm the strengths and weaknesses of those methods with synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/acharki23a	Naoufal Acharki, Ramiro Lugo, Antoine Bertoncello, Josselin Garnier
Expertise Trees Resolve Knowledge Limitations in Collective Decision-Making	Experts advising decision-makers are likely to display expertise which varies as a function of the problem instance. In practice, this may lead to sub-optimal or discriminatory decisions against minority cases. In this work, we model such changes in depth and breadth of knowledge as a partitioning of the problem space into regions of differing expertise. We provide here new algorithms that explicitly consider and adapt to the relationship between problem instances and experts' knowledge. We first propose and highlight the drawbacks of a naive approach based on nearest neighbor queries. To address these drawbacks we then introduce a novel algorithm — expertise trees — that constructs decision trees enabling the learner to select appropriate models. We provide theoretical insights and empirically validate the improved performance of our novel approach on a range of problems for which existing methods proved to be inadequate.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/abels23a	Axel Abels, Tom Lenaerts, Vito Trianni, Ann Nowe
Toward Large Kernel Models	Recent studies indicate that kernel machines can often perform similarly or better than deep neural networks (DNNs) on small datasets. The interest in kernel machines has been additionally bolstered by the discovery of their equivalence to wide neural networks in certain regimes. However, a key feature of DNNs is their ability to scale the model size and training data size independently, whereas in traditional kernel machines model size is tied to data size. Because of this coupling, scaling kernel machines to large data has been computationally challenging. In this paper, we provide a way forward for constructing large-scale general kernel models, which are a generalization of kernel machines that decouples the model and data, allowing training on large datasets. Specifically, we introduce EigenPro 3.0, an algorithm based on projected dual preconditioned SGD and show scaling to model and data sizes which have not been possible with existing kernel methods. We provide a PyTorch based implementation which can take advantage of multiple GPUs.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/abedsoltan23a	Amirhesam Abedsoltan, Mikhail Belkin, Parthe Pandit
Generalization on the Unseen, Logic Reasoning and Degree Curriculum	This paper considers the learning of logical (Boolean) functions with focus on the generalization on the unseen (GOTU) setting, a strong case of out-of-distribution generalization. This is motivated by the fact that the rich combinatorial nature of data in certain reasoning tasks (e.g., arithmetic/logic) makes representative data sampling challenging, and learning successfully under GOTU gives a first vignette of an 'extrapolating' or 'reasoning' learner. We then study how different network architectures trained by (S)GD perform under GOTU and provide both theoretical and experimental evidence that for a class of network models including instances of Transformers, random features models, and diagonal linear networks, a min-degree-interpolator is learned on the unseen. We also provide evidence that other instances with larger learning rates or mean-field networks reach leaky min-degree solutions. These findings lead to two implications: (1) we provide an explanation to the length generalization problem (e.g., Anil et al. 2022); (2) we introduce a curriculum learning algorithm called Degree-Curriculum that learns monomials more efficiently by incrementing supports.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/abbe23a	Emmanuel Abbe, Samy Bengio, Aryo Lotfi, Kevin Rizk
ClusterFuG: Clustering Fully connected Graphs by Multicut	We propose a graph clustering formulation based on multicut (a.k.a. weighted correlation clustering) on the complete graph. Our formulation does not need specification of the graph topology as in the original sparse formulation of multicut, making our approach simpler and potentially better performing. In contrast to unweighted correlation clustering we allow for a more expressive weighted cost structure. In dense multicut, the clustering objective is given in a factorized form as inner products of node feature vectors. This allows for an efficient formulation and inference in contrast to multicut/weighted correlation clustering, which has at least quadratic representation and computation complexity when working on the complete graph. We show how to rewrite classical greedy algorithms for multicut in our dense setting and how to modify them for greater efficiency and solution quality. In particular, our algorithms scale to graphs with tens of thousands of nodes. Empirical evidence on instance segmentation on Cityscapes and clustering of ImageNet datasets shows the merits of our approach.	https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/abbas23a	Ahmed Abbas, Paul Swoboda
