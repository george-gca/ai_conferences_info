Feriji: A French-Zarma Parallel Corpus, Glossary & Translator	Machine translation (MT) is a rapidly expanding field that has experienced significant advancements in recent years with the development of models capable of translating multiple languages with remarkable accuracy. However, the representation of African languages in this field still needs improvement due to linguistic complexities and limited resources. This applies to the Zarma language, a dialect of Songhay (of the Nilo-Saharan language family) spoken by over 5 million people across Niger and neighboring countries (Lewis et al., 2016). This paper introduces Feriji, the first robust French-Zarma parallel corpus and glossary designed for MT. The corpus, containing 61,085 sentences in Zarma and 42,789 in French, and a glossary of 4,062 words represents a significant step in addressing the need for more resources for Zarma. We fine-tune three large language models on our dataset, obtaining a BLEU score of 30.06 on the best-performing model. We further evaluate the models on human judgments of fluency, comprehension, and readability and the importance and impact of the corpus and models. Our contributions help to bridge a significant language gap and promote an essential and overlooked indigenous African language.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.1	Mamadou Keita, Elysabhete Ibrahim, Habibatou Alfari, Christopher Homan
Z-coref: Thai Coreference and Zero Pronoun Resolution	Coreference Resolution (CR) and Zero Pronoun Resolution (ZPR) are vital for extracting meaningful information from text. However, limited research and datasets pose significant challenges in Thai language. To address this, we developed an annotated joint CR and ZPR dataset. Additionally, we introduced the Z-coref model, capable of simultaneously handling CR and ZPR tasks by adjusting the span definition of a prior CR architecture to include token gaps. The proposed model trained on our dataset outperformed the state-of-the-art in resolving both coreference resolution and zero-pronoun resolution, while taking less time to train.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.12	Poomphob Suwannapichat, Sansiri Tarnpradab, Santitham Prom-on
Automatically Suggesting Diverse Example Sentences for L2 Japanese Learners Using Pre-Trained Language Models	Providing example sentences that are diverse and aligned with learners' proficiency levels is essential for fostering effective language acquisition.This study examines the use of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to produce example sentences targeting L2 Japanese learners.We utilize PLMs in two ways: as quality scoring components in a retrieval system that draws from a newly curated corpus of Japanese sentences, and as direct sentence generators using zero-shot learning.We evaluate the quality of sentences by considering multiple aspects such as difficulty, diversity, and naturalness, with a panel of raters consisting of learners of Japanese, native speakers – and GPT-4.Our findings suggest that there is inherent disagreement among participants on the ratings of sentence qualities, except for difficulty. Despite that, the retrieval approach was preferred by all evaluators, especially for beginner and advanced target proficiency, while the generative approaches received lower scores on average.Even so, our experiments highlight the potential for using PLMs to enhance the adaptability of sentence suggestion systems and therefore improve the language learning journey.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.11	Enrico Benedetti, Akiko Aizawa, Florian Boudin
Document Alignment based on Overlapping Fixed-Length Segments	Acquiring large-scale parallel corpora is crucial for NLP tasks such asNeural Machine Translation, and web crawling has become a popularmethodology for this purpose. Previous studies have been conductedbased on sentence-based segmentation (SBS) when aligning documents invarious languages which are obtained through web crawling. Among them,the TK-PERT method (Thompson and Koehn, 2020) achieved state-of-the-artresults and addressed the boilerplate text in web crawling data wellthrough a down-weighting approach. However, there remains a problemwith how to handle long-text encoding better. Thus, we introduce thestrategy of Overlapping Fixed-Length Segmentation (OFLS) in place ofSBS, and observe a pronounced enhancement when performing the sameapproach for document alignment. In this paper, we compare the SBS andOFLS using three previous methods, Mean-Pool, TK-PERT (Thompson andKoehn, 2020), and Optimal Transport (Clark et al., 2019; El- Kishky andGuzman, 2020), on the WMT16 document alignment shared task forFrench-English, as well as on our self-established Japanese-Englishdataset MnRN. As a result, for the WMT16 task, various SBS basedmethods showed an increase in recall by 1% to 10% after reproductionwith OFLS. For MnRN data, OFLS demonstrated notable accuracyimprovements and exhibited faster document embedding speed.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.10	Xiaotian Wang, Takehito Utsuro, Masaaki Nagata
On the Interpretability of Deep Learning Models for Collaborative Argumentation Analysis in Classrooms	Collaborative argumentation holds significant potential for enhancing students' learning outcomes within classroom settings. Consequently, researchers have explored the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically analyze argumentation in these contexts. Despite the remarkable performance of deep learning models in this task, their lack of interpretability poses a critical challenge, leading to teachers' skepticism and limited utilization. To cultivate trust among teachers, this PhD thesis proposal aims to leverage explainable AI techniques to provide explanations for these deep learning models. Specifically, the study develops two deep learning models for automated analysis of argument moves (claim, evidence, and warrant) and specificity levels (low, medium, and high) within collaborative argumentation. To address the interpretability issue, four explainable AI methods are proposed: gradient sensitivity, gradient input, integrated gradient, and LIME. Computational experiments demonstrate the efficacy of these methods in elucidating model predictions by computing word contributions, with LIME delivering exceptional performance. Moreover, a quasi-experiment is designed to evaluate the impact of model explanations on user trust and knowledge, serving as a future study of this PhD proposal. By tackling the challenges of interpretability and trust, this PhD thesis proposal aims to contribute to fostering user trust in AI and facilitating the practical implementation of AI in educational contexts.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.9	Deliang Wang, Gaowei Chen
MoExtend: Tuning New Experts for Modality and Task Extension	Large language models (LLMs) excel in various tasks but are primarily trained on text data, limiting their application scope. Expanding LLM capabilities to include vision-language understanding is vital, yet training them on multimodal data from scratch is challenging and costly. Existing instruction tuning methods, e.g., LLAVA, often connects a pretrained CLIP vision encoder and LLMs via fully fine-tuning LLMs to bridge the modality gap. However, full fine-tuning is plagued by catastrophic forgetting, i.e., forgetting previous knowledge, and high training costs particularly in the era of increasing tasks and modalities. To solve this issue, we introduce MoExtend, an effective framework designed to streamline the modality adaptation and extension of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. MoExtend seamlessly integrates new experts into pre-trained MoE models, endowing them with novel knowledge without the need to tune pretrained models such as MoE and vision encoders. This approach enables rapid adaptation and extension to new modal data or tasks, effectively addressing the challenge of accommodating new modalities within LLMs. Furthermore, MoExtend avoids tuning pretrained models, thus mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of MoExtend in enhancing the multimodal capabilities of LLMs, contributing to advancements in multimodal AI research.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.8	Shanshan Zhong, Shanghua Gao, Zhongzhan Huang, Wushao Wen, Marinka Zitnik, Pan Zhou
BiasDPO: Mitigating Bias in Language Models through Direct Preference Optimization	Large Language Models (LLMs) have become pivotal in advancing natural language processing, yet their potential to perpetuate biases poses significant concerns. This paper introduces a new framework employing Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate gender, racial, and religious biases in LLM-generated English text. By developing a loss function that favors less biased over biased completions, our approach cultivates a preference for respectful and non-discriminatory language in LLMs. We also contribute a manually designed dataset for training LLMs to recognize and correct biases. This dataset encompasses a diverse range of prompts paired with both biased and unbiased completions. Implementing this approach on the Microsoft Phi-2 model, we demonstrate substantial reductions in biased outputs as our model outperforms the baseline model on almost all bias benchmarks. Our model also achieves better performance compared to other open-source models on most benchmarks. By reducing biases in the language generated by the model, our study marks a significant step towards developing more ethical and socially responsible LLMs. We publicly release BiasDPO dataset on HuggingFace.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.7	Ahmed Allam
InstructCoder: Instruction Tuning Large Language Models for Code Editing	Code editing encompasses a variety of pragmatic tasks that developers deal with daily. Despite its relevance and practical usefulness, automatic code editing remains an underexplored area in the evolution of deep learning models, partly due to data scarcity. In this work, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to edit code based on user instructions. Evaluated on a novel human-written execution-based benchmark dubbed EditEval, we found current models often struggle to fulfill the instructions. In light of this, we contribute InstructCoder, the first instruction-tuning dataset designed to adapt LLMs for general-purpose code editing, containing high-diversity code-editing tasks such as comment insertion, code optimization, and code refactoring. It consists of over 114,000 instruction-input-output triplets and covers multiple distinct code editing scenarios. The collection process starts with filtered commit data sourced from GitHub Python repositories as seeds. Subsequently, the dataset is systematically expanded through an iterative process, where both seed and generated tasks are used to prompt ChatGPT for more data. Our findings reveal that open-source LLMs fine-tuned on InstructCoder can significantly enhance the accuracy of code edits, exhibiting superior code-editing performance matching advanced proprietary LLMs. The datasets and the source code are publicly available.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.6	Kaixin Li, Qisheng Hu, James Zhao, Hui Chen, Yuxi Xie, Tiedong Liu, Michael Shieh, Junxian He
Speech-to-Speech Translation with Discrete-Unit-Based Style Transfer	Direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) with discrete self-supervised representations has achieved remarkable accuracy, but is unable to preserve the speaker timbre of the source speech. Meanwhile, the scarcity of high-quality speaker-parallel data poses a challenge for learning style transfer during translation. We design an S2ST pipeline with style-transfer capability on the basis of discrete self-supervised speech representations and codec units. The acoustic language model we introduce for style transfer leverages self-supervised in-context learning, acquiring style transfer ability without relying on any speaker-parallel data, thereby overcoming data scarcity. By using extensive training data, our model achieves zero-shot cross-lingual style transfer on previously unseen source languages. Experiments show that our model generates translated speeches with high fidelity and speaker similarity.

Can LLMs substitute SQL? Comparing Resource Utilization of Querying LLMs versus Traditional Relational Databases	Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate or substitute different types of tasks in the software engineering process. This study evaluates the resource utilization and accuracy of LLM in interpreting and executing natural language queries against traditional SQL within relational database management systems. We empirically examine the resource utilization and accuracy of nine LLMs varying from 7 to 34 Billion parameters, including Llama2 7B, Llama2 13B, Mistral, Mixtral, Optimus-7B, SUS-chat-34B, platypus-yi-34b, NeuralHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B and Starling-LM-7B-alpha, using a small transaction dataset. Our findings indicate that using LLMs for database queries incurs significant energy overhead (even small and quantized models), making it an environmentally unfriendly approach. Therefore, we advise against replacing relational databases with LLMs due to their substantial resource utilization.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.4	Xiang Zhang, Khatoon Khedri, Reza Rawassizadeh
Topic Modeling for Short Texts with Large Language Models	As conventional topic models rely on word co-occurrence to infer latent topics, topic modeling for short texts has been a long-standing challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) can potentially overcome this challenge by contextually learning the meanings of words via pretraining. In this paper, we study two approaches to using LLMs for topic modeling: parallel prompting and sequential prompting. Input length limitations prevent LLMs from processing many texts at once. However, an arbitrary number of texts can be handled by LLMs by splitting the texts into smaller subsets and processing them in parallel or sequentially. Our experimental results demonstrate that our methods can identify more coherent topics than existing ones while maintaining the diversity of the induced topics. Furthermore, we found that the inferred topics cover the input texts to some extent, while hallucinated topics are hardly generated.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.3	Tomoki Doi, Masaru Isonuma, Hitomi Yanaka
Pragmatic inference of scalar implicature by LLMs	This study investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), engage in pragmatic inference of scalar implicature, such as some. Two sets of experiments were conducted using cosine similarity and next sentence/token prediction as experimental methods. The results in experiment 1 showed that, both models interpret some as pragmatic implicature not all in the absence of context, aligning with human language processing. In experiment 2, in which Question Under Discussion (QUD) was presented as a contextual cue, BERT showed consistent performance regardless of types of QUDs, while GPT-2 encountered processing difficulties since a certain type of QUD required pragmatic inference for implicature. The findings revealed that, in terms of theoretical approaches, BERT inherently incorporates pragmatic implicature not all within the term some, adhering to Default model (Levinson, 2000). In contrast, GPT-2 seems to encounter processing difficulties in inferring pragmatic implicature within context, consistent with Context-driven model (Sperber and Wilson, 2002).	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.2	Ye-eun Cho, Seong mook Kim
STEP: Staged Parameter-Efficient Pre-training for Large Language Models	Pre-training large language models faces significant memory challenges due to the large size of model weights.We propose STaged parameter-Efficient Pre-training (STEP), which combines ideas from parameter-efficient tuning and staged training. We conduct experiments on pre-training models of various sizes and demonstrate that STEP can achieve up to a 40.4% reduction in maximum memory requirement compared to vanilla pre-training while maintaining comparable performance.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.50	Kazuki Yano, Takumi Ito, Jun Suzuki
LlamaFactory: Unified Efficient Fine-Tuning of 100+ Language Models	Efficient fine-tuning is vital for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. However, it requires non-trivial efforts to implement these methods on different models. We present LlamaFactory, a unified framework that integrates a suite of cutting-edge efficient training methods. It provides a solution for flexibly customizing the fine-tuning of 100+ LLMs without the need for coding through the built-in web UI LlamaBoard. We empirically validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our framework on language modeling and text generation tasks. It has been released at https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory and received over 25,000 stars and 3,000 forks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.38	Yaowei Zheng, Richong Zhang, Junhao Zhang, YeYanhan YeYanhan, Zheyan Luo
RAM-EHR: Retrieval Augmentation Meets Clinical Predictions on Electronic Health Records	We present RAM-EHR, a Retrieval AugMentation pipeline to improve clinical predictions on Electronic Health Records (EHRs). RAM-EHR first collects multiple knowledge sources, converts them into text format, and uses dense retrieval to obtain information related to medical concepts. This strategy addresses the difficulties associated with complex names for the concepts. RAM-EHR then augments the local EHR predictive model co-trained with consistency regularization to capture complementary information from patient visits and summarized knowledge. Experiments on two EHR datasets show the efficacy of RAM-EHR over previous knowledge-enhanced baselines (3.4% gain in AUROC and 7.2% gain in AUPR), emphasizing the effectiveness of the summarized knowledge from RAM-EHR for clinical prediction tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.68	Ran Xu, Wenqi Shi, Yue Yu, Yuchen Zhuang, Bowen Jin, May Dongmei Wang, Joyce Ho, Carl Yang
IAPT: Instance-Aware Prompt Tuning for Large Language Models	Soft prompt tuning is a widely studied parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, it has a clear drawback: many soft tokens must be inserted into the input sequences to guarantee downstream performance. As a result, soft prompt tuning is less considered than Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) in the large language modeling (LLM) era. In this work, we propose a novel prompt tuning method, Instruction-Aware Prompt Tuning (IAPT), that requires only four soft tokens. First, we install a parameter-efficient soft prompt generator at each Transformer layer to generate idiosyncratic soft prompts for each input instruction. The generated soft prompts can be seen as a semantic summary of the input instructions and can effectively guide the output generation. Second, the soft prompt generators are modules with a bottleneck architecture consisting of a self-attention pooling operation, two linear projections, and an activation function. Pilot experiments show that prompt generators at different Transformer layers require different activation functions. Thus, we propose to learn the idiosyncratic activation functions for prompt generators automatically with the help of rational functions. We have conducted experiments on various tasks, and the experimental results demonstrate that (a) our IAPT method can outperform the recent baselines with comparable tunable parameters. (b) Our IAPT method is more efficient than LoRA under the single-backbone multi-tenant setting.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.771	Wei Zhu, Aaron Tian, Congrui Yin, Yuan Ni, Xiaoling Wang, Guotong Xie
Detecting Machine-Generated Text: Techniques and Challenges	As AI-generated text increasingly resembles human-written content, the ability to detect machine-generated text becomes crucial in many applications. This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive overview of text detection techniques, focusing on machine-generated text and deepfakes. We will discuss various methods for distinguishing between human-written and machine-generated text, including statistical methods, neural network-based techniques, and hybrid approaches. The tutorial will also cover the challenges in the detection process, such as dealing with evolving models and maintaining robustness against adversarial attacks. By the end of the session, attendees will have a solid understanding of current techniques and future directions in the field of text detection.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-tutorials.6	Li Gao, Wenhan Xiong, Taewoo Kim
Vulnerabilities of Large Language Models to Adversarial Attacks	This tutorial serves as a comprehensive guide on the vulnerabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to adversarial attacks, an interdisciplinary field that blends perspectives from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Cybersecurity. As LLMs become more complex and integrated into various systems, understanding their security attributes is crucial. However, current research indicates that even safety-aligned models are not impervious to adversarial attacks that can result in incorrect or harmful outputs. The tutorial first lays the foundation by explaining safety-aligned LLMs and concepts in cybersecurity. It then categorizes existing research based on different types of learning architectures and attack methods. We highlight the existing vulnerabilities of unimodal LLMs, multi-modal LLMs, and systems that integrate LLMs, focusing on adversarial attacks designed to exploit weaknesses and mislead AI systems. Finally, the tutorial delves into the potential causes of these vulnerabilities and discusses potential defense mechanisms.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-tutorials.5	Yu Fu, Erfan Shayegan, Md.

Presentation Matters: How to Communicate Science in the NLP Venues and in the Wild?	Each year a large number of early career researchers join the NLP/Computational Linguistics community, with most starting by presenting their research in the *ACL conferences and workshops. While writing a paper that has made it to these venues is one important step, what comes with communicating the outcome is equally important and sets the path to impact of a research outcome. In addition, not all PhD candidates get the chance of being trained for their presentation skills. Research methods courses are not all of the same quality and may not cover scientific communications, and certainly not all are tailored to the NLP community. We are proposing an introductory tutorial that covers a range of different communication skills, including writing, oral presentation (posters and demos), and social media presence. This is to fill in the gap for the researchers who may not have access to research methods courses or other mentors who could help them acquire such skills. The interactive nature of such a tutorial would allow attendees to ask questions and clarifications which would not be possible from reading materials alone.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-tutorials.4	Sarvnaz Karimi, Cecile Paris, Gholamreza Haffari
Computational Expressivity of Neural Language Models	Language models (LMs) are currently at the forefront of NLP researchdue to their remarkable versatility across diverse tasks. However, a largegap exists between their observed capabilities and the explanations proposedby established formal machinery. To motivate a better theoreticalcharacterization of LMs' abilities and limitations, this tutorial aims toprovide a comprehensive introduction to a specific framework for formalanalysis of modern LMs using tools from formal language theory (FLT). Wepresent how tools from FLT can be useful in understanding the inner workingsand predicting the capabilities of modern neural LM architectures. We willcover recent results using FLT to make precise and practically relevantstatements about LMs based on recurrent neural networks and transformers byrelating them to formal devices such as finite-state automata, Turingmachines, and analog circuits. Altogether, the results covered in thistutorial will allow us to make precise statements and explanations about theobserved as well as predicted behaviors of LMs, as well as providetheoretically motivated suggestions on the aspects of the architectures thatcould be improved.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-tutorials.3	Alexandra Butoi, Ryan Cotterell, Anej Svete
Automatic and Human-AI Interactive Text Generation (with a focus on Text Simplification and Revision)	In this tutorial, we focus on text-to-text generation, a class ofnatural language generation (NLG) tasks, that takes a piece of text as inputand then generates a revision that is improved according to some specificcriteria (e.g., readability or linguistic styles), while largely retainingthe original meaning and the length of the text. This includes many usefulapplications, such as text simplification, paraphrase generation, styletransfer, etc. In contrast to text summarization and open-ended textcompletion (e.g., story), the text-to-text generation tasks we discuss inthis tutorial are more constrained in terms of semantic consistency andtargeted language styles. This level of control makes these tasks idealtestbeds for studying the ability of models to generate text that is bothsemantically adequate and stylistically appropriate. Moreover, these tasksare interesting from a technical standpoint, as they require complexcombinations of lexical and syntactical transformations, stylistic control,and adherence to factual knowledge, – all at once. With a special focus ontext simplification and revision, this tutorial aims to provide an overviewof the state-of-the-art natural language generation research from four majoraspects – Data, Models, Human-AI Collaboration, and Evaluation – and todiscuss and showcase a few significant and recent advances: (1) the use ofnon-retrogressive approaches; (2) the shift from fine-tuning to promptingwith large language models; (3) the development of new learnable metric andfine-grained human evaluation framework; (4) a growing body of studies anddatasets on non-English languages; (5) the rise of HCI+NLP+Accessibilityinterdisciplinary research to create real-world writing assistant systems.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-tutorials.2	Yao Dou, Philippe Laban, Claire Gardent, Wei Xu
Computational Linguistics for Brain Encoding and Decoding: Principles, Practices and Beyond	Computational linguistics (CL) has witnessed tremendous advancementsin recent years, with models such as large language models demonstratingexceptional performance in various natural language processing tasks. Theseadvancements highlight their potential to help understand brain languageprocessing, especially through the lens of brain encoding and decoding.Brain encoding involves the mapping of linguistic stimuli to brain activity,while brain decoding is the process of reconstructing linguistic stimulifrom observed brain activities. CL models that excel at capturing andmanipulating linguistic features are crucial for mapping linguistic stimulito brain activities and vice versa. Brain encoding and decoding have vastapplications, from enhancing human-computer interaction to developingassistive technologies for individuals with communication impairments. Thistutorial will focus on elucidating how computational linguistics canfacilitate brain encoding and decoding. We will delve into the principlesand practices of using computational linguistics methods for brain encodingand decoding. We will also discuss the challenges and future directions ofbrain encoding and decoding.

Confabulation: The Surprising Value of Large Language Model Hallucinations	This paper presents a systematic defense of large language model (LLM) hallucinations or 'confabulations' as a potential resource instead of a categorically negative pitfall. The standard view is that confabulations are inherently problematic and AI research should eliminate this flaw. In this paper, we argue and empirically demonstrate that measurable semantic characteristics of LLM confabulations mirror a human propensity to utilize increased narrativity as a cognitive resource for sense-making and communication. In other words, it has potential value. Specifically, we analyze popular hallucination benchmarks and reveal that hallucinated outputs display increased levels of narrativity and semantic coherence relative to veridical outputs. This finding reveals a tension in our usually dismissive understandings of confabulation. It suggests, counter-intuitively, that the tendency for LLMs to confabulate may be intimately associated with a positive capacity for coherent narrative-text generation.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.770	Peiqi Sui, Eamon Duede, Sophie Wu, Richard So
Superfiltering: Weak-to-Strong Data Filtering for Fast Instruction-Tuning	Instruction tuning is critical to improve LLMs but usually suffers from low-quality and redundant data. Data filtering for instruction tuning has proved important in improving both the efficiency and performance of the tuning process. But it also leads to extra cost and computation due to the involvement of LLMs in this process. To reduce the filtering cost, we study Superfiltering: Can we use a smaller and weaker model to select data for finetuning a larger and stronger model? Despite the performance gap between weak and strong language models, we find their highly consistent capability to perceive instruction difficulty and data selection results. This enables us to use a much smaller and more efficient model to filter the instruction data used to train a larger language model. Not only does it largely speed up the data filtering, but the filtered-data-finetuned LLM achieves even better performance on standard benchmarks. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy and efficiency of our approach.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.769	Ming Li, Yong Zhang, Shwai He, Zhitao Li, Hongyu Zhao, Jianzong Wang, Ning Cheng, Tianyi Zhou
LogogramNLP: Comparing Visual and Textual Representations of Ancient Logographic Writing Systems for NLP	Standard natural language processing (NLP) pipelines operate on symbolic representations of language, which typically consist of sequences of discrete tokens. However, creating an analogous representation for ancient logographic writing systems is an extremely labor-intensive process that requires expert knowledge. At present, a large portion of logographic data persists in a purely visual form due to the absence of transcription—this issue poses a bottleneck for researchers seeking to apply NLP toolkits to study ancient logographic languages: most of the relevant data are images of writing. This paper investigates whether direct processing of visual representations of language offers a potential solution. We introduce LogogramNLP, the first benchmark enabling NLP analysis of ancient logographic languages, featuring both transcribed and visual datasetsfor four writing systems along with annotations for tasks like classification, translation, and parsing. Our experiments compare systems thatemploy recent visual and text encoding strategies as backbones. The results demonstrate that visual representations outperform textual representations for some investigated tasks, suggesting that visual processing pipelines may unlock a large amount of cultural heritage data of logographic languages for NLP-based analyses.

Controlled Text Generation for Black-box Language Models via Score-based Progressive Editor	Controlled text generation, aiming to ensure that language models produce text containing only the desired domain or corpus attributes, is immensely crucial in the practical application of language models. Existing methods, however, are inapplicable to black-box models or suffer a significant trade-off between control and fluency in text generation. This paper introduces the Score-based Progressive Editor (ScoPE), a novel approach designed to overcome these issues. ScoPE modifies the context at the token level during the generation process of a backbone language model. This modification guides the subsequent text to naturally include the target attributes. To facilitate this process, ScoPE employs a training objective that maximizes a target score, comprehensively considering both control and fluency. Experimental results on diverse controlled generation tasks demonstrate that ScoPE can effectively regulate the attributes of the generated text while effectively utilizing the capability of the backbone large language models.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.767	Sangwon Yu, Changmin Lee, Hojin Lee, Sungroh Yoon
Multistage Collaborative Knowledge Distillation from a Large Language Model for Semi-Supervised Sequence Generation	We study semi-supervised sequence generation tasks, where the few labeled examples are too scarce to finetune a model, and meanwhile, few-shot prompted large language models (LLMs) exhibit room for improvement. In this paper, we present the discovery that a student model distilled from a few-shot prompted LLM can commonly generalize better than its teacher to unseen examples on such tasks. We find that the student is able to learn a general pattern from the high-quality pseudolabels produced by the teacher during knowledge distillation (KD), and favorably not a general pattern from the low-quality pseudolabels. Leveraging this discovery, we propose a new method, Multistage Collaborative Knowledge Distillation from an LLM (MCKD), for these tasks. MCKD first few-shot prompts an LLM to produce pseudolabels for unlabeled data. Then at each stage of an iterative KD process, a new pair of students is trained on disjoint partitions of the pseudolabeled data, and produces new and improved pseudolabels for their unseen partitions. We conduct extensive experiments on four syntactic and semantic parsing datasets and show the effectiveness of MCKD for low-resource semi-supervised sequence generation. On CRAFT biomedical parsing, for example, 3-stage MCKD with 50 labeled examples outperforms an LLM teacher and vanilla KD by 7.5% and 3.7% parsing F1, respectively, and matches the performance of supervised finetuning with 500 labeled examples.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.766	Jiachen Zhao, Wenlong Zhao, Andrew Drozdov, Benjamin Rozonoyer, Md Arafat Sultan, Jay-Yoon Lee, Mohit Iyyer, Andrew McCallum
Multi-modal Preference Alignment Remedies Degradation of Visual Instruction Tuning on Language Models	Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to support multi-turn queries of interchanging image and text modalities in production. However, the current MLLMs trained with visual-question-answering (VQA) datasets could suffer from degradation, as VQA datasets lack the diversity and complexity of the original text instruction datasets with which the underlying language model was trained. To address this degradation, we first collect a lightweight, 5k-sample VQA preference dataset where answers were annotated by Gemini for five quality metrics in a granular fashion and investigate standard Supervised Fine-tuning, rejection sampling, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and SteerLM algorithms. Our findings indicate that with DPO, we can surpass the instruction-following capabilities of the language model, achieving a 6.73 score on MT-Bench, compared to Vicuna's 6.57 and LLaVA's 5.99. This enhancement in textual instruction-following capability correlates with boosted visual instruction performance (+4.9% on MM-Vet, +6% on LLaVA-Bench), with minimal alignment tax on visual knowledge benchmarks compared to the previous RLHF approach. In conclusion, we propose a distillation-based multi-modal alignment model with fine-grained annotations on a small dataset that restores and boosts MLLM's language capability after visual instruction tuning.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.765	Shengzhi Li, Rongyu Lin, Shichao Pei
EWEK-QA : Enhanced Web and Efficient Knowledge Graph Retrieval for Citation-based Question Answering Systems	The emerging citation-based QA systems are gaining more attention especially in generative AI search applications. The importance of extracted knowledge provided to these systems is vital from both accuracy (completeness of information) and efficiency (extracting the information in a timely manner). In this regard, citation-based QA systems are suffering from two shortcomings. First, they usually rely only on web as a source of extracted knowledge and adding other external knowledge sources can hamper the efficiency of the system. Second, web-retrieved contents are usually obtained by some simple heuristics such as fixed length or breakpoints which might lead to splitting information into pieces. To mitigate these issues, we propose our enhanced web and efficient knowledge graph (KG) retrieval solution (EWEK-QA) to enrich the content of the extracted knowledge fed to the system. This has been done through designing an adaptive web retriever and incorporating KGs triples in an efficient manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of over the open-source state-of-the-art (SoTA) web-based and KG baseline models using a comprehensive set of quantitative and human evaluation experiments. Our model is able to: first, improve the web-retriever baseline in terms of extracting more relevant passages (>20%), the coverage of answer span (>25%) and self containment (>35%); second, obtain and integrate KG triples into its pipeline very efficiently (by avoiding any LLM calls) to outperform the web-only and KG-only SoTA baselines significantly in 7 quantitative QA tasks and our human evaluation.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.764	Mohammad Dehghan, Mohammad Alomrani, Sunyam Bagga, David Alfonso-Hermelo, Khalil Bibi, Abbas Ghaddar, Yingxue Zhang, Xiaoguang Li, Jianye Hao, Qun Liu, Jimmy Lin, Boxing Chen, Prasanna Parthasarathi, Mahdi Biparva, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh
Tracking the Newsworthiness of Public Documents	"Journalists regularly make decisions on whether or not to report stories, based on ""news values"". In this work, we wish to explicitly model these decisions to explore _when_ and _why_ certain stories get press attention. This is challenging because very few labelled links between source documents and news articles exist and language use between corpora is very different. We address this problem by implementing a novel _probabilistic relational modeling_ framework, which we show is a low-annotation linking methodology that outperforms other, more state-of-the-art retrieval-based baselines. Next, we define a new task: __newsworthiness prediction__, to predict if a policy item will get covered. We focus on news coverage of local public policy in the San Francisco Bay Area by the _San Francisco Chronicle_. We gather 15k policies discussed across 10 years of public policy meetings, and transcribe over 3,200 hours of public discussion. In general, we find limited impact of public discussion on newsworthiness prediction accuracy, suggesting that some of the most important stories barely get discussed in public.Finally, we show that newsworthiness predictions can be a useful assistive tool for journalists seeking to keep abreast of local government. We perform human evaluation with expert journalists and show our systems identify policies they consider newsworthy with 68% F1 and our coverage recommendations are helpful with an 84% win-rate against baseline. We release all code and data to our work here: https://github.com/alex2awesome/newsworthiness-public."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.763	Alexander Spangher, Serdar Tumgoren, Ben Welsh, Nanyun Peng, Emilio Ferrara, Jonathan May
Language Models are Homer Simpson! Safety Re-Alignment of Fine-tuned Language Models through Task Arithmetic	We propose RESTA to perform LLM realignment towards safety, which gets compromised due to downstream task fine-tuning. RESTA stands for REstoring Safety through Task Arithmetic. At its core, it involves a simple arithmetic addition of a safety vector to the weights of the compromised model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RESTA in both parameter-efficient and full fine-tuning, covering a wide range of downstream tasks, including instruction following in Chinese, English, and Hindi, as well as problem-solving capabilities in Code and Math. We also showcase the generalizability of RESTA on three existing safety evaluation benchmarks and a multilingual benchmark dataset proposed as a part of this work, consisting of 550 harmful questions covering 11 categories, each with 5 sub-categories of harm. Overall, RESTA decreases the harmfulness of the compromised model from 18.6% to 5.1% and from 9.2% to 1.5% in parameter-efficient and full fine-tuning, respectively, while maintaining most of the model's performance on the task. We release the source codes at: https://github.com/declare-lab/resta.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.762	Rishabh Bhardwaj, Duc Anh Do, Soujanya Poria
Quantifying Contamination in Evaluating Code Generation Capabilities of Language Models	While large language models have achieved remarkable performance on various code generation benchmarks, there have been growing concerns regarding potential contamination of these benchmarks as they may be leaked into pretraining and finetuning data. While recent work has investigated contamination in natural language generation and understanding tasks, there has been less extensive research into how data contamination impacts the evaluation of code generation, which is critical for understanding the robustness and reliability of LLMs in programming contexts. In this work, we perform a comprehensive study of data contamination of popular code generation benchmarks, and precisely quantify their overlap with pretraining corpus through both surface-level and semantic-level matching. In our experiments, we show that there are substantial overlap between popular code generation benchmarks and open training corpus, and models perform significantly better on the subset of the benchmarks where similar solutions are seen during training. We also conduct extensive analysis on the factors that affect model memorization and generalization, such as model size, problem difficulty, and question length. We release all resulting files from our matching pipeline for future research.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.761	Martin Riddell, Ansong Ni, Arman Cohan
GPT is Not an Annotator: The Necessity of Human Annotation in Fairness Benchmark Construction	Social biases in LLMs are usually measured via bias benchmark datasets. Current benchmarks have limitations in scope, grounding, quality, and human effort required. Previous work has shown success with a community-sourced, rather than crowd-sourced, approach to benchmark development. However, this work still required considerable effort from annotators with relevant lived experience. This paper explores whether an LLM (specifically, GPT-3.5-Turbo) can assist with the task of developing a bias benchmark dataset from responses to an open-ended community survey. We also extend the previous work to a new community and set of biases: the Jewish community and antisemitism. Our analysis shows that GPT-3.5-Turbo has poor performance on this annotation task and produces unacceptable quality issues in its output. Thus, we conclude that GPT-3.5-Turbo is not an appropriate substitute for human annotation in sensitive tasks related to social biases, and that its use actually negates many of the benefits of community-sourcing bias benchmarks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.760	Virginia Felkner, Jennifer Thompson, Jonathan May
Representation Learning with Conditional Information Flow Maximization	This paper proposes an information-theoretic representation learning framework, named conditional information flow maximization, to extract noise-invariant sufficient representations for the input data and target task. It promotes the learned representations have good feature uniformity and sufficient predictive ability, which can enhance the generalization of pre-trained language models (PLMs) for the target task. Firstly, an information flow maximization principle is proposed to learn more sufficient representations for the input and target by simultaneously maximizing both input-representation and representation-label mutual information. Unlike the information bottleneck, we handle the input-representation information in an opposite way to avoid the over-compression issue of latent representations. Besides, to mitigate the negative effect of potential redundant features from the input, we design a conditional information minimization principle to eliminate negative redundant features while preserve noise-invariant features. Experiments on 13 language understanding benchmarks demonstrate that our method effectively improves the performance of PLMs for classification and regression. Extensive experiments show that the learned representations are more sufficient, robust and transferable.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.759	Dou Hu, Lingwei Wei, Wei Zhou, Songlin Hu
DeCoT: Debiasing Chain-of-Thought for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks in Large Language Models via Causal Intervention	Large language models (LLMs) often require task-relevant knowledge to augment their internal knowledge through prompts. However, simply injecting external knowledge into prompts does not guarantee that LLMs can identify and use relevant information in the prompts to conduct chain-of-thought reasoning, especially when the LLM's internal knowledge is derived from biased information on the pretraining data. In this paper, we propose a novel causal view to formally explain the internal knowledge bias of LLMs via a Structural Causal Model (SCM). We review the chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting from a causal perspective and discover that the biased information from pretrained models can impair LLMs' reasoning abilities. When the CoT reasoning paths are misled by irrelevant information from prompts and are logically incorrect, simply editing factual information is insufficient to reach the correct answer. To estimate the confounding effect on CoT reasoning in LLMs, we use external knowledge as an instrumental variable. We further introduce CoT as a mediator to conduct front-door adjustment and generate logically correct CoTs where the spurious correlation between LLMs' pretrained knowledge and task queries is reduced. With extensive experiments, we validate that our approach enables more accurate CoT reasoning and enhances LLM generation on knowledge-intensive tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.758	Junda Wu, Tong Yu, Xiang Chen, Haoliang Wang, Ryan Rossi, Sungchul Kim, Anup Rao, Julian McAuley
Rephrasing the Web: A Recipe for Compute and Data-Efficient Language Modeling	"Large language models are trained on massive scrapes of the web, which are often unstructured, noisy, and poorly phrased. Current scaling laws show that learning from such data requires an abundance of both compute and data, which grows with the size of the model being trained. This is infeasible both because of the large compute costs and duration associated with pre-training, and the impending scarcity of high-quality data on the web. In this work, we propose Web Rephrase Augmented Pre-training (WRAP) that uses an off-the-shelf instruction-tuned model prompted to paraphrase documents on the web in specific styles such as ""like Wikipedia"" or in ""question-answer format"" to jointly pre-train LLMs on real and synthetic rephrases. First, we show that using WRAP on the C4 dataset, which is naturally noisy, speeds up pre-training by ~3x. At the same pre-training compute budget, it improves perplexity by more than 50% on average across different subsets of the Pile, and improves zero-shot question answer accuracy across 13 tasks by more than 2%. Second, we investigate the impact of the re-phrasing style on the performance of the model, offering insights into how the composition of the training data can impact the performance of LLMs in OOD settings. Our gains are attributed to the fact that re-phrased synthetic data has higher utility than just real data because it (i) incorporates style diversity that closely reflects downstream evaluation style, and (ii) has higher 'quality' than web-scraped data."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.757	Pratyush Maini, Skyler Seto, Richard Bai, David Grangier, Yizhe Zhang, Navdeep Jaitly
What is the Best Way for ChatGPT to Translate Poetry?	Machine translation (MT) has historically faced significant challenges when applied to literary works, particularly in the domain of poetry translation. The advent of Large Language Models such as ChatGPT holds potential for innovation in this field. This study examines ChatGPT's capabilities in English-Chinese poetry translation tasks, utilizing targeted prompts and small sample scenarios to ascertain optimal performance. Despite promising outcomes, our analysis reveals persistent issues in the translations generated by ChatGPT that warrant attention. To address these shortcomings, we propose an Explanation-Assisted Poetry Machine Translation (EAPMT) method, which leverages monolingual poetry explanation as a guiding information for the translation process. Furthermore, we refine existing evaluation criteria to better suit the nuances of modern poetry translation. We engaged a panel of professional poets for assessments, complemented evaluations by using GPT-4. The results from both human and machine evaluations demonstrate that our EAPMT method outperforms traditional translation methods of ChatGPT and the existing online systems. This paper validates the efficacy of our method and contributes a novel perspective to machine-assisted literary translation.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.756	Shanshan Wang, Derek Wong, Jingming Yao, Lidia Chao
Explanation-aware Soft Ensemble Empowers Large Language Model In-context Learning	"Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various natural language understanding tasks with a few demonstration examples via in-context learning. Common strategies to boost such ""in-context"" learning ability are to ensemble multiple model decoded results and require the model to generate an explanation along with the prediction. However, these models often treat different class predictions equally and neglect the potential discrepancy between the explanations and predictions. To fully unleash the power of explanations, we propose EASE, an Explanation-Aware Soft Ensemble framework to empower in-context learning with LLMs. We design two techniques, explanation-guided ensemble, and soft probability aggregation, to mitigate the effect of unreliable explanations and improve the consistency between explanations and final predictions. Experiments on seven natural language understanding tasks and four varying-size LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.755	Yue Yu, Jiaming Shen, Tianqi Liu, Zhen Qin, Jing Nathan Yan, Jialu Liu, Chao Zhang, Michael Bendersky
Fora: A corpus and framework for the study of facilitated dialogue	Facilitated dialogue is increasingly popular as a method of civic engagement and as a method for gathering social insight, but resources for its study are scant. We present Fora, a unique collection of annotated facilitated dialogues. We compile 262 facilitated conversations that were hosted with partner organizations seeking to engage their members and surface insights regarding issues like education, elections, and public health, primarily through the sharing of personal experience. Alongside this corpus of 39,911 speaker turns, we present a framework for the analysis of facilitated dialogue. We taxonomize key personal sharing behaviors and facilitation strategies in the corpus, annotate a 25% sample (10,000+ speaker turns) of the data accordingly, and evaluate and establish baselines on a number of tasks essential to the identification of these phenomena in dialogue. We describe the data, and relate facilitator behavior to turn-taking and participant sharing. We outline how this research can inform future work in understanding and improving facilitated dialogue, parsing spoken conversation, and improving the behavior of dialogue agents.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.754	Hope Schroeder, Deb Roy, Jad Kabbara
Transparent and Scrutable Recommendations Using Natural Language User Profiles	Recent state-of-the-art recommender systems predominantly rely on either implicit or explicit feedback from users to suggest new items. While effective in recommending novel options, many recommender systems often use uninterpretable embeddings to represent user preferences. This lack of transparency not only limits user understanding of why certain items are suggested but also reduces the user's ability to scrutinize and modify their preferences, thereby affecting their ability to receive a list of preferred recommendations. Given the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we investigate how a properly crafted prompt can be used to summarize a user's preferences from past reviews and recommend items based only on language-based preferences. In particular, we study how LLMs can be prompted to generate a natural language (NL) user profile that holistically describe a user's preferences. These NL profiles can then be leveraged to fine-tune a LLM using only NL profiles to make transparent and scrutable recommendations. Furthermore, we validate the scrutability of our user profile-based recommender by investigating the impact on recommendation changes after editing NL user profiles. According to our evaluations of the model's rating prediction performance on two benchmarking rating prediction datasets, we observe that this novel approach maintains a performance level on par with established recommender systems in a warm-start setting. With a systematic analysis into the effect of updating user profiles and system prompts, we show the advantage of our approach in easier adjustment of user preferences and a greater autonomy over users' received recommendations.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.753	Jerome Ramos, Hossein A.

The MERSA Dataset and a Transformer-Based Approach for Speech Emotion Recognition	Research in the field of speech emotion recognition (SER) relies on the availability of comprehensive datasets to make it possible to design accurate emotion detection models. This study introduces the Multimodal Emotion Recognition and Sentiment Analysis (MERSA) dataset, which includes both natural and scripted speech recordings, transcribed text, physiological data, and self-reported emotional surveys from 150 participants collected over a two-week period. This work also presents a novel emotion recognition approach that uses a transformer-based model, integrating pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 and BERT for feature extractions and additional LSTM layers to learn hidden representations from fused representations from speech and text. Our model predicts emotions on dimensions of arousal, valence, and dominance. We trained and evaluated the model on the MSP-PODCAST dataset and achieved competitive results from the best-performing model regarding the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). Further, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this model through cross-domain evaluations on both IEMOCAP and MERSA datasets.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.752	Enshi Zhang, Rafael Trujillo, Christian Poellabauer
Skin-in-the-Game: Decision Making via Multi-Stakeholder Alignment in LLMs	Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in tasks such as summarization, arithmetic reasoning, and question answering. However, they encounter significant challenges in the domain of moral reasoning and ethical decision-making, especially in complex scenarios with multiple stakeholders. This paper introduces the Skin-in-the-Game (SKIG) framework, aimed at enhancing moral reasoning in LLMs by exploring decisions' consequences from multiple stakeholder perspectives. The core components of the framework consist of simulating accountability for decisions, conducting empathy exercises on different stakeholders, and evaluating the risks associated with the impacts of potential actions. We study SKIG's performance across various moral reasoning benchmarks with proprietary and open-source LLMs, and investigate its crucial components through extensive ablation analyses. Our framework exhibits marked improvements in performance compared to baselines across different language models and benchmarks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.751	Bilgehan Sel, Priya Shanmugasundaram, Mohammad Kachuee, Kun Zhou, Ruoxi Jia, Ming Jin
Impacts of Misspelled Queries on Translation and Product Search	Machine translation is used in e-commerce to translate second-language queries into the primary language of the store, to be matched by the search system against the product catalog. However, many queries contain spelling mistakes. We first present an analysis of the spelling-robustness of a population of MT systems, quantifying how spelling variations affect MT output, the list of returned products, and ultimately user behavior. We then present two sets of practical experiments illustrating how spelling-robustness may be specifically improved. For MT, reducing the number of BPE operations significantly improves spelling-robustness in six language pairs. In end-to-end e-commerce, the inclusion of a dedicated spelling correction model, and the augmentation of that model's training data with language-relevant phenomena, each improve robustness and consistency of search results.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.750	Greg Hanneman, Natawut Monaikul, Taichi Nakatani
NEO-BENCH: Evaluating Robustness of Large Language Models with Neologisms	The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) degrades from the temporal drift between data used for model training and newer text seen during inference. One understudied avenue of language change causing data drift is the emergence of neologisms – new word forms – over time. We create a diverse resource of recent English neologisms by using several popular collection methods. We analyze temporal drift using neologisms by comparing sentences containing new words with near-identical sentences that replace neologisms with existing substitute words. Model performance is nearly halved in machine translation when a single neologism is introduced in a sentence. Motivated by these results, we construct a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to generalize to neologisms with various natural language understanding tasks and model perplexity. Models with later knowledge cutoff dates yield lower perplexities and perform better in downstream tasks. LLMs are also affected differently based on the linguistic origins of words, indicating that neologisms are complex for static LLMs to address. We will release our benchmark and code for reproducing our experiments.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.749	Jonathan Zheng, Alan Ritter, Wei Xu
Prototypical Reward Network for Data-Efficient Model Alignment	The reward model for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper explores enhancing RLHF with Prototypical Networks to improve reward models. We propose a framework utilizing Prototypical Networks to enhance reward models under limited human feedback, enabling more stable and reliable structural learning from fewer samples. This enhances the model's adaptability and accuracy in interpreting human preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the performance of reward models and LLMs in human feedback tasks, surpassing traditional methods, especially in data-limited scenarios.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.748	Jinghan Zhang, Xiting Wang, Yiqiao Jin, Changyu Chen, Xinhao Zhang, Kunpeng Liu
Evaluating Very Long-Term Conversational Memory of LLM Agents	Existing works on long-term open-domain dialogues focus on evaluating model responses within contexts spanning no more than five chat sessions. Despite advancements in long-context large language models (LLMs) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques, their efficacy in very long-term dialogues remains unexplored. To address this research gap, we introduce a machine-human pipeline to generate high-quality, very long-term dialogues by leveraging LLM-based agent architectures and grounding their dialogues on personas and temporal event graphs. Moreover, we equip each agent with the capability of sharing and reacting to images. The generated conversations are verified and edited by human annotators for long-range consistency and grounding to the event graphs. Using this pipeline, we collect LoCoMo, a dataset of very long-term conversations, each encompassing 600 turns and 16K tokens on avg., over up to 32 sessions. Based on LoCoMo, we present a comprehensive evaluation benchmark to measure long-term memory in models, encompassing question answering, event summarization, and multi-modal dialogue generation tasks. Our experimental results indicate that LLMs exhibit challenges in understanding lengthy conversations and comprehending long-range temporal and causal dynamics within dialogues. Employing strategies like long-context LLMs or RAG can offer improvements but these models still substantially lag behind human performance.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.747	Adyasha Maharana, Dong-Ho Lee, Sergey Tulyakov, Mohit Bansal, Francesco Barbieri, Yuwei Fang
LIEDER: Linguistically-Informed Evaluation for Discourse Entity Recognition	Discourse Entity (DE) recognition is the task of identifying novel and known entities introduced within a text. While previous work has found that large language models have basic, if imperfect, DE recognition abilities (Schuster and Linzen, 2022), it remains largely unassessed which of the fundamental semantic properties that govern the introduction and subsequent reference to DEs they have knowledge of. We propose the Linguistically-Informed Evaluation for Discourse Entity Recognition (LIEDER) dataset that allows for a detailed examination of language models' knowledge of four crucial semantic properties: existence, uniqueness, plurality, and novelty. We find evidence that state-of-the-art large language models exhibit sensitivity to all of these properties except novelty, which demonstrates that they have yet to reach human-level language understanding abilities.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.746	Xiaomeng Zhu, Robert Frank
LLM-Rubric: A Multidimensional, Calibrated Approach to Automated Evaluation of Natural Language Texts	This paper introduces a framework for the automated evaluation of natural language texts. A manually constructed rubric describes how to assess multiple dimensions of interest. To evaluate a text, a large language model (LLM) is prompted with each rubric question and produces a distribution over potential responses. The LLM predictions often fail to agree well with human judges—indeed, the humans do not fully agree with one another. However, the multiple LLM distributions can be _combined_ to _predict_ each human judge's annotations on all questions, including a summary question that assesses overall quality or relevance. LLM-Rubric accomplishes this by training a small feed-forward neural network that includes both judge-specific and judge-independent parameters. When evaluating dialogue systems in a human-AI information-seeking task, we find that LLM-Rubric with 9 questions (assessing dimensions such as naturalness, conciseness, and citation quality) predicts human judges' assessment of overall user satisfaction, on a scale of 1–4, with RMS error < 0.5, a 2× improvement over the uncalibrated baseline.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.745	Helia Hashemi, Jason Eisner, Corby Rosset, Benjamin Van Durme, Chris Kedzie
When Benchmarks are Targets: Revealing the Sensitivity of Large Language Model Leaderboards	Large Language Model (LLM) leaderboards based on benchmark rankings are regularly used to guide practitioners in model selection. Often, the published leaderboard rankings are taken at face value — we show this is a (potentially costly) mistake. Under existing leaderboards, the relative performance of LLMs is highly sensitive to (often minute) details. We show that for popular multiple-choice question benchmarks (e.g., MMLU), minor perturbations to the benchmark, such as changing the order of choices or the method of answer selection, result in changes in rankings up to 8 positions. We explain this phenomenon by conducting systematic experiments over three broad categories of benchmark perturbations and identifying the sources of this behavior. Our analysis results in several best-practice recommendations, including the advantage of a *hybrid* scoring method for answer selection. Our study highlights the dangers of relying on simple benchmark evaluations and charts the path for more robust evaluation schemes on the existing benchmarks.

REFINESUMM: Self-Refining MLLM for Generating a Multimodal Summarization Dataset	Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at synthesizing key information from diverse sources. However, generating accurate and faithful multimodal summaries is challenging, primarily due to the lack of appropriate multimodal datasets for fine-tuning that meaningfully integrate textual and visual modalities. To address this gap, we present a new dataset designed specifically for image-text multimodal summarization, harnessing the capabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs. We generate summaries from Wikipedia sections and corresponding images and evaluate them across text-based, visual and multimodal dimensions, employing reference-free metrics. To refine the dataset, we: (1) Filter the MLLM-generated summaries by training a critic model on human annotations and using its predictions to remove low-quality summaries; (2) Fine-tune the MLLM with the filtered high-quality summaries; (3) Use the fine-tuned model in turn to regenerate the summaries. This self-refinement process significantly improves summary quality, as measured by human judgements and automatic multimodal metrics, resulting in a valuable dataset for multimodal summarization research. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/amazon-science/refinesumm.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.743	Vaidehi Patil, Leonardo Ribeiro, Mengwen Liu, Mohit Bansal, Markus Dreyer
Navigating the Dual Facets: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Sequential Memory Editing in Large Language Models	Memory Editing (ME) has emerged as an efficient method to modify erroneous facts or inject new facts into Large Language Models (LLMs). Two mainstream ME methods exist: parameter-modifying ME and parameter-preserving ME (integrating extra modules while preserving original parameters). Regrettably, previous studies on ME evaluation have two critical limitations: (i) evaluating LLMs with single edit only, neglecting the need for continuous editing, and (ii) evaluations focusing solely on basic factual triples, overlooking broader LLM capabilities like logical reasoning and reading understanding. This study addresses these limitations with contributions threefold: (i) We explore how ME affects a wide range of fundamental capabilities of LLMs under sequential editing. Experimental results reveal an intriguing phenomenon: Most parameter-modifying ME consistently degrade performance across all tasks after a few sequential edits. In contrast, parameter-preserving ME effectively maintains LLMs' fundamental capabilities but struggles to accurately recall edited knowledge presented in a different format. (ii) We extend our evaluation to different editing settings, such as layers to edit, model size, instruction tuning, etc. Experimental findings indicate several strategies that can potentially mitigate the adverse effects of ME. (iii) We further explain why parameter-modifying damages LLMs from three dimensions: parameter changes after editing, language modeling capability, and the in-context learning capability. Our in-depth study advocates more careful use of ME in real-world scenarios.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.742	Zihao Lin, Mohammad Beigi, Hongxuan Li, Yufan Zhou, Yuxiang Zhang, Qifan Wang, Wenpeng Yin, Lifu Huang
Reducing Privacy Risks in Online Self-Disclosures with Language Models	"Self-disclosure, while being common and rewarding in social media interaction, also poses privacy risks. In this paper, we take the initiative to protect the user-side privacy associated with online self-disclosure through detection and abstraction. We develop a taxonomy of 19 self-disclosure categories and curate a large corpus consisting of 4.8K annotated disclosure spans. We then fine-tune a language model for detection, achieving over 65% partial span F 1 . We further conduct an HCI user study, with 82% of participants viewing the model positively, highlighting its real-world applicability. Motivated by the user feedback, we introduce the task of self-disclosure abstraction, which is rephrasing disclosures into less specific terms while preserving their utility, e.g., ""Im 16F"" to ""I'm a teenage girl"". We explore various fine-tuning strategies, and our best model can generate diverse abstractions that moderately reduce privacy risks while maintaining high utility according to human evaluation. To help users in deciding which disclosures to abstract, we present a task of rating their importance for context understanding. Our fine-tuned model achieves 80% accuracy, on-par with GPT-3.5. Given safety and privacy considerations, we will only release our corpus and models to researcher who agree to the ethical guidelines outlined in Ethics Statement."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.741	Yao Dou, Isadora Krsek, Tarek Naous, Anubha Kabra, Sauvik Das, Alan Ritter, Wei Xu
Meta-Tuning LLMs to Leverage Lexical Knowledge for Generalizable Language Style Understanding	Language style is often used by writers to convey their intentions, identities, and mastery of language. In this paper, we show that current large language models struggle to capture some language styles without fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we investigate whether LLMs can be meta-trained based on representative lexicons to recognize new styles they have not been fine-tuned on. Experiments on 13 established style classification tasks, as well as 63 novel tasks generated using LLMs, demonstrate that meta-training with style lexicons consistently improves zero-shot transfer across styles.

LogicBench: Towards Systematic Evaluation of Logical Reasoning Ability of Large Language Models	"Recently developed large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform remarkably well on a wide range of language understanding tasks. But, can they really ""reason"" over the natural language? This question has been receiving significant research attention and many reasoning skills such as commonsense, numerical, and qualitative have been studied. However, the crucial skill pertaining to 'logical reasoning' has remained underexplored. Existing work investigating this reasoning ability of LLMs has focused only on a couple of inference rules (such as modus ponens and modus tollens) of propositional and first-order logic. Addressing the above limitation, we comprehensively evaluate the logical reasoning ability of LLMs on 25 different reasoning patterns spanning over propositional, first-order, and non-monotonic logics. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce LogicBench, a natural language question-answering dataset focusing on the use of a single inference rule. We conduct detailed analysis with a range of LLMs such as GPT-4, ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama-2, and Mistral using chain-of-thought prompting. Experimental results show that existing LLMs do not fare well on LogicBench; especially, they struggle with instances involving complex reasoning and negations. Furthermore, they sometimes tend to prioritize parametric knowledge over contextual information and overlook the correct reasoning chain. We believe that our work and findings facilitate future research for evaluating and enhancing the logical reasoning ability of LLMs."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.739	Mihir Parmar, Nisarg Patel, Neeraj Varshney, Mutsumi Nakamura, Man Luo, Santosh Mashetty, Arindam Mitra, Chitta Baral
When is Tree Search Useful for LLM Planning? It Depends on the Discriminator	In this paper, we examine how large language models (LLMs) solve multi-step problems under a language agent framework with three components: a generator, a discriminator, and a planning method. We investigate the practical utility of two advanced planning methods, iterative correction and tree search. We present a comprehensive analysis of how discrimination accuracy affects the overall performance of agents when using these two methods or a simpler method, re-ranking. Experiments on two tasks, text-to-SQL parsing and mathematical reasoning, show that: (1) advanced planning methods demand discriminators with at least 90% accuracy to achieve significant improvements over re-ranking; (2) current LLMs' discrimination abilities have not met the needs of advanced planning methods to achieve such improvements; (3) with LLM-based discriminators, advanced planning methods may not adequately balance accuracy and efficiency. For example, compared to the other two methods, tree search is at least 10–20 times slower but leads to negligible performance gains, which hinders its real-world applications.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.738	Ziru Chen, Michael White, Ray Mooney, Ali Payani, Yu Su, Huan Sun
CodeAgent: Enhancing Code Generation with Tool-Integrated Agent Systems for Real-World Repo-level Coding Challenges	Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automated code generation but typically excel only in simpler tasks such as generating standalone code units. However, real-world software development often involves complex code repositories with complex dependencies and extensive documentation. To enable LLMs to handle these realworld repo-level code generation, we present CodeAgent, a novel LLM-based agent framework that employs external tools for effective repo-level code generation. CodeAgent integrates five programming tools, enabling interaction with software artifacts for information retrieval, code implementation, and code testing. We implement four agent strategies to optimize these tools' usage. To the best of our knowledge, CodeAgent is the first agent tool framework specifically for repo-level code generation. In order to measure the effectiveness of our method at the repository level, we have introduced a benchmark dataset CodAgentBench. The performance on this dataset shows a significant improvement brought by our method, with improvements of pass rate ranging from 2.0 to 15.8. Further tests on the HumanEval benchmark confirm CodeAgent's adaptability and efficacy across various code generation tasks. Notably, CodeAgent outperforms commercial products like Github Copilot, showcasing superior accuracy and efficiency. These results demonstrate CodeAgent's robust capabilities in code generation, highlighting its potential for real-world repo-level coding challenges.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.737	Kechi Zhang, Jia Li, Ge Li, Xianjie Shi, Zhi Jin
Never Lost in the Middle: Mastering Long-Context Question Answering with Position-Agnostic Decompositional Training	"While large language models (LLMs) are equipped with longer text input capabilities than before, they are struggling to seek correct information in long contexts. The ""lost in the middle"" problem challenges most LLMs, referring to the dramatic decline in accuracy when correct information is located in the middle. To overcome this crucial issue, this paper proposes to enhance the information searching and reflection ability of LLMs in long contexts via specially designed tasks called Position-Agnostic Multi-step QA (PAM QA). Trained in this task, our model excels in focusing more precisely on the desired information. Experimental results show substantial improvement in Multi-doc QA and other benchmarks, superior to state-of-the-art models by 13.7% absolute gain in shuffled settings, by 21.5% in passage retrieval task. We release our model and code to promote related research in the community."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.736	Junqing He, Kunhao Pan, Xiaoqun Dong, Zhuoyang Song, LiuYiBo LiuYiBo, Qianguosun Qianguosun, Yuxin Liang, Hao Wang, Enming Zhang, Jiaxing Zhang
HiRoPE: Length Extrapolation for Code Models Using Hierarchical Position	Addressing the limitation of context length in large language models for code-related tasks is the primary focus of this paper. Existing LLMs are constrained by their pre-trained context lengths, leading to performance issues in handling long complex code sequences. Inspired by how human programmers navigate code, we introduce Hierarchical Rotary Position Embedding (HiRoPE), a novel approach that enhances the traditional rotary position embedding into a hierarchical format based on the hierarchical structure of source code. HiRoPE offers easy integration into existing LLMs without extra training costs. Our method is extensively evaluated with various LLMs, demonstrating stable performance in tasks such as language modeling and long code completion. We also introduce a new long code understanding task with real-world code projects, in hopes of promoting further development in this code-related field. Theoretically and experimentally, we find that HiRoPE also addresses the out-of-distribution issue in position encoding. Our HiRoPE significantly expands the context length capabilities of LLMs, enabling inference at lengths exponentially greater than the training length.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.735	Kechi Zhang, Ge Li, Huangzhao Zhang, Zhi Jin
Spatially-Aware Speaker for Vision-and-Language Navigation Instruction Generation	Embodied AI aims to develop robots that can understand and execute human language instructions, as well as communicate in natural languages. On this front, we study the task of generating highly detailed navigational instructions for the embodied robots to follow. Although recent studies have demonstrated significant leaps in the generation of step-by-step instructions from sequences of images, the generated instructions lack variety in terms of their referral to objects and landmarks. Existing speaker models learn strategies to evade the evaluation metrics and obtain higher scores even for low-quality sentences. In this work, we propose SAS (Spatially-Aware Speaker), an instruction generator or Speaker model that utilises both structural and semantic knowledge of the environment to produce richer instructions. For training, we employ a reward learning method in an adversarial setting to avoid systematic bias introduced by language evaluation metrics. Empirically, our method outperforms existing instruction generation models, evaluated using standard metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/gmuraleekrishna/SAS.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.734	Muraleekrishna Gopinathan, Martin Masek, Jumana Abu-Khalaf, David Suter
MobileSpeech: A Fast and High-Fidelity Framework for Mobile Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech	Zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has gained significant attention due to its powerful voice cloning capabilities, requiring only a few seconds of unseen speaker voice prompts. However, all previous work has been developed for cloud-based systems. Taking autoregressive models as an example, although these approaches achieve high-fidelity voice cloning, they fall short in terms of inference speed, model size, and robustness. Therefore, we propose MobileSpeech, which is a fast, lightweight, and robust zero-shot text-to-speech system based on mobile devices for the first time. Specifically: 1) leveraging discrete codec, we design a parallel speech mask decoder module called SMD, which incorporates hierarchical information from the speech codec and weight mechanisms across different codec layers during the generation process. Moreover, to bridge the gap between text and speech, we introduce a high-level probabilistic mask that simulates the progression of information flow from less to more during speech generation. 2) For speaker prompts, we extract fine-grained prompt duration from the prompt speech and incorporate text, prompt speech by cross attention in SMD. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MobileSpeech on multilingual datasets at different levels, achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of generating speed and speech quality. MobileSpeech achieves RTF of 0.09 on a single A100 GPU and we have successfully deployed MobileSpeech on mobile devices.

MULFE: A Multi-Level Benchmark for Free Text Model Editing	Adjusting the outdated behaviors of large langugae models (LLMs) after deployment remains a significant challenge. It motivates the model editing research, which is however mainly explored in a restricted task form with triple-based edit requests. Recent works have initiated a transition to a more practical and unified editing task that takes free-form text as edit requests. However, there are gaps in nuanced benchmark designs and re-evaluation of existing methods. To bridge the gaps, we introduce a multi-level benchmark for free text model editing (MULFE). The benchmark categorizes probe queries into three levels of generalization, ranging from basic literal memory to deeper understanding and reasoning. Based on the benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments across various base models, edit sizes, and editing methods, including adaptations of mainstream locate-and-edit and hypernetwork methods. The results highlight the inconsistent behaviors of edited models on different generalization levels. Higher-level generalization remains a significant challenge. Based on the findings, we propose SIDE, a simple yet effective method based on in-context distillation to enhance the generalization performance. The benchmark dataset and evaluation scripts are publicly available at http://github.com/wchrepo/mulfe.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.732	Chenhao Wang, Pengfei Cao, Zhuoran Jin, Yubo Chen, Daojian Zeng, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao
Combining Supervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Label Classification Tasks with Partial Labels	Traditional supervised learning heavily relies on human-annotated datasets, especially in data-hungry neural approaches. However, various tasks, especially multi-label tasks like document-level relation extraction, pose challenges in fully manual annotation due to the specific domain knowledge and large class sets. Therefore, we address the multi-label positive-unlabelled learning (MLPUL) problem, where only a subset of positive classes is annotated. We propose Mixture Learner for Partially Annotated Classification (MLPAC), an RL-based framework combining the exploration ability of reinforcement learning and the exploitation ability of supervised learning. Experimental results across various tasks, including document-level relation extraction, multi-label image classification, and binary PU learning, demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of our framework.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.731	Zixia Jia, Junpeng Li, Shichuan Zhang, Anji Liu, Zilong Zheng
ArchCode: Incorporating Software Requirements in Code Generation with Large Language Models	This paper aims to extend the code generation capability of large language models (LLMs) to automatically manage comprehensive software requirements from given textual descriptions. Such requirements include both functional (i.e. achieving expected behavior for inputs) and non-functional (e.g., time/space performance, robustness, maintainability) requirements. However, textual descriptions can either express requirements verbosely or may even omit some of them. We introduce ARCHCODE, a novel framework that leverages in-context learning to organize requirements observed in descriptions and to extrapolate unexpressed requirements from them. ARCHCODE generates requirements from given descriptions, conditioning them to produce code snippets and test cases. Each test case is tailored to one of the requirements, allowing for the ranking of code snippets based on the compliance of their execution results with the requirements. Public benchmarks show that ARCHCODE enhances to satisfy functional requirements, significantly improving Pass@k scores.Furthermore, we introduce HumanEval-NFR, the first evaluation of LLMs' non-functional requirements in code generation, demonstrating ARCHCODE's superiority over baseline methods. The implementation of ARCHCODE and the HumanEval-NFR benchmark are both publicly accessible.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.730	Hojae Han, Jaejin Kim, Jaeseok Yoo, Youngwon Lee, Seung-won Hwang
Chunk, Align, Select: A Simple Long-sequence Processing Method for Transformers	Although dominant in natural language processing, transformer-based models still struggle with long-sequence processing, due to the computational costs of their self-attention operations, which increase exponentially as the length of the input sequence grows. To address this challenge, we propose a **Sim**ple framework to enhance the long-content processing of off-the-shelf pre-trained transformers via three steps: **C**hunk, **A**lign, and **S**elect (SimCAS). More specifically, we first divide each long-sequence input into a batch of chunks, then align the inter-chunk information during the encoding steps, and finally, select the most representative hidden states from the encoder for the decoding process. With our SimCAS, the computation and memory costs can be reduced to linear complexity. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various real-world long-text summarization and reading comprehension tasks, in which SimCAS significantly outperforms prior long-sequence processing baselines. The code is at [https://github.com/xjw-nlp/SimCAS](https://github.com/xjw-nlp/SimCAS).	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.729	Jiawen Xie, Pengyu Cheng, Xiao Liang, Yong Dai, Nan Du
Using Natural Language Explanations to Improve Robustness of In-context Learning	Recent studies demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can excel in many tasks via in-context learning (ICL). However, recentworks show that ICL-prompted models tend to produce inaccurate results when presented with adversarial inputs. In this work, we investigate whether augmenting ICL with natural language explanations (NLEs) improves the robustness of LLMs on adversarial datasets covering natural language inference and paraphrasing identification. We prompt LLMs with a small set of human-generated NLEs to produce further NLEs, yielding more accurate results than both a zero-shot-ICL setting and using only human-generated NLEs. Our results on five popular LLMs (GPT3.5-turbo, Llama2, Vicuna, Zephyr, and Mistral) show that our approach yields over 6% improvement over baseline approaches for eight adversarial datasets: HANS, ISCS, NaN, ST, PICD, PISP, ANLI, and PAWS. Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that prompt selection strategies significantly enhance ICL on in-distribution test sets. However, our findings reveal that these strategies do not match the efficacy of our approach for robustness evaluations, resulting in an accuracy drop of 8% compared to the proposed approach.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.728	Xuanli He, Yuxiang Wu, Oana-Maria Camburu, Pasquale Minervini, Pontus Stenetorp
Context Consistency between Training and Inference in Simultaneous Machine Translation	Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) aims to yield a real-time partial translation with a monotonically growing source-side context.However, there is a counterintuitive phenomenon about the context usage between training and inference: *e.g.*, in wait- k inference, model consistently trained with wait- k is much worse than that model inconsistently trained with wait- k' ( k'≠ k ) in terms of translation quality. To this end, we first investigate the underlying reasons behind this phenomenon and uncover the following two factors: 1) the limited correlation between translation quality and training loss; 2) exposure bias between training and inference. Based on both reasons, we then propose an effective training approach called context consistency training accordingly, which encourages consistent context usage between training and inference by optimizing translation quality and latency as bi-objectives and exposing the predictions to the model during the training. The experiments on three language pairs demonstrate that our SiMT system encouraging context consistency outperforms existing SiMT systems with context inconsistency for the first time.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.727	Meizhi Zhong, Lemao Liu, Kehai Chen, Mingming Yang, Min Zhang
Advancing Parameter Efficiency in Fine-tuning via Representation Editing	Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has gained significant attention for its ability to achieve competitive results while updating only a small subset of trainable parameters. Despite the promising performance of current PEFT methods, they present challenges in hyperparameter selection, such as determining the rank of LoRA or Adapter, or specifying the length of soft prompts. In addressing these challenges, we propose a novel approach to fine-tuning neural models, termed Representation EDiting (RED), which scales and biases the representation produced at each layer. RED substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 25,700 compared to full parameter fine-tuning, and by a factor of 32 compared to LoRA. Remarkably, RED achieves comparable or superior results to full parameter fine-tuning and other PEFT methods. Extensive experiments were conducted across models of varying architectures and scales, including RoBERTa, GPT-2, T5, and Llama-2, and the results demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of RED, positioning it as a promising PEFT approach for large neural models.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.726	Muling Wu, Wenhao Liu, Xiaohua Wang, Tianlong Li, Changze Lv, Zixuan Ling, Zhu JianHao, Cenyuan Zhang, Xiaoqing Zheng, Xuanjing Huang
WARDEN: Multi-Directional Backdoor Watermarks for Embedding-as-a-Service Copyright Protection	Embedding as a Service (EaaS) has become a widely adopted solution, which offers feature extraction capabilities for addressing various downstream tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Prior studies have shown that EaaS can be prone to model extraction attacks; nevertheless, this concern could be mitigated by adding backdoor watermarks to the text embeddings and subsequently verifying the attack models post-publication. Through the analysis of the recent watermarking strategy for EaaS, EmbMarker, we design a novel CSE (Clustering, Selection, Elimination) attack that removes the backdoor watermark while maintaining the high utility of embeddings, indicating that the previous watermarking approach can be breached. In response to this new threat, we propose a new protocol to make the removal of watermarks more challenging by incorporating multiple possible watermark directions. Our defense approach, WARDEN, notably increases the stealthiness of watermarks and has been empirically shown to be effective against CSE attack.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.725	Anudeex Shetty, Yue Teng, Ke He, Qiongkai Xu
PathReasoner: Modeling Reasoning Path with Equivalent Extension for Logical Question Answering	Logical reasoning task has attracted great interest since it was proposed. Faced with such a task, current competitive models, even large language models (e.g., ChatGPT and PaLM 2), still perform badly. Previous promising LMs struggle in logical consistency modeling and logical structure perception. To this end, we model the logical reasoning task by transforming each logical sample into reasoning paths and propose an architecture PathReasoner. It addresses the task from the views of both data and model. To expand the diversity of the logical samples, we propose an atom extension strategy supported by equivalent logical formulas, to form new reasoning paths. From the model perspective, we design a stack of transformer-style blocks. In particular, we propose a path-attention module to joint model in-atom and cross-atom relations with the high-order diffusion strategy. Experiments show that PathReasoner achieves competitive performances on two logical reasoning benchmarks and great generalization abilities.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.724	Fangzhi Xu, Qika Lin, Tianzhe Zhao, JiaweiHan JiaweiHan, Jun Liu
ESCoT: Towards Interpretable Emotional Support Dialogue Systems	Understanding the reason for emotional support response is crucial for establishing connections between users and emotional support dialogue systems. Previous works mostly focus on generating better responses but ignore interpretability, which is extremely important for constructing reliable dialogue systems. To empower the system with better interpretability, we propose an emotional support response generation scheme, named E motion-Focused and S trategy-Driven C hain- o f- T hought ( ESCoT ), mimicking the process of identifying , understanding , and regulating emotions. Specially, we construct a new dataset with ESCoT in two steps: (1) Dialogue Generation where we first generate diverse conversation situations, then enhance dialogue generation using richer emotional support strategies based on these situations; (2) Chain Supplement where we focus on supplementing selected dialogues with elements such as emotion, stimuli, appraisal, and strategy reason, forming the manually verified chains. Additionally, we further develop a model to generate dialogue responses with better interpretability. We also conduct extensive experiments and human evaluations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed ESCoT and generated dialogue responses. Our dataset, code, and model will be released.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.723	Tenggan Zhang, Xinjie Zhang, Jinming Zhao, Li Zhou, Qin Jin
Maverick: Efficient and Accurate Coreference Resolution Defying Recent Trends	Large autoregressive generative models have emerged as the cornerstone for achieving the highest performance across several Natural Language Processing tasks. However, the urge to attain superior results has, at times, led to the premature replacement of carefully designed task-specific approaches without exhaustive experimentation. The Coreference Resolution task is no exception; all recent state-of-the-art solutions adopt large generative autoregressive models that outperform encoder-based discriminative systems. In this work, we challenge this recent trend by introducing Maverick, a carefully designed – yet simple – pipeline, which enables running a state-of-the-art Coreference Resolution system within the constraints of an academic budget, outperforming models with up to 13 billion parameters with as few as 500 million parameters. Maverick achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CoNLL-2012 benchmark, training with up to 0.006x the memory resources and obtaining a 170x faster inference compared to previous state-of-the-art systems. We extensively validate the robustness of the Maverick framework with an array of diverse experiments, reporting improvements over prior systems in data-scarce, long-document, and out-of-domain settings. We release our code and models for research purposes at https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/maverick-coref.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.722	Giuliano Martinelli, Edoardo Barba, Roberto Navigli
S2GSL: Incorporating Segment to Syntactic Enhanced Graph Structure Learning for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis	Previous graph-based approaches in Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis(ABSA) have demonstrated impressive performance by utilizing graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to learn structures of static dependency trees and dynamic latent trees. However, incorporating both semantic and syntactic information simultaneously within complex global structures can introduce irrelevant contexts and syntactic dependencies during the process of graph structure learning, potentially resulting in inaccurate predictions. In order to address the issues above, we propose S 2 GSL, incorporating Segment to Syntactic enhanced Graph Structure Learning for ABSA. Specifically, S 2 GSL is featured with a segment-aware semantic graph learning and a syntax-based latent graph learning enabling the removal of irrelevant contexts and dependencies, respectively. We further propose a self-adaptive aggregation network that facilitates the fusion of two graph learning branches, thereby achieving complementarity across diverse structures. Experimental results on four benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.721	Bingfeng Chen, Qihan Ouyang, Yongqi Luo, Boyan Xu, Ruichu Cai, Zhifeng Hao
Faithful Logical Reasoning via Symbolic Chain-of-Thought	While the recent Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique enhances the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) with the theory of mind, it might still struggle in handling logical reasoning that relies much on symbolic expressions and rigid deducing rules. To strengthen the logical reasoning capability of LLMs, we propose a novel Symbolic Chain-of-Thought, namely SymbCoT, a fully LLM-based framework that integrates symbolic expressions and logic rules with CoT prompting. Technically, building upon an LLM, SymbCoT 1) first translates the natural language context into the symbolic format, and then 2) derives a step-by-step plan to solve the problem with symbolic logical rules, 3) followed by a verifier to check the translation and reasoning chain. Via thorough evaluations on 5 standard datasets with both First-Order Logic and Constraint Optimization symbolic expressions, SymbCoT shows striking improvements over the CoT method consistently, meanwhile refreshing the current state-of-the-art performances. We further demonstrate that our system advances in more faithful, flexible, and explainable logical reasoning. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at combining symbolic expressions and rules into CoT for logical reasoning with LLMs. Code is open at https://github.com/Aiden0526/SymbCoT.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.720	Jundong Xu, Hao Fei, Liangming Pan, Qian Liu, Mong-Li Lee, Wynne Hsu
Bridging Word-Pair and Token-Level Metaphor Detection with Explainable Domain Mining	Metaphor detection aims to identify whether a linguistic expression in text is metaphorical or literal. Most existing research tackles this problem either using word-pair or token-level information as input, and thus treats word-pair and token-level metaphor detection as distinct subtasks. Benefited from the simplified structure of word pairs, recent methods for word-pair metaphor detection can provide intermediate explainable clues for the detection results, which remains a challenging issue for token-level metaphor detection. To mitigate this issue in token-level metaphor detection and take advantage of word pairs, in this paper, we make the first attempt to bridge word-pair and token-level metaphor detection via modeling word pairs within a sentence as explainable intermediate information. As the central role of verb in metaphorical expressions, we focus on token-level verb metaphor detection and propose a novel explainable Word Pair based Domain Mining (WPDM) method. Our work is inspired by conceptual metaphor theory (CMT). We first devise an approach for conceptual domain mining utilizing semantic role mapping and resources at cognitive, commonsense and lexical levels. We then leverage the inconsistency between source and target domains for core word pair modeling to facilitate the explainability. Experiments on four datasets verify the effectiveness of our method and demonstrate its capability to provide the core word pair and corresponding conceptual domains as explainable clues for metaphor detection.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.719	Yuan Tian, Ruike Zhang, Nan Xu, Wenji Mao
Toward In-Context Teaching: Adapting Examples to Students’ Misconceptions	When a teacher provides examples for a student to study, these examples must be informative, enabling a student to progress from their current state toward a target concept or skill. Good teachers must therefore simultaneously infer what students already know and adapt their teaching to students' changing state of knowledge. There is increasing interest in using computational models, particularly large language models, as pedagogical tools. As students, language models in particular have shown a remarkable ability to adapt to new tasks given small numbers of examples. But how effectively can these models adapt as teachers to students of different types? To study this question, we introduce a suite of models and evaluation methods we call AdapT. AdapT has two components: (1) a collection of simulated Bayesian student models that can be used for evaluation of automated teaching methods; (2) a platform for evaluation with human students, to characterize the real-world effectiveness of these methods. We additionally introduce (3) AToM, a new probabilistic method for adaptive teaching that jointly infers students' past beliefs and optimizes for the correctness of future beliefs. In evaluations of simulated students across three learning domains (fraction arithmetic, English morphology, function learning), AToM systematically outperforms LLM-based and standard Bayesian teaching methods. In human experiments, both AToM and LLMs outperform non-adaptive random example selection. Our results highlight both the difficulty of the adaptive teaching task and the potential of learned adaptive methods for solving it.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.718	Alexis Ross, Jacob Andreas
HOLMES: Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graphs for Multi-hop Question Answering using LLMs	Given unstructured text, Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at answering simple (single-hop) questions. However, as the complexity of the questions increase, the performance of LLMs degrade. We believe this is due to the overhead associated with understanding the complex question followed by filtering and aggregating unstructured information in the raw text. Recent methods try to reduce this burden by integrating structured knowledge triples into the raw text, aiming to provide a structured overview that simplifies information processing. However, this simplistic approach is query-agnostic and the extracted facts are ambiguous as they lack context. To address these drawbacks and to enable LLMs to answer complex (multi-hop) questions with ease, we propose to use a knowledge graph (KG) that is context-aware and is distilled to contain query-relevant information. The use of our compressed distilled KG as input to the LLM results in our method utilizing up to 67% fewer tokens to represent the query relevant information present in the supporting documents, compared to the state-of-the-art (SoTA) method.Our experiments show consistent improvements over the SoTA across several metrics (EM, F1, BERTScore, and Human Eval) on two popular benchmark datasets (HotpotQA and MuSiQue).	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.717	Pranoy Panda, Ankush Agarwal, Chaitanya Devaguptapu, Manohar Kaul, Prathosh Ap
Visualization Recommendation with Prompt-based Reprogramming of Large Language Models	Visualization recommendations, which aim to automatically match proper visual charts for specific data tables, can significantly simplify the data analysis process. Traditional approaches in this domain have primarily relied on rule-based or machine learning-based methodologies. These methods often demand extensive manual maintenance and yet fail to fully comprehend the tabular data, leading to unsatisfactory performance. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools, exhibiting strong reasoning capabilities. This advancement suggests their substantial promise in addressing visualization recommendation challenges. However, effectively harnessing LLMs to discern and rationalize patterns in tabular data, and consequently deduce the essential information for chart generation, remains an unresolved challenge. To this end, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Table Prompt-based reprogramming framework, named HTP. This framework aims to integrate multi-dimensional tabular data into LLMs through a strategically crafted prompt learning method while keeping the LLMs' backbone and weights unaltered. The HTP framework uniquely incorporates a four-level prompt structure, encompassing general, instance, cluster, and column levels. This multi-level approach is engineered to provide a comprehensive understanding of both general distribution and multifaceted fine-grained features of tabular data, before inputting the tabular data into the frozen LLM. Our empirical studies confirm that the HTP framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, marking an advancement in the field of data visualization and analysis. The code and data will be made publicly available upon acceptance.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.716	Xinhang Li, Jingbo Zhou, Wei Chen, Derong Xu, Tong Xu, Enhong Chen
Word Matters: What Influences Domain Adaptation in Summarization?	Domain adaptation aims to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to generalize domain datasets unseen effectively during the training phase. However, factors such as the size of the model parameters and the scale of training data are general influencers and do not reflect the nuances of domain adaptation performance. This paper investigates the fine-grained factors affecting domain adaptation performance, analyzing the specific impact of 'words' in training data on summarization tasks. We propose quantifying dataset learning difficulty as the learning difficulty of generative summarization, which is determined by two indicators: word-based compression rate and abstraction level. Our experiments conclude that, when considering dataset learning difficulty, the cross-domain overlap and the performance gain in summarization tasks exhibit an approximate linear relationship, which is not directly related to the number of words. Based on this finding, predicting a model's performance on unknown domain datasets is possible without undergoing training.

Context versus Prior Knowledge in Language Models	To answer a question, language models often need to integrate prior knowledge learned during pretraining and new information presented in context. We hypothesize that models perform this integration in a predictable way across different questions and contexts: models will rely more on prior knowledge for questions about entities (e.g., persons, places, etc.) that they are more familiar with due to higher exposure in the training corpus, and be more easily persuaded by some contexts than others. To formalize this problem, we propose two mutual information-based metrics to measure a model's dependency on a context and on its prior about an entity: first, the persuasion score of a given context represents how much a model depends on the context in its decision, and second, the susceptibility score of a given entity represents how much the model can be swayed away from its original answer distribution about an entity. We empirically test our metrics for their validity and reliability. Finally, we explore and find a relationship between the scores and the model's expected familiarity with an entity, and provide two use cases to illustrate their benefits.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.714	Kevin Du, Vésteinn Snæbjarnarson, Niklas Stoehr, Jennifer White, Aaron Schein, Ryan Cotterell
Bridging the Empirical-Theoretical Gap in Neural Network Formal Language Learning Using Minimum Description Length	Neural networks offer good approximation to many tasks but consistently fail to reach perfect generalization, even when theoretical work shows that such perfect solutions can be expressed by certain architectures. Using the task of formal language learning, we focus on one simple formal language and show that the theoretically correct solution is in fact not an optimum of commonly used objectives — even with regularization techniques that according to common wisdom should lead to simple weights and good generalization (L1, L2) or other meta-heuristics (early-stopping, dropout). On the other hand, replacing standard targets with the Minimum Description Length objective (MDL) results in the correct solution being an optimum.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.713	Nur Lan, Emmanuel Chemla, Roni Katzir
Document-Level Machine Translation with Large-Scale Public Parallel Corpora	Despite the fact that document-level machine translation has inherent advantages over sentence-level machine translation due to additional information available to a model from document context, most translation systems continue to operate at a sentence level. This is primarily due to the severe lack of publicly available large-scale parallel corpora at the document level. We release a large-scale open parallel corpus with document context extracted from ParaCrawl in five language pairs, along with code to compile document-level datasets for any language pair supported by ParaCrawl. We train context-aware models on these datasets and find improvements in terms of overall translation quality and targeted document-level phenomena. We also analyse how much long-range information is useful to model some of these discourse phenomena and find models are able to utilise context from several preceding sentences.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.712	Proyag Pal, Alexandra Birch, Kenneth Heafield
Beyond Orthography: Automatic Recovery of Short Vowels and Dialectal Sounds in Arabic	This paper presents a novel Dialectal Sound and Vowelization Recovery framework, designed to recognize borrowed and dialectal sounds within phonologically diverse and dialect-rich languages, that extends beyond its standard orthographic sound sets. The proposed framework utilized quantized sequence of input with(out) continuous pretrained self-supervised representation. We show the efficacy of the pipeline using limited data for Arabic, a dialect-rich language containing more than 22 major dialects. Phonetically correct transcribed speech resources for dialectal Arabic is scare. Therefore, we introduce ArabVoice15, a first of its kind, curated test set featuring 5 hours of dialectal speech across 15 Arab countries, with phonetically accurate transcriptions, including borrowed and dialect-specific sounds. We described in detail the annotation guideline along with the analysis of the dialectal confusion pairs. Our extensive evaluation includes both subjective – human perception tests and objective measures. Our empirical results, reported with three test sets, show that with only one and half hours of training data, our model improve character error rate by ≈7% in ArabVoice15 compared to the baseline.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.711	Yassine El Kheir, Hamdy Mubarak, Ahmed Ali, Shammur Chowdhury
Effects of diversity incentives on sample diversity and downstream model performance in LLM-based text augmentation	The latest generative large language models (LLMs) have found their application in data augmentation tasks, where small numbers of text samples are LLM-paraphrased and then used to fine-tune downstream models. However, more research is needed to assess how different prompts, seed data selection strategies, filtering methods, or model settings affect the quality of paraphrased data (and downstream models). In this study, we investigate three text diversity incentive methods well established in crowdsourcing: taboo words, hints by previous outlier solutions, and chaining on previous outlier solutions. Using these incentive methods as part of instructions to LLMs augmenting text datasets, we measure their effects on generated texts' lexical diversity and downstream model performance. We compare the effects over 5 different LLMs, 6 datasets and 2 downstream models. We show that diversity is most increased by taboo words, but downstream model performance is highest with hints.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.710	Jan Cegin, Branislav Pecher, Jakub Simko, Ivan Srba, Maria Bielikova, Peter Brusilovsky
When Phrases Meet Probabilities: Enabling Open Relation Extraction with Cooperating Large Language Models	Current clustering-based open relation extraction (OpenRE) methods usually apply clustering algorithms on top of pre-trained language models. However, this practice has three drawbacks. First, embeddings from language models are high-dimensional and anisotropic, so using simple metrics to calculate distances between these embeddings may not accurately reflect the relational similarity. Second, there exists a gap between the pre-trained language models and downstream clustering for their different objective forms. Third, clustering with embeddings deviates from the primary aim of relation extraction, as it does not directly obtain relations. In this work, we propose a new idea for OpenRE in the era of LLMs, that is, extracting relational phrases and directly exploiting the knowledge in LLMs to assess the semantic similarity between phrases without relying on any additional metrics. Based on this idea, we developed a framework, oreLLM, that makes two LLMs work collaboratively to achieve clustering and address the above issues. Experimental results on different datasets show that oreLLM outperforms current baselines by 1.4%∼ 3.13% in terms of clustering accuracy.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.709	Jiaxin Wang, Lingling Zhang, Wee Sun Lee, Yujie Zhong, Liwei Kang, Jun Liu
From Sights to Insights: Towards Summarization of Multimodal Clinical Documents	The advancement of Artificial Intelligence is pivotal in reshaping healthcare, enhancing diagnostic precision, and facilitating personalized treatment strategies. One major challenge for healthcare professionals is quickly navigating through long clinical documents to provide timely and effective solutions. Doctors often struggle to draw quick conclusions from these extensive documents. To address this issue and save time for healthcare professionals, an effective summarization model is essential. Most current models assume the data is only text-based. However, patients often include images of their medical conditions in clinical documents. To effectively summarize these multimodal documents, we introduce EDI-Summ, an innovative Image-Guided Encoder-Decoder Model. This model uses modality-aware contextual attention on the encoder and an image cross-attention mechanism on the decoder, enhancing the BART base model to create detailed visual-guided summaries. We have tested our model extensively on three multimodal clinical benchmarks involving multimodal question and dialogue summarization tasks. Our analysis demonstrates that EDI-Summ outperforms state-of-the-art large language and vision-aware models in these summarization tasks. Disclaimer: The work includes vivid medical illustrations, depicting the essential aspects of the subject matter.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.708	Akash Ghosh, Mohit Tomar, Abhisek Tiwari, Sriparna Saha, Jatin Salve, Setu Sinha
Symbol-LLM: Towards Foundational Symbol-centric Interface For Large Language Models	Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable ability in processing and generating human-like text, they do have limitations when it comes to comprehending and expressing world knowledge that extends beyond the boundaries of natural language(e.g., chemical molecular formula). Injecting a collection of symbolic data directly into the training of LLMs can be problematic, as it disregards the synergies among different symbolic families and overlooks the need for a balanced mixture of natural and symbolic data. In this work, we tackle these challenges from both a data and framework perspective and introduce Symbol-LLM series models. First, we curated a data collection consisting of 34 tasks and incorporating 20 distinct symbolic families, intending to capture the interrelations and foster synergies between symbols. Then, a two-stage tuning framework succeeds in injecting symbolic knowledge without loss of the generality ability. Extensive experiments on both symbol- and NL-centric tasks demonstrate the balanced and superior performances of Symbol-LLM series models.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.707	Fangzhi Xu, Zhiyong Wu, Qiushi Sun, Siyu Ren, Fei Yuan, Shuai Yuan, Qika Lin, Yu Qiao, Jun Liu
Small But Funny: A Feedback-Driven Approach to Humor Distillation	"The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought to light promising language generation capabilities, particularly in performing tasks like complex reasoning and creative writing. Consequently, distillation through imitation of teacher responses has emerged as a popular technique to transfer knowledge from LLMs to more accessible, Small Language Models (SLMs). While this works well for simpler tasks, there is a substantial performance gap on tasks requiring intricate language comprehension and creativity, such as humor generation. We hypothesize that this gap may stem from the fact that creative tasks might be hard to learn by imitation alone and explore whether an approach, involving supplementary guidance from the teacher, could yield higher performance. To address this, we study the effect of assigning a dual role to the LLM - as a ""teacher"" generating data, as well as a ""critic"" evaluating the student's performance. Our experiments on humor generation reveal that the incorporation of feedback significantly narrows the performance gap between SLMs and their larger counterparts compared to merely relying on imitation. As a result, our research highlights the potential of using feedback as an additional dimension to data when transferring complex language abilities via distillation."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.706	Sahithya Ravi, Patrick Huber, Akshat Shrivastava, Vered Shwartz, Arash Einolghozati
LLMArena: Assessing Capabilities of Large Language Models in Dynamic Multi-Agent Environments	Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revealed their potential for achieving autonomous agents possessing human-level intelligence. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLM Agents either use static datasets, potentially leading to data leakage or focus only on single-agent scenarios, overlooking the complexities of multi-agent interactions. There is a lack of a benchmark that evaluates the diverse capabilities of LLM agents in multi-agent, dynamic environments. To this end, we introduce LLMArena, a novel and easily extensible framework for evaluating the diverse capabilities of LLM in multi-agent dynamic environments. LLMArena encompasses seven distinct gaming environments, employing Trueskill scoring to assess crucial abilities in LLM agents, including spatial reasoning, strategic planning, numerical reasoning, risk assessment, communication, opponent modeling, and team collaboration. We conduct an extensive experiment and human evaluation among different sizes and types of LLMs, showing that LLMs still have a significant journey ahead in their development towards becoming fully autonomous agents, especially in opponent modeling and team collaboration. We hope LLMArena could guide future research towards enhancing these capabilities in LLMs, ultimately leading to more sophisticated and practical applications in dynamic, multi-agent settings.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.705	Junzhe Chen, Xuming Hu, Shuodi Liu, Shiyu Huang, Wei-Wei Tu, Zhaofeng He, Lijie Wen
CritiqueLLM: Towards an Informative Critique Generation Model for Evaluation of Large Language Model Generation	Since the natural language processing (NLP) community started to make large language models (LLMs) act as a critic to evaluate the quality of generated texts, most of the existing works train a critique generation model on the evaluation data labeled by GPT-4's direct prompting. We observe that these models lack the ability to generate informative critiques in both pointwise grading and pairwise comparison especially without references. As a result, their generated critiques cannot provide fine-grained distinguishability on generated texts, causing unsatisfactory evaluation performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method called Eval-Instruct, which can first acquire pointwise grading critiques with pseudo references and then revise these critiques via multi-path prompting to obtain informative evaluation data in different tasks and settings, including pointwise grading and pairwise comparison with / without references. After fine-tuning on these data, the resulting model CritiqueLLM is empirically shown to outperform ChatGPT and all the open-source baselines and even achieve comparable evaluation performance to GPT-4 in system-level correlations of pointwise grading. We also demonstrate that our generated critiques can act as scalable feedback to further improve the generation quality of strong LLMs like ChatGPT.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.704	Pei Ke, Bosi Wen, Andrew Feng, Xiao Liu, Xuanyu Lei, Jiale Cheng, Shengyuan Wang, Aohan Zeng, Yuxiao Dong, Hongning Wang, Jie Tang, Minlie Huang
Living in the Moment: Can Large Language Models Grasp Co-Temporal Reasoning?	Temporal reasoning is fundamental for large language models (LLMs) to comprehend the world. Current temporal reasoning datasets are limited to questions about single or isolated events, falling short in mirroring the realistic temporal characteristics involving concurrent nature and intricate temporal interconnections. In this paper, we introduce CoTempQA, a comprehensive co-temporal Question Answering (QA) benchmark containing four co-temporal scenarios (Equal, Overlap, During, Mix) with 4,748 samples for evaluating the co-temporal comprehension and reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our extensive experiments reveal a significant gap between the performance of current LLMs and human-level reasoning on CoTempQA tasks. Even when enhanced with Chain of Thought (CoT) methodologies, models consistently struggle with our task. In our preliminary exploration, we discovered that mathematical reasoning plays a significant role in handling co-temporal events and proposed a strategy to boost LLMs' co-temporal reasoning from a mathematical perspective. We hope that our CoTempQA datasets will encourage further advancements in improving the co-temporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.703	Zhaochen Su, Juntao Li, Jun Zhang, Tong Zhu, Xiaoye Qu, Pan Zhou, Yan Bowen, Yu Cheng, Min Zhang
DRAGIN: Dynamic Retrieval Augmented Generation based on the Real-time Information Needs of Large Language Models	Dynamic retrieval augmented generation (RAG) paradigm actively decides when and what to retrieve during the text generation process of Large Language Models (LLMs).There are two key elements of this paradigm: identifying the optimal moment to activate the retrieval module (deciding when to retrieve) and crafting the appropriate query once retrieval is triggered (determining what to retrieve).However, current dynamic RAG methods fall short in both aspects. Firstly, the strategies for deciding when to retrieve often rely on static rules. Moreover, the strategies for deciding what to retrieve typically limit themselves to the LLM's most recent sentence or the last few tokens, while the LLM's information needs may span across the entire context.To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new framework, DRAGIN, i.e., Dynamic Retrieval Augmented Generation based on the Information Needs of LLMs. Our framework is specifically designed to make decisions on when and what to retrieve based on the LLM's information needs during the text generation process.We evaluate DRAGIN along with existing methods comprehensively over 4 knowledge-intensive generation datasets. Experimental results show that DRAGIN achieves superior performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.702	Weihang Su, Yichen Tang, Qingyao Ai, Zhijing Wu, Yiqun Liu
Learning to Decode Collaboratively with Multiple Language Models	"We propose a method to teach multiple large language models (LLM) to collaborate by interleaving their generations at the token level. We model the decision of which LLM generates the next token as a latent variable. By optimizing the marginal likelihood of a training set under our latent variable model, the base LLM automatically learns when to generate itself and when to call on one of the ""assistant"" language models to generate, all without direct supervision. Token-level collaboration during decoding allows for a fusion of each model's expertise in a manner tailored to the specific task at hand. Our collaborative decoding is especially useful in cross-domain settings where a generalist base LLM learns to invoke domain expert models. On instruction-following, domain-specific QA, and reasoning tasks, we show that the performance of the joint system exceeds that of the individual models. Through qualitative analysis, we show models trained with our method exhibit several interesting collaboration patterns, e.g., template-filling, by visualizing the learned latent decisions."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.701	Zejiang Shen, Hunter Lang, Bailin Wang, Yoon Kim, David Sontag
Generalizability of Mixture of Domain-Specific Adapters from the Lens of Signed Weight Directions and its Application to Effective Model Pruning	Several parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods based on adapters have been proposed as a streamlined approach to incorporate not only a single specialized knowledge into existing Pre-Trained Language Models (PLMs) but also multiple of them at once. Recent works such as AdapterSoup propose to mix not all but only a selective sub-set of domain-specific adapters during inference via model weight averaging to optimize performance on novel, unseen domains with excellent computational efficiency. However, the essential generalizability of this emerging weight-space adapter mixing mechanism on unseen, in-domain examples remains unexplored. Thus, in this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis to elucidate the generalizability of domain-specific adapter mixtures in in-domain evaluation. We also provide investigations into the inner workings of the mixture of domain-specific adapters by analyzing their weight signs, yielding critical analysis on the negative correlation between their fraction of weight sign difference and their mixtures' generalizability. The code is available at Github.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.700	Tuc Nguyen, Thai Le
SOTOPIA-π: Interactive Learning of Socially Intelligent Language Agents	Humans learn social skills through both imitation and social interaction. This social learning process is largely understudied by existing research on building language agents. Motivated by this gap, we propose an interactive learning method, SOTOPIA-π, that improves the social intelligence of language agents. This method leverages behavior cloning and self-reinforcement based training on filtered social interaction data according to large language model (LLM) rating. We show that our training method allows a 7B LLM to reach the social goal completion ability of an expert model (GPT-4-based agent) without the loss of more generic abilities, such as the ability to answer knowledge-based questions. We also demonstrate that this training paradigm uncovers some weaknesses in standard evaluation and safety training paradigms that (1) LLM-based evaluation of social intelligence overestimates the abilities of the language agents trained specifically for social interaction, and that (2) despite not training for better safety or question answering (QA) ability, our methods improve the safety of language agents and maintain general QA ability on the MMLU benchmark.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.698	Ruiyi Wang, Haofei Yu, Wenxin Zhang, Zhengyang Qi, Maarten Sap, Yonatan Bisk, Graham Neubig, Hao Zhu
XLAVS-R: Cross-Lingual Audio-Visual Speech Representation Learning for Noise-Robust Speech Perception	Speech recognition and translation systems perform poorly on noisy inputs, which are frequent in realistic environments. Augmenting these systems with visual signals has the potential to improve robustness to noise. However, audio-visual (AV) data is only available in limited amounts and for fewer languages than audio-only resources.To address this gap, we present XLAVS-R, a cross-lingual audio-visual speech representation model for noise-robust speech recognition and translation in over 100 languages. It is designed to maximize the benefits of limited multilingual AV pre-training data, by building on top of audio-only multilingual pre-training and simplifying existing pre-training schemes. Extensive evaluation on the MuAViC benchmark shows the strength of XLAVS-R on downstream audio-visual speech recognition and translation tasks, where it outperforms the previous state of the art by up to 18.5% WER and 4.7 BLEU given noisy AV inputs, and enables strong zero-shot audio-visual ability with audio-only fine-tuning.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.697	HyoJung Han, Mohamed Anwar, Juan Pino, Wei-Ning Hsu, Marine Carpuat, Bowen Shi, Changhan Wang
Harder Task Needs More Experts: Dynamic Routing in MoE Models	In this paper, we introduce a novel dynamic expert selection framework for Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, aiming to enhance computational efficiency and model performance by adjusting the number of activated experts based on input difficulty. Unlike existing MoE approaches that rely on fixed TopK Routing, which activates a predetermined number of experts regardless of the input's complexity, our method dynamically allocates experts based on the confidence level in expert selection for each input. This allows for more efficient utilization of computational resources, activating more experts for complex tasks requiring advanced reasoning and fewer for simpler tasks. Through extensive evaluations, our dynamic routing method demonstrates substantial improvements over Top2 Routing across various benchmarks, achieving an average improvement of 0.7% with less than 90% activated parameters. Further analysis shows our model dispatches more experts to tasks requiring complex reasoning skills, like BBH, confirming its ability to dynamically allocate computational resources in alignment with the input's complexity.Our findings also highlight a variation in the number of experts needed across different layers of the transformer model, offering insights into the potential for designing heterogeneous MoE frameworks.

LoRA-Flow: Dynamic LoRA Fusion for Large Language Models in Generative Tasks	LoRA employs lightweight modules to customize large language models (LLMs) for each downstream task or domain, where different learned additional modules represent diverse skills. Combining existing LoRAs to address new tasks can enhance the reusability of learned LoRAs, particularly beneficial for tasks with limited annotated data. Most prior works on LoRA combination primarily rely on task-level weights for each involved LoRA, making different examples and tokens share the same LoRA weights. However, in generative tasks, different tokens may necessitate diverse skills to manage. Taking the Chinese math task as an example, understanding the problem description may depend more on the Chinese LoRA, while the calculation part may rely more on the math LoRA. To this end, we propose LoRA-Flow, which utilizes dynamic weights to adjust the impact of different LoRAs. The weights at each step are determined by a fusion gate with extremely few parameters, which can be learned with only 200 training examples. Experiments across six generative tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines with task-level fusion weights. This underscores the necessity of introducing dynamic fusion weights for LoRA combination.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.695	Hanqing Wang, Bowen Ping, Shuo Wang, Xu Han, Yun Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun
API-BLEND: A Comprehensive Corpora for Training and Benchmarking API LLMs	There is a growing need for Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively use tools and external Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to plan and complete tasks. As such, there is tremendous interest in methods that can acquire sufficient quantities of train and test data that involve calls to tools / APIs. Two lines of research have emerged as the predominant strategies for addressing this challenge. The first has focused on synthetic data generation techniques, while the second has involved curating task-adjacent datasets which can be transformed into API / Tool-based tasks. In this paper, we focus on the task of identifying, curating, and transforming existing datasets and, in turn, introduce API-BLEND, a large corpora for training and systematic testing of tool-augmented LLMs. The datasets mimic real-world scenarios involving API-tasks such as API / tool detection, slot filling, and sequencing of the detected APIs. We demonstrate the utility of the API-BLEND dataset for both training and benchmarking purposes.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.694	Kinjal Basu, Ibrahim Abdelaziz, Subhajit Chaudhury, Soham Dan, Maxwell Crouse, Asim Munawar, Vernon Austel, Sadhana Kumaravel, Vinod Muthusamy, Pavan Kapanipathi, Luis Lastras
KnowledgeFMath: A Knowledge-Intensive Math Reasoning Dataset in Finance Domains	We introduce KnowledgeFMath, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in solving knowledge-intensive math reasoning problems. Compared to prior works, this study features three core advancements. First, KnowledgeFMath includes 1,259 problems with a hybrid of textual and tabular content. These problems require college-level knowledge in the finance domain for effective resolution. Second, we provide expert-annotated, detailed solution references in Python program format, ensuring a high-quality benchmark for LLM assessment. We also construct a finance-domain knowledge bank and investigate various knowledge integration strategies. Finally, we evaluate a wide spectrum of 26 LLMs with different prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought and Program-of-Thought. Our experimental results reveal that the current best-performing system (i.e., GPT-4 with CoT prompting) achieves only 56.6% accuracy, leaving substantial room for improvement. Moreover, while augmenting LLMs with external knowledge can improve their performance (e.g., from 33.5% to 47.1% for GPT-3.5), their accuracy remains significantly lower than the estimated human expert performance of 92%. We believe that KnowledgeFMath can advance future research in the area of domain-specific knowledge retrieval and integration, particularly within the context of solving math reasoning problems.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.693	Yilun Zhao, Hongjun Liu, Yitao Long, Rui Zhang, Chen Zhao, Arman Cohan
TaPERA: Enhancing Faithfulness and Interpretability in Long-Form Table QA by Content Planning and Execution-based Reasoning	Long-form Table Question Answering (LFTQA) requires systems to generate paragraph long and complex answers to questions over tabular data. While Large language models based systems have made significant progress, it often hallucinates, especially when the task involves complex reasoning over tables. To tackle this issue, we propose a new LLM-based framework, TaPERA, for LFTQA tasks. Our framework uses a modular approach that decomposes the whole process into three sub-modules: 1) QA-based Content Planner that iteratively decomposes the input question into sub-questions; 2) Execution-based Table Reasoner that produces executable Python program for each sub-question; and 3) Answer Generator that generates long-form answer grounded on the program output. Human evaluation results on the FeTaQA and QTSumm datasets indicate that our framework significantly improves strong baselines on both accuracy and truthfulness, as our modular framework is better at table reasoning, and the long-form answer is always consistent with the program output. Our modular design further provides transparency as users are able to interact with our framework by manually changing the content plans.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.692	Yilun Zhao, Lyuhao Chen, Arman Cohan, Chen Zhao
Cheetah: Natural Language Generation for 517 African Languages	Low-resource African languages pose unique challenges for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including natural language generation (NLG). In this paper, we develop Cheetah, a massively multilingual NLG language model for African languages. Cheetah supports 517 African languages and language varieties, allowing us to address the scarcity of NLG resources and provide a solution to foster linguistic diversity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Cheetah through comprehensive evaluations across six generation downstream tasks. In five of the six tasks, Cheetah significantly outperforms other models, showcasing its remarkable performance for generating coherent and contextually appropriate text in a wide range of African languages. We additionally conduct a detailed human evaluation to delve deeper into the linguistic capabilities of Cheetah. The findings of this study contribute to advancing NLP research in low-resource settings, enabling greater accessibility and inclusion for African languages in a rapidly expanding digital landscape. We will publicly release our models for research.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.691	Ife Adebara, AbdelRahim Elmadany, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed
Generating Coherent Sequences of Visual Illustrations for Real-World Manual Tasks	Multistep instructions, such as recipes and how-to guides, greatly benefit from visual aids, such as a series of images that accompany the instruction steps. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become adept at generating coherent textual steps, Large Vision/Language Models (LVLMs) are less capable of generating accompanying image sequences. The most challenging aspect is that each generated image needs to adhere to the relevant textual step instruction, as well as be visually consistent with earlier images in the sequence. To address this problem, we propose an approach for generating consistent image sequences, which integrates a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) with an LLM to transform the sequence into a caption to maintain the semantic coherence of the sequence. In addition, to maintain the visual coherence of the image sequence, we introduce a copy mechanism to initialise reverse diffusion processes with a latent vector iteration from a previously generated image from a relevant step. Both strategies will condition the reverse diffusion process on the sequence of instruction steps and tie the contents of the current image to previous instruction steps and corresponding images. Experiments show that the proposed approach is preferred by humans in 46.6% of the cases against 26.6% for the second best method. In addition, automatic metrics showed that the proposed method maintains semantic coherence and visual consistency across steps in both domains.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.690	João Bordalo, Vasco Ramos, Rodrigo Valério, Diogo Glória-Silva, Yonatan Bitton, Michal Yarom, Idan Szpektor, Joao Magalhaes
GLIMPSE: Pragmatically Informative Multi-Document Summarization for Scholarly Reviews	Scientific peer review is essential for the quality of academic publications. However, the increasing number of paper submissions to conferences has strained the reviewing process. This surge poses a burden on area chairs who have to carefully read an ever-growing volume of reviews and discern each reviewer's main arguments as part of their decision process. In this paper, we introduce , a summarization method designed to offer a concise yet comprehensive overview of scholarly reviews. Unlike traditional consensus-based methods, extracts both common and unique opinions from the reviews. We introduce novel uniqueness scores based on the Rational Speech Act framework to identify relevant sentences in the reviews. Our method aims to provide a pragmatic glimpse into all reviews, offering a balanced perspective on their opinions. Our experimental results with both automatic metrics and human evaluation show that generates more discriminative summaries than baseline methods in terms of human evaluation while achieving comparable performance with these methods in terms of automatic metrics.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.688	Maxime Darrin, Ines Arous, Pablo Piantanida, Jackie Cheung

It is derived from legal judgments from the Court of Justice of the European Union (EU), and contains instances in all 24 EU official languages.

Peacock: A Family of Arabic Multimodal Large Language Models and Benchmarks	Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have proven effective in a wide range of tasks that require complex reasoning and linguistic comprehension. However, due to a lack of high-quality multimodal resources in languages other than English, the success of MLLMs remains relatively limited to English-based settings. This poses significant challenges in developing comparable models for other languages, even those with large speaker populations, such as Arabic. To alleviate this challenge, we introduce a comprehensive family of Arabic MLLMs, dubbed *Peacock*, with strong vision and language capabilities. Through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate the solid performance of our models on various visual reasoning tasks and further show their emerging dialectal potential. Additionally, we introduce *Henna*, a new benchmark specifically designed for assessing MLLMs on aspects related to Arabic culture, setting the first stone for culturally-aware Arabic MLLMs. The GitHub repository for the *Peacock* project is available at [https://github.com/UBC-NLP/peacock](https://github.com/UBC-NLP/peacock).	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.689	Fakhraddin Alwajih, El Moatez Billah Nagoudi, Gagan Bhatia, Abdelrahman Mohamed, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed
COSMIC: Mutual Information for Task-Agnostic Summarization Evaluation	Assessing the quality of summarizers poses significant challenges—gold summaries are hard to obtain and their suitability depends on the use context of the summarization system. Who is the user of the system, and what do they intend to do with the summary? In response, we propose a novel task-oriented evaluation approach that assesses summarizers based on their capacity to produce summaries while preserving task outcomes. We theoretically establish both a lower and upper bound on the expected error rate of these tasks, which depends on the mutual information between source texts and generated summaries. We introduce COSMIC, a practical implementation of this metric, and demonstrate its strong correlation with human judgment-based metrics, as well as its effectiveness in predicting downstream task performance. Comparative analyses against established metrics like BERTScore and ROUGE highlight the competitive performance of COSMIC.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.686	Maxime Darrin, Philippe Formont, Jackie Cheung, Pablo Piantanida
Retaining Key Information under High Compression Ratios: Query-Guided Compressor for LLMs	The growing popularity of Large Language Models has sparked interest in context compression for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the performance of previous methods degrades dramatically as compression ratios increase, sometimes even falling to the closed-book level. This decline can be attributed to the loss of key information during the compression process. Our preliminary study supports this hypothesis, emphasizing the significance of retaining key information to maintain model performance under high compression ratios. As a result, we introduce Query-Guided Compressor (QGC), which leverages queries to guide the context compression process, effectively preserving key information within the compressed context. Additionally, we employ a dynamic compression strategy. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed QGC on the Question Answering task, including NaturalQuestions, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA datasets. Experimental results show that QGC can consistently perform well even at high compression ratios, which also offers significant benefits in terms of inference cost and throughput.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.685	Zhiwei Cao, Qian Cao, Yu Lu, Ningxin Peng, Luyang Huang, Shanbo Cheng, Jinsong Su
A Community-Centric Perspective for Characterizing and Detecting Anti-Asian Violence-Provoking Speech	Violence-provoking speech – speech that implicitly or explicitly promotes violence against the members of the targeted community, contributed to a massive surge in anti-Asian crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic. While previous works have characterized and built tools for detecting other forms of harmful speech, like fear speech and hate speech, our work takes a community-centric approach to studying anti-Asian violence-provoking speech. Using data from ~420k Twitter posts spanning a 3-year duration (January 1, 2020 to February 1, 2023), we develop a codebook to characterize anti-Asian violence-provoking speech and collect a community-crowdsourced dataset to facilitate its large-scale detection using state-of-the-art classifiers. We contrast the capabilities of natural language processing classifiers, ranging from BERT-based to LLM-based classifiers, in detecting violence-provoking speech with their capabilities to detect anti-Asian hateful speech. In contrast to prior work that has demonstrated the effectiveness of such classifiers in detecting hateful speech ( F1 = 0.89), our work shows that accurate and reliable detection of violence-provoking speech is a challenging task ( F1 = 0.69). We discuss the implications of our findings, particularly the need for proactive interventions to support Asian communities during public health crises.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.684	Gaurav Verma, Rynaa Grover, Jiawei Zhou, Binny Mathew, Jordan Kraemer, Munmun Choudhury, Srijan Kumar
ActionIE: Action Extraction from Scientific Literature with Programming Languages	Extraction of experimental procedures from human language in scientific literature and patents into actionable sequences in robotics language holds immense significance in scientific domains. Such an action extraction task is particularly challenging given the intricate details and context-dependent nature of the instructions, especially in fields like chemistry where reproducibility is paramount. In this paper, we introduce ActionIE, a method that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to bridge this divide by converting actions written in natural language into executable Python code. This enables us to capture the entities of interest, and the relationship between each action, given the features of Programming Languages. Utilizing linguistic cues identified by frequent patterns, ActionIE provides an improved mechanism to discern entities of interest. While our method is broadly applicable, we exemplify its power in the domain of chemical literature, wherein we focus on extracting experimental procedures for chemical synthesis. The code generated by our method can be easily transformed into robotics language which is in high demand in scientific fields. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. In addition, we propose a graph-based metric to more accurately reflect the precision of extraction. We also develop a dataset to address the scarcity of scientific literature occurred in existing datasets.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.683	Xianrui Zhong, Yufeng Du, Siru Ouyang, Ming Zhong, Tingfeng Luo, Qirong Ho, Hao Peng, Heng Ji, Jiawei Han
Classist Tools: Social Class Correlates with Performance in NLP	The field of sociolinguistics has studied factors affecting language use for the last century. Labov (1964) and Bernstein (1960) showed that socioeconomic class strongly influences our accents, syntax and lexicon. However, despite growing concerns surrounding fairness and bias in Natural Language Processing (NLP), there is a dearth of studies delving into the effects it may have on NLP systems. We show empirically that NLP systems' performance is affected by speakers' SES, potentially disadvantaging less-privileged socioeconomic groups. We annotate a corpus of 95K utterances from movies with social class, ethnicity and geographical language variety and measure the performance of NLP systems on three tasks: language modelling, automatic speech recognition, and grammar error correction. We find significant performance disparities that can be attributed to socioeconomic status as well as ethnicity and geographical differences. With NLP technologies becoming ever more ubiquitous and quotidian, they must accommodate all language varieties to avoid disadvantaging already marginalised groups. We argue for the inclusion of socioeconomic class in future language technologies.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.682	Amanda Curry, Giuseppe Attanasio, Zeerak Talat, Dirk Hovy
LayerSkip: Enabling Early Exit Inference and Self-Speculative Decoding	We present LayerSkip, an end-to-end solution to speed-up inference of large language models (LLMs). First, during training we apply layer dropout, with low dropout rates for earlier layers and higher dropout rates for later layers, and an early exit loss where all transformer layers share the same exit. Second, during inference, we show that this training recipe increases the accuracy of early exit at earlier layers, without adding any auxiliary layers or modules to the model. Third, we present a novel self-speculative decoding solution where we exit at early layers and verify and correct with remaining layers of the model. Our proposed self-speculative decoding approach has less memory footprint than other speculative decoding approaches and benefits from shared compute and activations of the draft and verification stages. We run experiments on different Llama model sizes on different types of training: pretraining from scratch, continual pretraining, finetuning on specific data domain, and finetuning on specific task. We implement our inference solution and show speedups of up to 2.16x on summarization for CNN/DM documents, 1.82x on coding, and 2.0x on TOPv2 semantic parsing task. We open source our code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/LayerSkip.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.681	Mostafa Elhoushi, Akshat Shrivastava, Diana Liskovich, Basil Hosmer, Bram Wasti, Liangzhen Lai, Anas Mahmoud, Bilge Acun, Saurabh Agarwal, Ahmed Roman, Ahmed Aly, Beidi Chen, Carole-Jean Wu
To Distill or Not to Distill? On the Robustness of Robust Knowledge Distillation	Arabic is known to present unique challengesfor Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Onone hand, its rich linguistic diversity andwide range of dialects complicate the de-velopment of robust, inclusive models. Onthe other, current multilingual ASR modelsare compute-intensive and lack proper com-prehensive evaluations. In light of thesechallenges, we distill knowledge from largeteacher models into smaller student variantsthat more efficient. We also introduce a novelhuman-annotated dataset covering five under-represented Arabic dialects for evaluation. Wefurther evaluate both our models and existingSoTA multilingual models on both standardavailable benchmarks and our new dialectaldata. Our best-distilled model's overall perfor-mance (45.0% WER) surpasses that of a SoTAmodel twice its size (SeamlessM4T-large-v2,WER=47.0%) and its teacher model (Whisper-large-v2, WER=55.1%), and its average perfor-mance on our new dialectal data (56.9% WER)outperforms all other models. To gain more in-sight into the poor performance of these modelson dialectal data, we conduct an error analysisand report the main types of errors the differentmodels tend to make.

Video-ChatGPT: Towards Detailed Video Understanding via Large Vision and Language Models	Conversation agents fueled by Large Language Models (LLMs) are providing a new way to interact with visual data. While there have been initial attempts for image-based conversation models, this work addresses the under-explored field of video-based conversation by introducing Video-ChatGPT. It is a multimodal model that merges a video-adapted visual encoder with an LLM. The resulting model is capable of understanding and generating detailed conversations about videos. We introduce a new dataset of 100,000 video-instruction pairs used to train Video-ChatGPT acquired via manual and semi-automated pipeline that is easily scalable and robust to label noise. We also develop a quantitative evaluation framework for video-based dialogue models to objectively analyze the strengths and weaknesses of video-based dialogue models.

LLM in a flash: Efficient Large Language Model Inference with Limited Memory	"Large language models (LLMs) are central to modern natural language processing, delivering exceptional performance in various tasks. However, their substantial computational and memory requirements present challenges, especially for devices with limited DRAM capacity. This paper tackles the challenge of efficiently running LLMs that exceed the available DRAM capacity by storing the model parameters in flash memory, but bringing them on demand to DRAM. Our method involves constructing an inference cost model that takes into account the characteristics of flash memory, guiding us to optimize in two critical areas: reducing the volume of data transferred from flash and reading data in larger, more contiguous chunks. Within this hardware-informed framework, we introduce two principal techniques. First, ""windowing"" strategically reduces data transfer by reusing previously activated neurons, and second, ""row-column bundling"", tailored to the sequential data access strengths of flash memory, increases the size of data chunks read from flash memory. These methods collectively enable running models up to twice the size of the available DRAM, with a 4-5x and 20-25x increase in inference speed compared to naive loading approaches in CPU and GPU, respectively. Our integration of sparsity awareness, context-adaptive loading, and a hardware-oriented design paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.678	Keivan Alizadeh, Seyed Iman Mirzadeh, Dmitry Belenko, S.

Analyzing LLM Behavior in Dialogue Summarization: Unveiling Circumstantial Hallucination Trends	"Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the capabilities of summarization systems.However, they continue to face a persistent challenge: hallucination. While prior work has extensively examined LLMs in news domains, evaluation of dialogue summarization has primarily focused on BART-based models, resulting in a notable gap in understanding LLM effectiveness.Our work seeks to address this gap by benchmarking LLMs for dialogue summarization faithfulness using human annotations,focusing on identifying and categorizing span-level inconsistencies.Specifically, we evaluate two prominent LLMs: GPT-4 and Alpaca-13B.Our evaluation reveals that LLMs often generate plausible, but not fully supported inferences based on conversation contextual cues, a trait absent in older models. As a result, we propose a refined taxonomy of errors, introducing a novel category termed ""Contextual Inference"" to address this aspect of LLM behavior. Using our taxonomy, we compare the behavioral differences between LLMs and older fine-tuned models. Additionally, we systematically assess the efficacy of automatic error detection methods on LLM summaries and find that they struggle to detect these nuanced errors effectively. To address this, we introduce two prompt-based approaches for fine-grained error detection. Our methods outperform existing metrics, particularly in identifying the novel ""Contextual Inference"" error type."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.677	Sanjana Ramprasad, Elisa Ferracane, Zachary Lipton
On the Representational Capacity of Neural Language Models with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning	The performance of modern language models (LMs) has been improved by chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, i.e., the process of generating intermediate results that guide the model towards a final answer. A possible explanation for this improvement is that CoT reasoning extends an LM's computational power, as RNNs and transformers with additional scratch space are known to be Turing complete. Comparing LMs to Turing machines, however, introduces a category error—Turing machines decide language membership, whereas LMs define distributions over strings. To bridge this gap, we formalize CoT reasoning in a probabilistic setting. We present several results on the representational capacity of recurrent and transformer LMs with CoT reasoning, showing that they can represent the same family of distributions over strings as probabilistic Turing machines.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.676	Franz Nowak, Anej Svete, Alexandra Butoi, Ryan Cotterell
Silent Signals, Loud Impact: LLMs for Word-Sense Disambiguation of Coded Dog Whistles	A dog whistle is a form of coded communication that carries a secondary meaning to specific audiences and is often weaponized for racial and socioeconomic discrimination. Dog whistling historically originated from United States politics, but in recent years has taken root in social media as a means of evading hate speech detection systems and maintaining plausible deniability. In this paper, we present an approach for word-sense disambiguation of dog whistles from standard speech using Large Language Models (LLMs), and leverage this technique to create a dataset of 16,550 high-confidence coded examples of dog whistles used in formal and informal communication. Silent Signals is the largest dataset of disambiguated dog whistle usage, created for applications in hate speech detection, neology, and political science.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.675	Julia Kruk, Michela Marchini, Rijul Magu, Caleb Ziems, David Muchlinski, Diyi Yang
RAID: A Shared Benchmark for Robust Evaluation of Machine-Generated Text Detectors	Many commercial and open-source models claim to detect machine-generated text with extremely high accuracy (99% or more). However, very few of these detectors are evaluated on shared benchmark datasets and even when they are, the datasets used for evaluation are insufficiently challenging—lacking variations in sampling strategy, adversarial attacks, and open-source generative models. In this work we present RAID: the largest and most challenging benchmark dataset for machine-generated text detection. RAID includes over 6 million generations spanning 11 models, 8 domains, 11 adversarial attacks and 4 decoding strategies. Using RAID, we evaluate the out-of-domain and adversarial robustness of 8 open- and 4 closed-source detectors and find that current detectors are easily fooled by adversarial attacks, variations in sampling strategies, repetition penalties, and unseen generative models. We release our data along with a leaderboard to encourage future research.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.674	Liam Dugan, Alyssa Hwang, Filip Trhlík, Andrew Zhu, Josh Magnus Ludan, Hainiu Xu, Daphne Ippolito, Chris Callison-Burch
VoiceCraft: Zero-Shot Speech Editing and Text-to-Speech in the Wild	We introduce VoiceCraft, a token infilling neural codec language model, that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both speech editing and zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) on audiobooks, internet videos, and podcasts. VoiceCraft employs a Transformer decoder architecture and introduces a token rearrangement procedure that combines causal masking and delayed stacking to enable generation within an existing sequence. On speech editing tasks, VoiceCraft produces edited speech that is nearly indistinguishable from unedited recordings in terms of naturalness, as evaluated by humans; for zero-shot TTS, our model outperforms prior SotA models including VALL-E and the popular commercial model XTTS v2. Crucially, the models are evaluated on challenging and realistic datasets, that consist of diverse accents, speaking styles, recording conditions, and background noise and music, and our model performs consistently well compared to other models and real recordings. In particular, for speech editing evaluation, we introduce a high quality, challenging, and realistic dataset named .

More Victories, Less Cooperation: Assessing Cicero’s Diplomacy Play	The boardgame Diplomacy is a challenging setting for communicative and cooperative artificial intelligence. The most prominent communicative Diplomacy AI, Cicero, has excellent strategic abilities, exceeding human players. However, the best Diplomacy players master communication, not just tactics, which is why the game has received attention as an AI challenge. This work seeks to understand the degree to which Cicero succeeds at communication. First, we annotate in-game communication with abstract meaning representation to separate in-game tactics from general language. Second, we run two dozen games with humans and Cicero, totaling over 200 human-player hours of competition. While AI can consistently outplay human players, AI-Human communication is still limited because of AI's difficulty with deception and persuasion. This shows that Cicero relies on strategy and has not yet reached the full promise of communicative and cooperative AI.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.672	Wichayaporn Wongkamjan, Feng Gu, Yanze Wang, Ulf Hermjakob, Jonathan May, Brandon Stewart, Jonathan Kummerfeld, Denis Peskoff, Jordan Boyd-Graber
Investigating Cultural Alignment of Large Language Models	The intricate relationship between language and culture has long been a subject of exploration within the realm of linguistic anthropology. Large Language Models (LLMs), promoted as repositories of collective human knowledge, raise a pivotal question: do these models genuinely encapsulate the diverse knowledge adopted by different cultures? Our study reveals that these models demonstrate greater cultural alignment along two dimensions—firstly, when prompted with the dominant language of a specific culture, and secondly, when pretrained with a refined mixture of languages employed by that culture. We quantify cultural alignment by simulating sociological surveys, comparing model responses to those of actual survey participants as references. Specifically, we replicate a survey conducted in various regions of Egypt and the United States through prompting LLMs with different pretraining data mixtures in both Arabic and English with the personas of the real respondents and the survey questions. Further analysis reveals that misalignment becomes more pronounced for underrepresented personas and for culturally sensitive topics, such as those probing social values. Finally, we introduce Anthropological Prompting, a novel method leveraging anthropological reasoning to enhance cultural alignment. Our study emphasizes the necessity for a more balanced multilingual pretraining dataset to better represent the diversity of human experience and the plurality of different cultures with many implications on the topic of cross-lingual transfer.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.671	Badr AlKhamissi, Muhammad ElNokrashy, Mai Alkhamissi, Mona Diab
Agent Lumos: Unified and Modular Training for Open-Source Language Agents	Closed-source agents suffer from several issues such as a lack of affordability, transparency, and reproducibility, particularly on complex interactive tasks. This motivates the development of open-source alternatives. We introduce Lumos, one of the first frameworks for training open-source LLM-based agents. Lumos features a learnable, unified and modular architecture with a planning module that learns high-level subgoal generation, and a grounding module trained to translate these into the actions using various tools in the execution module. The design allows for modular upgrades and wider applicability to diverse interactive tasks. To foster generalizable agent learning, we collect large-scale, unified, and high-quality training annotations derived from diverse ground-truth reasoning rationales across various complex interactive tasks. On 9 datasets, Lumos exhibits several key advantages: (1) Lumos excels multiple larger open-source agents on the held-out datasets (unused for training) for each task type. Lumos even surpasses GPT agents on QA and web tasks; (2) Lumos outperforms open-source agents produced by chain-of-thoughts and unmodularized integrated training; and (3) Lumos effectively generalizes to unseen tasks, outperforming 33B-scale agents and domain-specific agents. Code and data will be released.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.670	Da Yin, Faeze Brahman, Abhilasha Ravichander, Khyathi Chandu, Kai-Wei Chang, Yejin Choi, Bill Yuchen Lin
What Do Language Models Learn in Context? The Structured Task Hypothesis.	Large language models (LLMs) exhibit an intriguing ability to learn a novel task from in-context examples presented in a demonstration, termed in-context learning (ICL). Understandably, a swath of research has been dedicated to uncovering the theories underpinning ICL. One popular hypothesis explains ICL by task selection. LLMs identify the task based on the demonstration and generalize it to the prompt. Another popular hypothesis is that ICL is a form of meta-learning, i.e., the models learn a learning algorithm at pre-training time and apply it to the demonstration. Finally, a third hypothesis argues that LLMs use the demonstration to select a composition of tasks learned during pre-training to perform ICL. In this paper, we empirically explore these three hypotheses that explain LLMs' ability to learn in context with a suite of experiments derived from common text classification tasks. We invalidate the first two hypotheses with counterexamples and provide evidence in support of the last hypothesis. Our results suggest an LLM could learn a novel task in context via composing tasks learned during pre-training.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.669	Jiaoda Li, Yifan Hou, Mrinmaya Sachan, Ryan Cotterell
Transferable and Efficient Non-Factual Content Detection via Probe Training with Offline Consistency Checking	This paper proposes PiNose, which trains a probing model on offline self-consistency checking results, thereby circumventing the need for human-annotated data and achieving transferability across diverse data distributions. As the consistency check process is offline, PiNose reduces the computational burden of generating multiple responses by online consistency verification. Additionally, it examines various aspects of internal states prior to response decoding, contributing to more effective detection of factual inaccuracies. Experiment results on both factuality detection and question answering benchmarks show that PiNose achieves surpassing results than existing factuality detection methods.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.668	Xiaokang Zhang, Zijun Yao, Jing Zhang, Kaifeng Yun, Jifan Yu, Juanzi Li, Jie Tang
Structured Tree Alignment for Evaluation of (Speech) Constituency Parsing	We present the structured average intersection-over-union ratio (STRUCT-IOU), an evaluation metric that compares a constituency parse tree over automatically recognized spoken word boundaries with the ground-truth parse tree over written words. To compute the metric, we (1) project the ground-truth parse tree to the speech domain by forced alignment, (2) align the projected ground-truth constituents with the predicted ones under certain structured constraints, and (3) calculate the average IOU score across all aligned constituent pairs. STRUCT-IOU takes word boundaries into account and overcomes the challenge that the predicted words and ground truth may not have perfect one-to-one correspondence. Extending to the evaluation of text constituency parsing, we demonstrate that STRUCT-IOU shows higher tolerance to syntactically plausible parses than PARSEVAL (Black et al., 1991).	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.666	Freda Shi, Kevin Gimpel, Karen Livescu
ViSAGe: A Global-Scale Analysis of Visual Stereotypes in Text-to-Image Generation	Recent studies have shown that Text-to-Image (T2I) model generations can reflect social stereotypes present in the real world. However, existing approaches for evaluating stereotypes have a noticeable lack of coverage of global identity groups and their associated stereotypes. To address this gap, we introduce the ViSAGe (Visual Stereotypes Around the Globe) dataset to enable the evaluation of known nationality-based stereotypes in T2I models, across 135 nationalities. We enrich an existing textual stereotype resource by distinguishing between stereotypical associations that are more likely to have visual depictions, such as 'sombrero', from those that are less visually concrete, such as 'attractive'. We demonstrate ViSAGe's utility through a multi-faceted evaluation of T2I generations. First, we show that stereotypical attributes in ViSAGe are thrice as likely to be present in generated images of corresponding identities as compared to other attributes, and that the offensiveness of these depictions is especially higher for identities from Africa, South America, and South East Asia. Second, we assess the 'stereotypical pull' of visual depictions of identity groups, which reveals how the 'default' representations of all identity groups in ViSAGe have a pull towards stereotypical depictions, and that this pull is even more prominent for identity groups from the Global South. CONTENT WARNING: Some examples contain offensive stereotypes.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.667	Akshita Jha, Vinodkumar Prabhakaran, Remi Denton, Sarah Laszlo, Shachi Dave, Rida Qadri, Chandan Reddy, Sunipa Dev
Tree-of-Traversals: A Zero-Shot Reasoning Algorithm for Augmenting Black-box Language Models with Knowledge Graphs	Knowledge graphs (KGs) complement Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing reliable, structured, domain-specific, and up-to-date external knowledge. However, KGs and LLMs are often developed separately and must be integrated after training. We introduce Tree-of-Traversals, a novel zero-shot reasoning algorithm that enables augmentation of black-box LLMs with one or more KGs. The algorithm equips a LLM with actions for interfacing a KG and enables the LLM to perform tree search over possible thoughts and actions to find high confidence reasoning paths. Tree-of-Traversals significantly improves performance on question answering and KG question answering tasks.

Tree Transformer’s Disambiguation Ability of Prepositional Phrase Attachment and Garden Path Effects	This work studies two types of ambiguity in natural language: prepositional phrase (PP) attachment ambiguity, and garden path constructions. Due to the different nature of these ambiguities – one being structural, the other incremental in nature – we pretrain and evaluate the Tree Transformer of Wang et al. (2019), an unsupervised Transformer model that induces tree representations internally. To assess PP attachment ambiguity we inspect the model's induced parse trees against a newly prepared dataset derived from the PP attachment corpus (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994). Measuring garden path effects is done by considering surprisal rates of the underlying language model on a number of dedicated test suites, following Futrell et al. (2019). For comparison we evaluate a pretrained supervised BiLSTM-based model trained on constituency parsing as sequence labelling (Gómez-Rodríguez and Vilares, 2018). Results show that the unsupervised Tree Transformer does exhibit garden path effects, but its parsing ability is far inferior to the supervised BiLSTM, and it is not as sensitive to lexical cues as other large LSTM models, suggesting that supervised parsers based on a pre-Transformer architecture may be the better choice in the presence of ambiguity.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.664	Lingling Zhou, Suzan Verberne, Gijs Wijnholds
VIEScore: Towards Explainable Metrics for Conditional Image Synthesis Evaluation	In the rapidly advancing field of conditional image generation research, challenges such as limited explainability lie in effectively evaluating the performance and capabilities of various models. This paper introduces VIEScore, a Visual Instruction-guided Explainable metric for evaluating any conditional image generation tasks. VIEScore leverages general knowledge from Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as the backbone and does not require training or fine-tuning. We evaluate VIEScore on seven prominent tasks in conditional image tasks and found: (1) VIEScore (GPT4-o) achieves a high Spearman correlation of 0.4 with human evaluations, while the human-to-human correlation is 0.45. (2) VIEScore (with open-source MLLM) is significantly weaker than GPT-4o and GPT-4v in evaluating synthetic images. (3) VIEScore achieves a correlation on par with human ratings in the generation tasks but struggles in editing tasks. With these results, we believe VIEScore shows its great potential to replace human judges in evaluating image synthesis tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.663	Max Ku, Dongfu Jiang, Cong Wei, Xiang Yue, Wenhu Chen
Back to Basics: Revisiting REINFORCE-Style Optimization for Learning from Human Feedback in LLMs	"AI alignment in the shape of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly treated as a crucial ingredient for high performance large language models. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has been installed by the seminal literature as the standard method for the RL part of RLHF. However, it involves both high computational cost and sensitive hyperparameter tuning. We posit that most of the motivational principles that led to the development of PPO are less of a practical concern in RLHF and advocate for a less computationally expensive method that preserves and even increases performance. We revisit how alignment from human preferences is formulated in the context of RL. Keeping simplicity as a guiding principle, we show that many components of PPO are unnecessary in an RLHF context and that far simpler REINFORCE-style optimization variants outperform both PPO and newly proposed ""RL-free"" methods such as DPO and RAFT. Our work suggests that careful adaptation to LLMs alignment characteristics allows benefiting from online RL optimization at low cost."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.662	Arash Ahmadian, Chris Cremer, Matthias Gallé, Marzieh Fadaee, Julia Kreutzer, Olivier Pietquin, Ahmet Üstün, Sara Hooker
Search-Adaptor: Embedding Customization for Information Retrieval	Embeddings extracted by pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant potential to improve information retrieval and search. Beyond the zero-shot setup in which they are being conventionally used, being able to take advantage of the information from the relevant query-corpus paired data can further boost the LLM capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Search-Adaptor, for customizing LLMs for information retrieval in an efficient and robust way. Search-Adaptor modifies the embeddings generated by pre-trained LLMs, and can be integrated with any LLM, including those only available via prediction APIs. On multiple English, multilingual, and multimodal retrieval datasets, we show consistent and significant performance benefits for Search-Adaptor – e.g., more than 5% improvements for Google Embedding APIs in nDCG@10 averaged over 14 BEIR datasets.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.661	Jinsung Yoon, Yanfei Chen, Sercan Arik, Tomas Pfister
Multipath parsing in the brain	Humans understand sentences word-by-word, in the order that they hear them. This incrementality entails resolving temporary ambiguities about syntactic relationships. We investigate how humans process these syntactic ambiguities by correlating predictions from incremental generative dependency parsers with timecourse data from people undergoing functional neuroimaging while listening to an audiobook. In particular, we compare competing hypotheses regarding the number of developing syntactic analyses in play during word-by-word comprehension: one vs more than one. This comparison involves evaluating syntactic surprisal from a state-of-the-art dependency parser with LLM-adapted encodings against an existing fMRI dataset. In both English and Chinese data, we find evidence for multipath parsing. Brain regions associated with this multipath effect include bilateral superior temporal gyrus.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.660	Berta Franzluebbers, Donald Dunagan, Miloš Stanojević, Jan Buys, John Hale
AutoDSL: Automated domain-specific language design for structural representation of procedures with constraints	Accurate representation of procedures in restricted scenarios, such as non-standardized scientific experiments, requires precise depiction of constraints. Unfortunately, Domain-specific Language (DSL), as an effective tool to express constraints structurally, often requires case-by-case hand-crafting, necessitating customized, labor-intensive efforts. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the AutoDSL framework to automate DSL-based constraint design across various domains. Utilizing domain specified experimental protocol corpora, AutoDSL optimizes syntactic constraints and abstracts semantic constraints. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the DSLs designed by AutoDSL across five distinct domains highlight its potential as an auxiliary module for language models, aiming to improve procedural planning and execution.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.659	Yu-Zhe Shi, Haofei Hou, Zhangqian Bi, Fanxu Meng, Xiang Wei, Lecheng Ruan, Qining Wang
VisDiaHalBench: A Visual Dialogue Benchmark For Diagnosing Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models	Despite the significant success of large vision-language models (LVLMs), some studies have revealed that LVLMs suffer from the hallucination problem, where the LVLMs' response contains descriptions of non-existent objects. Although various benchmarks have been proposed to investigate this problem, they mostly focus on single-turn evaluation and overlook the hallucination raised by textual inputs. To investigate the hallucination problem of LVLMs when given long-term misleading textual history, we propose a novel visual dialogue hallucination evaluation benchmark VisDiaHalBench. The benchmark consists of samples with five-turn questions about an edited image and its original version. VisDiaHalBench differs from previous hallucination benchmarks in the following three points: 1) The questions and answers are unambiguously grounded by annotated scene graphs. 2) The images are uncommonly edited to inspect the visual model and common-object hallucination in LLMs. 3) The carefully designed dialogue refers a same object in different turns to assess the image consistency and influence of history for LVLMs. The detailed analysis of several state-of-the-art LVLMs across image consistency, visual understanding, history influence, and other dimensions reveals their substantial performance gap with single-turn VQA tasks.

A Joint Coreference-Aware Approach to Document-Level Target Sentiment Analysis	Most existing work on aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) focuses on the sentence level, while research at the document level has not received enough attention. Compared to sentence-level ABSA, the document-level ABSA is not only more practical but also requires holistic document-level understanding capabilities such as coreference resolution. To investigate the impact of coreference information on document-level ABSA, we conduct a three-stage research for the document-level target sentiment analysis (DTSA) task: 1) exploring the effectiveness of coreference information for the DTSA task; 2) reducing the reliance on manually annotated coreference information; 3) alleviating the evaluation bias caused by missing the coreference information of opinion targets. Specifically, we first manually annotate the coreferential opinion targets and propose a multi-task learning framework to jointly model the DTSA task and the coreference resolution task. Then we annotate the coreference information with ChatGPT for joint training. Finally, to address the issue of missing coreference targets, we modify the metrics from strict matching to a loose matching method based on the clusters of targets. The experimental results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework but also reflect the feasibility of using ChatGPT-annotated coreferential entities and the applicability of the modified metrics.

LANDeRMT: Dectecting and Routing Language-Aware Neurons for Selectively Finetuning LLMs to Machine Translation	Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results in multilingual translation even with limited bilingual supervision. The major challenges are catastrophic forgetting and parameter interference for finetuning LLMs when provided parallel training data. To address these challenges, we propose LANDeRMT, a Language-Aware Neuron Detecting and Routing framework that selectively finetunes LLMs to Machine Translation with diverse translation training data. In LANDeRMT, we evaluate the awareness of neurons to MT tasks and categorize them into language-general and language-specific neurons. This categorization enables selective parameter updates during finetuning, mitigating parameter interference and catastrophic forgetting issues. For the detected neurons, we further propose a conditional awareness-based routing mechanism to dynamically adjust language-general and language-specific capacity within LLMs, guided by translation signals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LANDeRMT is very effective in learning translation knowledge, significantly improving translation quality over various strong baselines for multiple language pairs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.656	Shaolin Zhu, Leiyu Pan, Bo Li, Deyi Xiong
One Prompt To Rule Them All: LLMs for Opinion Summary Evaluation	Evaluation of opinion summaries using conventional reference-based metrics often fails to provide a comprehensive assessment and exhibits limited correlation with human judgments. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as reference-free metrics for NLG evaluation, their potential remains unexplored for opinion summary evaluation. Furthermore, the absence of sufficient opinion summary evaluation datasets hinders progress in this area. In response, we introduce the SUMMEVAL-OP dataset, encompassing 7 dimensions crucial to the evaluation of opinion summaries: fluency, coherence, relevance, faithfulness, aspect coverage, sentiment consistency, and specificity. We propose OP-I-PROMPT, a dimension-independent prompt, along with OP-PROMPTS, a dimension-dependent set of prompts for opinion summary evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate that OP-I-PROMPT emerges as a good alternative for evaluating opinion summaries, achieving an average Spearman correlation of 0.70 with human judgments, surpassing prior methodologies. Remarkably, we are the first to explore the efficacy of LLMs as evaluators, both on closed-source and open-source models, in the opinion summary evaluation domain.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.655	Tejpalsingh Siledar, Swaroop Nath, Sankara Muddu, Rupasai Rangaraju, Swaprava Nath, Pushpak Bhattacharyya, Suman Banerjee, Amey Patil, Sudhanshu Singh, Muthusamy Chelliah, Nikesh Garera
Generating and Evaluating Plausible Explanations for Knowledge Graph Completion	Explanations for AI should aid human users, yet this ultimate goal remains under-explored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the specific explanatory needs of human users in the context of Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) systems. In contrast to the prevailing approaches that primarily focus on mathematical theories, we recognize the potential limitations of explanations that may end up being overly complex or nonsensical for users. Through in-depth user interviews, we gain valuable insights into the types of KGC explanations users seek. Building upon these insights, we introduce GradPath, a novel path-based explanation method designed to meet human-centric explainability constraints and enhance plausibility. Additionally, GradPath harnesses the gradients of the trained KGC model to maintain a certain level of faithfulness. We verify the effectiveness of GradPath through well-designed human-centric evaluations. The results confirm that our method provides explanations that users consider more plausible than previous ones.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.654	Antonio Di Mauro, Zhao Xu, Wiem Ben Rim, Timo Sztyler, Carolin Lawrence

This work introduces QE-fusion, a method that synthesizes translations using a quality estimation metric (QE), which correlates better with human judgments. QE-fusion leverages a pool of candidates sampled from a model, combining spans from different candidates using a QE metric such as CometKiwi. We compare QE-fusion against beam search and recent reranking techniques, such as Minimum Bayes Risk decoding or QE-reranking. Our method consistently improves translation quality in terms of COMET and BLEURT scores when applied to large language models (LLMs) used for translation (PolyLM, XGLM, Llama2, Mistral, ALMA, and Tower) and to multilingual translation models (NLLB), over five language pairs. Notably, QE-fusion exhibits larger improvements for LLMs due to their ability to generate diverse outputs. We demonstrate that our approach generates novel translations in over half of the cases and consistently outperforms other methods across varying numbers of candidates (5–200). Furthermore, we empirically establish that QE-fusion scales linearly with the number of candidates in the pool.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.653	Giorgos Vernikos, Andrei Popescu-Belis
Don’t Go To Extremes: Revealing the Excessive Sensitivity and Calibration Limitations of LLMs in Implicit Hate Speech Detection	The fairness and trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) are receiving increasing attention. Implicit hate speech, which employs indirect language to convey hateful intentions, occupies a significant portion of practice. However, the extent to which LLMs effectively address this issue remains insufficiently examined. This paper delves into the capability of LLMs to detect implicit hate speech and express confidence in their responses. Our evaluation meticulously considers various prompt patterns and mainstream uncertainty estimation methods. Our findings highlight that LLMs exhibit two extremes: (1) LLMs display excessive sensitivity towards groups or topics that may cause fairness issues, resulting in misclassifying benign statements as hate speech. (2) LLMs' confidence scores for each method excessively concentrate on a fixed range, remaining unchanged regardless of the dataset's complexity. Consequently, the calibration performance is heavily reliant on primary classification accuracy. These discoveries unveil new limitations of LLMs, underscoring the need for caution when optimizing models to ensure they do not veer towards extremes. This serves as a reminder to carefully consider sensitivity and confidence in the pursuit of model fairness.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.652	Min Zhang, Jianfeng He, Taoran Ji, Chang-Tien Lu
Beyond Traditional Benchmarks: Analyzing Behaviors of Open LLMs on Data-to-Text Generation	We analyze the behaviors of open large language models (LLMs) on the task of data-to-text (D2T) generation, i.e., generating coherent and relevant text from structured data. To avoid the issue of LLM training data contamination with standard benchmarks, we design Quintd - a tool for collecting novel structured data records from public APIs. We find that open LLMs (Llama 2, Mistral, and Zephyr) can generate fluent and coherent texts in zero-shot settings from data in common formats collected with Quintd. However, we show that the semantic accuracy of the outputs is a major issue: both according to human annotators and our reference-free metric based on GPT-4, more than 80% of the outputs of open LLMs contain at least one semantic error. We publicly release the code, data, and model outputs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.651	Zdeněk Kasner, Ondrej Dusek
GunStance: Stance Detection for Gun Control and Gun Regulation	"The debate surrounding gun control and gun regulation in the United States has intensified in the wake of numerous mass shooting events. As perspectives on this matter vary, it becomes increasingly important to comprehend individuals' positions. Stance detection, the task of determining an author's position towards a proposition or target, has gained attention for its potential use in understanding public perceptions towards controversial topics and identifying the best strategies to address public concerns. In this paper, we present GunStance, a dataset of tweets pertaining to shooting events, focusing specifically on the controversial topics of ""banning guns"" versus ""regulating guns."" The tweets in the dataset are sourced from discussions on Twitter following various shooting incidents in the United States. Amazon Mechanical Turk was used to manually annotate a subset of the tweets relevant to the targets of interest (""banning guns"" and ""regulating guns"") into three classes: In-Favor, Against, and Neutral. The remaining unlabeled tweets are included in the dataset to facilitate studies on semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches that can help address the scarcity of the labeled data in stance detection tasks. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid approach that combines curriculum-based SSL and Large Language Models (LLM), and show that the proposed approach outperforms supervised, semi-supervised, and LLM-based zero-shot models in most experiments on our assembled dataset."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.650	Nikesh Gyawali, Iustin Sirbu, Tiberiu Sosea, Sarthak Khanal, Doina Caragea, Traian Rebedea, Cornelia Caragea
mCoT: Multilingual Instruction Tuning for Reasoning Consistency in Language Models	Large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-thought (CoT) have recently emerged as a powerful technique for eliciting reasoning to improve various downstream tasks. As most research mainly focuses on English, with few explorations in a multilingual context, the question of how reliable this reasoning capability is in different languages is still open. To address it directly, we study multilingual reasoning consistency across multiple languages, using popular open-source LLMs. First, we compile the first large-scale multilingual math reasoning dataset, *mCoT-MATH*, covering eleven diverse languages. Then, we introduce multilingual CoT instruction tuning to boost reasoning capability across languages, thereby improving model consistency. While existing LLMs show substantial variation across the languages we consider, and especially low performance for lesser resourced languages, our 7B parameter model *mCoT* achieves impressive consistency across languages, and superior or comparable performance to close- and open-source models even of much larger sizes.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.649	Huiyuan Lai, Malvina Nissim
Investigating and Mitigating the Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing in Large Vision-Language Models	Though advanced in understanding visual information with human languages, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer from multimodal hallucinations. A natural concern is that during multimodal interaction, the generated hallucinations could influence the LVLMs' subsequent generation. Thus, we raise a question: When presented with a query relevant to the previously generated hallucination, will LVLMs be misled and respond incorrectly, even though the ground visual information exists? To answer this, we propose a framework called \\textitMMHalSnowball to evaluate LVLMs' behaviors when encountering generated hallucinations, where LVLMs are required to answer specific visual questions within a curated hallucinatory conversation. Crucially, our experiment shows that the performance of open-source LVLMs drops by at least 31\\% , indicating that LVLMs are prone to accept the generated hallucinations and make false claims that they would not have supported without distractions. We term this Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing . To mitigate this issue, we further propose a training-free method called Residual Visual Decoding, where we revise the output distribution of LVLMs with the one derived from the residual visual input, providing models with direct access to the visual information. Experiments show that our method can mitigate more than 24\\% of the snowballed multimodal hallucination while maintaining capabilities.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.648	Weihong Zhong, Xiaocheng Feng, Liang Zhao, Qiming Li, Lei Huang, Yuxuan Gu, Weitao Ma, Yuan Xu, Bing Qin
LLMs Learn Task Heuristics from Demonstrations: A Heuristic-Driven Prompting Strategy for Document-Level Event Argument Extraction	In this study, we explore in-context learning (ICL) in document-level event argument extraction (EAE) to alleviate the dependency on large-scale labeled data for this task. We introduce the Heuristic-Driven Link-of-Analogy (HD-LoA) prompting tailored for the EAE task. Specifically, we hypothesize and validate that LLMs learn task-specific heuristics from demonstrations in ICL. Building upon this hypothesis, we introduce an explicit heuristic-driven demonstration construction approach, which transforms the haphazard example selection process into a systematic method that emphasizes task heuristics. Additionally, inspired by the analogical reasoning of human, we propose the link-of-analogy prompting, which enables LLMs to process new situations by drawing analogies to known situations, enhancing their performance on unseen classes beyond limited ICL examples. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing prompting methods and few-shot supervised learning methods on document-level EAE datasets. Additionally, the HD-LoA prompting shows effectiveness in other tasks like sentiment analysis and natural language inference, demonstrating its broad adaptability.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.647	Hanzhang Zhou, Junlang Qian, Zijian Feng, Lu Hui, Zixiao Zhu, Kezhi Mao
PairCFR: Enhancing Model Training on Paired Counterfactually Augmented Data through Contrastive Learning	Counterfactually Augmented Data (CAD) involves creating new data samples by applying minimal yet sufficient modifications to flip the label of existing data samples to other classes. Training with CAD enhances model robustness against spurious features that happen to correlate with labels by spreading the casual relationships across different classes. Yet, recent research reveals that training with CAD may lead models to overly focus on modified features while ignoring other important contextual information, inadvertently introducing biases that may impair performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. To mitigate this issue, we employ contrastive learning to promote global feature alignment in addition to learning counterfactual clues. We theoretically prove that contrastive loss can encourage models to leverage a broader range of features beyond those modified ones. Comprehensive experiments on two human-edited CAD datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art on OOD datasets.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.646	Xiaoqi Qiu, Yongjie Wang, Xu Guo, Zhiwei Zeng, Yu Yue, Yuhong Feng, Chunyan Miao
Document-level Claim Extraction and Decontextualisation for Fact-Checking	Selecting which claims to check is a time-consuming task for human fact-checkers, especially from documents consisting of multiple sentences and containing multiple claims. However, existing claim extraction approaches focus more on identifying and extracting claims from individual sentences, e.g., identifying whether a sentence contains a claim or the exact boundaries of the claim within a sentence. In this paper, we propose a method for document-level claim extraction for fact-checking, which aims to extract check-worthy claims from documents and decontextualise them so that they can be understood out of context. Specifically, we first recast claim extraction as extractive summarization in order to identify central sentences from documents, then rewrite them to include necessary context from the originating document through sentence decontextualisation. Evaluation with both automatic metrics and a fact-checking professional shows that our method is able to extract check-worthy claims from documents at a higher rate than previous work, while also improving evidence retrieval.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.645	Zhenyun Deng, Michael Schlichtkrull, Andreas Vlachos
UltraLink: An Open-Source Knowledge-Enhanced Multilingual Supervised Fine-tuning Dataset	Open-source large language models (LLMs) have gained significant strength across diverse fields. Nevertheless, the majority of studies primarily concentrate on English, with only limited exploration into the realm of multilingual abilities.In this work, we therefore construct an open-source multilingual supervised fine-tuning dataset.Different from previous works that simply translate English instructions, we consider both the language-specific and language-agnostic abilities of LLMs. Firstly, we introduce a knowledge-grounded data augmentation approach to elicit more language-specific knowledge of LLMs, improving their ability to serve users from different countries. Moreover, we find modern LLMs possess strong cross-lingual transfer capabilities, thus repeatedly learning identical content in various languages is not necessary. Consequently, we can substantially prune the language-agnostic supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data without any performance degradation, making multilingual SFT more efficient.The resulting UltraLink dataset comprises approximately 1 million samples across five languages (i.e., En, Zh, Ru, Fr, Es), and the proposed data construction method can be easily extended to other languages.UltraLink-LM, which is trained on the UltraLink dataset, outperforms several representative baselines across many tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.644	Haoyu Wang, Shuo Wang, Yukun Yan, Xujia Wang, Zhiyu Yang, Yuzhuang Xu, Zhenghao Liu, Liner Yang, Ning Ding, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun
Self-Training with Direct Preference Optimization Improves Chain-of-Thought Reasoning	Teaching small-scale language models to perform math reasoning is a valuable yet challenging task. Besides obtaining labeled data from human experts, one of the most common ways to collect high-quality data is by sampling from a larger and more powerful language model. Although previous works have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method, such a knowledge distillation paradigm can be costly and unstable, especially considering that many large language models, such as GPT-4, are closed-sourced, proprietary, and their behaviors are unpredictable. In this work, to avoid relying on outputs from large models, we demonstrate that the reasoning abilities of small-scale language models can be enhanced through self-training, which involves training models with their own outputs. We also show that the vanilla self-training can be further augmented by an alignment algorithm, direct preference optimization (DPO). We empirically found that models trained with the DPO objective are capable of making better generations that largely benefit multi-turn self-training. The experiments show our models outperform the state-of-the-art models with comparable sizes on a series of downstream math reasoning tasks with minimal resource requirements.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.643	Tianduo Wang, Shichen Li, Wei Lu
Improving Text Embeddings with Large Language Models	In this paper, we introduce a novel and simple method for obtaining high-quality text embeddings using only synthetic data and less than 1k training steps. Unlike existing methods that often depend on multi-stage intermediate pre-training with billions of weakly-supervised text pairs, followed by fine-tuning with a few labeled datasets, our method does not require building complex training pipelines or relying on manually collected datasets that are often constrained by task diversity and language coverage. We leverage proprietary LLMs to generate diverse synthetic data for hundreds of thousands of text embedding tasks across 93 languages. We then fine-tune open-source decoder-only LLMs on the synthetic data using standard contrastive loss. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong performance on highly competitive text embedding benchmarks without using any labeled data. Furthermore, when fine-tuned with a mixture of synthetic and labeled data, our model sets new state-of-the-art results on the BEIR and MTEB benchmarks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.642	Liang Wang, Nan Yang, Xiaolong Huang, Linjun Yang, Rangan Majumder, Furu Wei
Learning to Generate Answers with Citations via Factual Consistency Models	Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate, impeding their reliability in mission-critical situations. One approach to address this issue is to provide citations to relevant sources alongside generated content, enhancing the verifiability of generations. However, citing passages accurately in answers remains a substantial challenge. This paper proposes a weakly-supervised fine-tuning method leveraging factual consistency models (FCMs). Our approach alternates between generating texts with citations and supervised fine-tuning with FCM-filtered citation data. Focused learning is integrated into the objective, directing the fine-tuning process to emphasise the factual unit tokens, as measured by an FCM. Results on the ALCE few-shot citation benchmark with various instruction-tuned LLMs demonstrate superior performance compared to in-context learning, vanilla supervised fine-tuning, and state-of-the-art methods, with an average improvement of 34.1, 15.5, and 10.5 citation F 1 points, respectively. Moreover, in a domain transfer setting we show that the obtained citation generation ability robustly transfers to unseen datasets. Notably, our citation improvements contribute to the lowest factual error rate across baselines.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.641	Rami Aly, Zhiqiang Tang, Samson Tan, George Karypis
Self-Training with Pseudo-Label Scorer for Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction	Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction (ASQP) aims to predict all quads (aspect term, aspect category, opinion term, sentiment polarity) for a given review, which is the most representative and challenging task in aspect-based sentiment analysis. A key challenge in the ASQP task is the scarcity of labeled data, which limits the performance of existing methods. To tackle this issue, we propose a self-training framework with a pseudo-label scorer, wherein a scorer assesses the match between reviews and their pseudo-labels, aiming to filter out mismatches and thereby enhance the effectiveness of self-training. We highlight two critical aspects to ensure the scorer's effectiveness and reliability: the quality of the training dataset and its model architecture. To this end, we create a human-annotated comparison dataset and train a generative model on it using ranking-based objectives. Extensive experiments on public ASQP datasets reveal that using our scorer can greatly and consistently improve the effectiveness of self-training. Moreover, we explore the possibility of replacing humans with large language models for comparison dataset annotation, and experiments demonstrate its feasibility. We will release our code and data via GitHub.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.640	Yice Zhang, Jie Zeng, Weiming Hu, Ziyi Wang, Shiwei Chen, Ruifeng Xu
Generative Cross-Modal Retrieval: Memorizing Images in Multimodal Language Models for Retrieval and Beyond	"The recent advancements in generative language models have demonstrated their ability to memorize knowledge from documents and recall knowledge to respond to user queries effectively. Building upon this capability, we propose to enable multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to memorize and recall images within their parameters. Given a user query for visual content, the MLLM is anticipated to ""recall"" the relevant image from its parameters as the response. Achieving this target presents notable challenges, including inbuilt visual memory and visual recall schemes within MLLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce a generative cross-modal retrieval framework, which assigns unique identifier strings to represent images and involves two training steps: learning to memorize and learning to retrieve. The first step focuses on training the MLLM to memorize the association between images and their respective identifiers. The latter step teaches the MLLM to generate the corresponding identifier of the target image, given the textual query input. By memorizing images in MLLMs, we introduce a new paradigm to cross-modal retrieval, distinct from previous discriminative approaches. The experiments demonstrate that the generative paradigm performs effectively and efficiently even with large-scale image candidate sets."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.639	Yongqi Li, Wenjie Wang, Leigang Qu, Liqiang Nie, Wenjie Li, Tat-Seng Chua
CharacterEval: A Chinese Benchmark for Role-Playing Conversational Agent Evaluation	Recently, the advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized generative agents. Among them, Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs) attract considerable attention due to their ability to emotionally engage users. However, the absence of a comprehensive benchmark impedes progress in this field. To bridge this gap, we introduce CharacterEval, a Chinese benchmark for comprehensive RPCA assessment, complemented by a tailored high-quality dataset. The dataset comprises 1,785 multi-turn role-playing dialogues, encompassing 11,376 examples and featuring 77 characters derived from Chinese novels and scripts. It was carefully constructed, beginning with initial dialogue extraction via GPT-4, followed by rigorous human-led quality control, and enhanced with in-depth character profiles sourced from Baidu Baike. CharacterEval employs a multifaceted evaluation approach, encompassing thirteen targeted metrics on four dimensions. To facilitate the convenient evaluation for these subjective metrics in CharacterEval, we further developed CharacterRM, a role-playing reward model based on human annotations, which has a higher correlation with human judgment compared to GPT-4. Comprehensive experiments on CharacterEval demonstrate that Chinese LLMs exhibit more promising capabilities than GPT-4 in Chinese role-playing conversation.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.638	Quan Tu, Shilong Fan, Zihang Tian, Tianhao Shen, Shuo Shang, Xin Gao, Rui Yan
Can Large Language Models Interpret Noun-Noun Compounds? A Linguistically-Motivated Study on Lexicalized and Novel Compounds	"Noun-noun compounds interpretation is the task where a model is given one of such constructions, and it is asked to provide a paraphrase, making the semantic relation between the nouns explicit, as in carrot cake is ""a cake made of carrots."" Such a task requires the ability to understand the implicit structured representation of the compound meaning. In this paper, we test to what extent the recent Large Language Models can interpret the semantic relation between the constituents of lexicalized English compounds and whether they can abstract from such semantic knowledge to predict the semantic relation between the constituents of similar but novel compounds by relying on analogical comparisons (e.g., carrot dessert). We test both Surprisal metrics and prompt-based methods to see whether i.) they can correctly predict the relation between constituents, and ii.) the semantic representation of the relation is robust to paraphrasing. Using a dataset of lexicalized and annotated noun-noun compounds, we find that LLMs can infer some semantic relations better than others (with a preference for compounds involving concrete concepts). When challenged to perform abstractions and transfer their interpretations to semantically similar but novel compounds, LLMs show serious limitations."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.637	Giulia Rambelli, Emmanuele Chersoni, Claudia Collacciani, Marianna Bolognesi
Quantifying Generalizations: Exploring the Divide Between Human and LLMs’ Sensitivity to Quantification	"Generics are expressions used to communicate abstractions about categories. While conveying general truths (e.g., ""Birds fly""), generics have the interesting property to admit exceptions (e.g., penguins do not fly). Statements of this type help us organizing our knowledge of the world, and form the basis of how we express it (Hampton, 2012; Leslie, 2014).This study investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) interpret generics, drawing upon psycholinguistic experimental methodologies. Understanding how LLMs interpret generic statements serves not only as a measure of their ability to abstract but also arguably plays a role in their encoding of stereotypes. Given that generics interpretation necessitates a comparison with explicitly quantified sentences, we explored i.) whether LLMs can correctly associate a quantifier with the generic structure, and ii.) whether the presence of a generic sentence as context influences the outcomes of quantifiers. We evaluated LLMs using both Surprisal distributions and prompting techniques.The findings indicate that models do not exhibit a strong sensitivity to quantification. Nevertheless, they seem to encode a meaning linked with the generic structure, which leads them to adjust their answers accordingly when a generalization is provided as context."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.636	Claudia Collacciani, Giulia Rambelli, Marianna Bolognesi
More frequent verbs are associated with more diverse valency frames: Efficient principles at the lexicon-grammar interface	A substantial body of work has provided evidence that the lexicons of natural languages are organized to support efficient communication. However, existing work has largely focused on word-internal properties, such as Zipf's observation that more frequent words are optimized in form to minimize communicative cost. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that efficient lexicon organization is also reflected in valency, or the combinations and orders of additional words and phrases a verb selects for in a sentence. We consider two measures of valency diversity for verbs: valency frame count (VFC), the number of distinct frames associated with a verb, and valency frame entropy (VFE), the average information content of frame selection associated with a verb. Using data from 79 languages, we provide evidence that more frequent verbs are associated with a greater diversity of valency frames, suggesting that the organization of valency is consistent with communicative efficiency principles. We discuss our findings in relation to classical findings such as Zipf's meaning-frequency law and the principle of least effort, as well as implications for theories of valency and communicative efficiency principles.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.635	Siyu Tao, Lucia Donatelli, Michael Hahn
Integrate the Essence and Eliminate the Dross: Fine-Grained Self-Consistency for Free-Form Language Generation	Self-consistency (SC), leveraging multiple samples from LLMs, shows significant gains on various reasoning tasks but struggles with free-form generation due to the difficulty of aggregating answers. Its variants, UCS and USC, rely on sample selection or voting mechanisms to improve output quality. These methods, however, face limitations due to their inability to fully utilize the nuanced consensus knowledge present within multiple candidate samples, often resulting in suboptimal outputs. We propose Fine-Grained Self-Consistency (FSC) to addresses these limitations by extracting and integrating segment-level commonalities from candidate samples, enhancing the performance of LLMs both in open-ended and reasoning tasks. Based on this, we present two additional strategies: candidate filtering, which enhances overall quality by identifying highly similar candidate sets, and merging, which reduces input token requirements by combining similar samples. The effectiveness of FSC is demonstrated through extensive experiments on various tasks, including summarization, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, using GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4. The results indicate significant improvements over baseline methods, showcasing the potential of FSC to optimize output quality by effectively synthesizing fine-grained consensus knowledge from multiple samples.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.634	Xinglin Wang, Yiwei Li, Shaoxiong Feng, Peiwen Yuan, Boyuan Pan, Heda Wang, Yao Hu, Kan Li
Less is More: Mitigating Multimodal Hallucination from an EOS Decision Perspective	Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often suffer from multimodal hallucinations, wherein they may create content that is not present in the visual inputs. In this paper, we explore a new angle of this issue: overly detailed training data hinders the model's ability to timely terminate generation, leading to continued outputs beyond visual perception limits. By investigating how the model decides to terminate generation with EOS, the special end-of-sentence token, we find that the model assesses the completeness of the entire sequence by comparing the generated text with the image. This observation suggests that the model possesses an inherent potential of making proper EOS decisions based on its visual perception to avoid overly lengthy outputs. To take advantage of such potential, we explore two methods to mitigate multimodal hallucinations: a training objective that enables the model to reduce hallucinations by learning from regular instruction data, and a data filtering strategy to prevent harmful training data from exacerbating model hallucinations. Both methods significantly improve the hallucination performance of LMMs, without requiring any additional data or knowledge.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.633	Zihao Yue, Liang Zhang, Qin Jin
How to Engage your Readers? Generating Guiding Questions to Promote Active Reading	Using questions in written text is an effective strategy to enhance readability. However, what makes an active reading question good, what the linguistic role of these questions is, and what is their impact on human reading remains understudied. We introduce GuidingQ, a dataset of 10K in-text questions from textbooks and scientific articles. By analyzing the dataset, we present a comprehensive understanding of the use, distribution, and linguistic characteristics of these questions. Then, we explore various approaches to generate such questions using language models. Our results highlight the importance of capturing inter-question relationships and the challenge of question position identification in generating these questions. Finally, we conduct a human study to understand the implication of such questions on reading comprehension. We find that the generated questions are of high quality and are almost as effective as human-written questions in terms of improving readers' memorization and comprehension.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.632	Peng Cui, Vilém Zouhar, Xiaoyu Zhang, Mrinmaya Sachan
Enhancing Explainable Rating Prediction through Annotated Macro Concepts	Generating recommendation reasons for recommendation results is a long-standing problem because it is challenging to explain the underlying reasons for recommending an item based on user and item IDs. Existing models usually learn semantic embeddings for each user and item, and generate the reasons according to the embeddings of the user-item pair. However, user and item IDs do not carry inherent semantic meaning, thus the limited number of reviews cannot model users' preferences and item characteristics effectively, negatively affecting the model generalization for unseen user-item pairs.To tackle the problem, we propose the Concept Enhanced Explainable Recommendation framework (CEER), which utilizes macro concepts as the intermediary to bridge the gap between the user/item embeddings and the recommendation reasons. Specifically, we maximize the information bottleneck to extract macro concepts from user-item reviews. Then, for recommended user-item pairs, we jointly train the concept embeddings with the user and item embeddings, and generate the explanation according to the concepts. Extensive experiments on three datasets verify the superiority of our CEER model.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.631	Huachi Zhou, Shuang Zhou, Hao Chen, Ninghao Liu, Fan Yang, Xiao Huang
An Entropy-based Text Watermarking Detection Method	Text watermarking algorithms for large language models (LLMs) can effectively identify machine-generated texts by embedding and detecting hidden features in the text. Although the current text watermarking algorithms perform well in most high-entropy scenarios, its performance in low-entropy scenarios still needs to be improved. In this work, we opine that the influence of token entropy should be fully considered in the watermark detection process, i.e. , the weight of each token during watermark detection should be customized according to its entropy, rather than setting the weights of all tokens to the same value as in previous methods. Specifically, we propose Entropy-based Text Watermarking Detection (EWD) that gives higher-entropy tokens higher influence weights during watermark detection, so as to better reflect the degree of watermarking. Furthermore, the proposed detection process is training-free and fully automated. From the experiments, we demonstrate that our EWD can achieve better detection performance in low-entropy scenarios, and our method is also general and can be applied to texts with different entropy distributions. Our code and data is available. Additionally, our algorithm could be accessed through MarkLLM (CITATION).	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.630	Yijian Lu, Aiwei Liu, Dianzhi Yu, Jingjing Li, Irwin King
Learning Task Decomposition to Assist Humans in Competitive Programming	When using language models (LMs) to solve complex problems, humans might struggle to understand the LM-generated solutions and repair the flawed ones. To assist humans in repairing them, we propose to automatically decompose complex solutions into multiple simpler pieces that correspond to specific subtasks. We introduce a novel objective for learning task decomposition, termed assistive value (AssistV), which measures the feasibility and speed for humans to repair the decomposed solution. We collect a dataset of human repair experiences on different decomposed solutions. Utilizing the collected data as in-context examples, we then learn to critique, refine, and rank decomposed solutions to improve AssistV. We validate our method under competitive programming problems: under 177 hours of human study, our method enables non-experts to solve 33.3% more problems, speeds them up by 3.3x, and empowers them to match unassisted experts.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.629	Jiaxin Wen, Ruiqi Zhong, Pei Ke, Zhihong Shao, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang
Argument Mining in Data Scarce Settings: Cross-lingual Transfer and Few-shot Techniques	Recent research on sequence labelling has been exploring different strategies to mitigate the lack of manually annotated data for the large majority of the world languages. Among others, the most successful approaches have been based on (i) the crosslingual transfer capabilities of multilingual pre-trained language models (model-transfer), (ii) data translation and label projection (data-transfer) and (iii), prompt-based learning by reusing the mask objective to exploit the few-shot capabilities of pre-trained language models (few-shot). Previous work seems to conclude that model-transfer outperform data-transfer methods and that few-shot techniques based on prompting are superior to updating the model's weights via fine-tuning. In this paper we empirically demonstrate that, for Argument Mining, a sequence labelling task which requires the detection of long and complex discourse structures, previous insights on crosslingual transfer or few-shot learning do not apply. Contrary to previous work, we show that for Argument Mining data-transfer obtains better results than model-transfer and that fine-tuning outperforms few-shot methods. Regarding the former, the domain of the dataset used for data-transfer seems to be a deciding factor, while, for few-shot, the type of task (length and complexity of the sequence spans) and sampling method proves to be crucial.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.628	Anar Yeginbergen, Maite Oronoz, Rodrigo Agerri
Cross-Lingual Knowledge Editing in Large Language Models	Knowledge editing aims to change language models' performance on several special cases (i.e., editing scope) by infusing the corresponding expected knowledge into them. With the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), knowledge editing has been shown as a promising technique to adapt LLMs to new knowledge without retraining from scratch. However, most of the previous studies neglect the multi-lingual nature of some main-stream LLMs (e.g., LLaMA, ChatGPT and GPT-4), and typically focus on monolingual scenarios, where LLMs are edited and evaluated in the same language. As a result, it is still unknown the effect of source language editing on a different target language. In this paper, we aim to figure out this cross-lingual effect in knowledge editing. Specifically, we first collect a large-scale cross-lingual synthetic dataset by translating ZsRE from English to Chinese. Then, we conduct English editing on various knowledge editing methods covering different paradigms, and evaluate their performance in Chinese, and vice versa. To give deeper analyses of the cross-lingual effect, the evaluation includes four aspects, i.e., reliability, generality, locality and portability. Furthermore, we analyze the inconsistent behaviors of the edited models and discuss their specific challenges.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.627	Jiaan Wang, Yunlong Liang, Zengkui Sun, Yuxuan Cao, Jiarong Xu, Fandong Meng
DoRA: Enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Dynamic Rank Distribution	Fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models is inherently a resource-intensive task. While it can enhance the capabilities of the model, it also incurs substantial computational costs, posing challenges to the practical application of downstream tasks. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) rely on a bypass framework that ignores the differential parameter budget requirements across weight matrices, which may lead to suboptimal fine-tuning outcomes. To address this issue, we introduce the Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) method. DoRA decomposes high-rank LoRA layers into structured single-rank components, allowing for dynamic pruning of parameter budget based on their importance to specific tasks during training, which makes the most of the limited parameter budget. Experimental results demonstrate that DoRA can achieve competitive performance compared with LoRA and full model fine-tuning, and outperform various strong baselines with the same storage parameter budget.

SAPT: A Shared Attention Framework for Parameter-Efficient Continual Learning of Large Language Models	The continual learning (CL) ability is vital for deploying large language models (LLMs) in the dynamic world. Existing methods devise the learning module to acquire task-specific knowledge with parameter-efficient tuning (PET) block and the selection module to pick out the corresponding one for the testing input, aiming at handling the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and knowledge transfer in CL. However, these methods tend to address only one of the challenges, ignoring the potential of aligning the two modules to effectively address catastrophic forgetting and knowledge transfer simultaneously. To this end, we propose a novel Shared Attention Framework (SAPT), to align the PET learning and selection via the Shared Attentive Learning & Selection module. Extensive Experiments on two CL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SAPT. Moreover, SAPT consistently demonstrates its superiority when we scale it to different model sizes (from 770M to 13B), different model architectures (T5 and LLaMA-2) and unseen tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.625	Weixiang Zhao, Shilong Wang, Yulin Hu, Yanyan Zhao, Bing Qin, Xuanyu Zhang, Qing Yang, Dongliang Xu, Wanxiang Che
AlignBench: Benchmarking Chinese Alignment of Large Language Models	"Alignment has become a critical step for instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to become helpful assistants. However, effective evaluation of alignment for emerging Chinese LLMs is still significantly lacking, calling for real-scenario grounded, open-ended, challenging and automatic evaluations tailored for alignment. To fill in this gap, we introduce AlignBench, a comprehensive multi-dimensional benchmark for evaluating LLMs' alignment in Chinese. We tailor a human-in-the-loop data curation pipeline, containing 8 main categories, 683 real-scenario rooted queries and corresponding human verified references.To ensure references' correctness, each knowledge-intensive query is accompanied with evidences collected from reliable webpages (including the url and quotation) by our annotators.For automatic evaluation, our benchmark employs a rule-calibrated multi-dimensional LLM-as-Judge (CITATION) with Chain-of-Thought to generate explanations and final ratings as evaluations, ensuring high reliability and interpretability.All evaluation codes and data are publicly available at <a href=""https://github.com/THUDM/AlignBench"" class=""acl-markup-url"">https://github.com/THUDM/AlignBench"	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.624	Xiao Liu, Xuanyu Lei, Shengyuan Wang, Yue Huang, Andrew Feng, Bosi Wen, Jiale Cheng, Pei Ke, Yifan Xu, Weng Lam Tam, Xiaohan Zhang, Lichao Sun, Xiaotao Gu, Hongning Wang, Jing Zhang, Minlie Huang, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang
ChunkAttention: Efficient Self-Attention with Prefix-Aware KV Cache and Two-Phase Partition	Self-attention is an essential component of large language models (LLM) but a significant source of inference latency for long sequences. In multi-tenant LLMs serving scenarios, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention can be optimized by using the probability that multiple LLM requests have shared system prompts in prefixes. In this paper, we introduce ChunkAttention, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache. This is achieved by breaking monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into the auxiliary prefix tree. Consequently, on top of the prefix-tree based KV cache, we design an efficient self-attention kernel, where a two-phase partition algorithm is implemented to improve the data locality during self-attention computation in the presence of shared system prompts. Experiments show that ChunkAttention can speed up the self-attention kernel by 3.2-4.8 × compared to the start-of-the-art implementation, with the length of the system prompt ranging from 1024 to 4096.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.623	Lu Ye, Ze Tao, Yong Huang, Yang Li
Split and Rephrase with Large Language Models	The Split and Rephrase (SPRP) task, which consists in splitting complex sentences into a sequence of shorter grammatical sentences, while preserving the original meaning, can facilitate the processing of complex texts for humans and machines alike. It is also a valuable testbed to evaluate natural language processing models, as it requires modelling complex grammatical aspects. In this work, we evaluate large language models on the task, showing that they can provide large improvements over the state of the art on the main metrics, although still lagging in terms of splitting compliance. Results from two human evaluations further support the conclusions drawn from automated metric results. We provide a comprehensive study that includes prompting variants, domain shift, fine-tuned pretrained language models of varying parameter size and training data volumes, contrasted with both zero-shot and few-shot approaches on instruction-tuned language models. Although the latter were markedly outperformed by fine-tuned models, they may constitute a reasonable off-the-shelf alternative. Our results provide a fine-grained analysis of the potential and limitations of large language models for SPRP, with significant improvements achievable using relatively small amounts of training data and model parameters overall, and remaining limitations for all models on the task.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.622	Antonio David Ponce Martínez, Thierry Etchegoyhen, Jesus Javier Calleja Perez, Harritxu Gete
Language Models can Exploit Cross-Task In-context Learning for Data-Scarce Novel Tasks	Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed NLP with their remarkable In-context Learning (ICL) capabilities. Automated assistants based on LLMs are gaining popularity; however, adapting them to novel tasks is still challenging. While colossal models excel in zero-shot performance, their computational demands limit widespread use, and smaller language models struggle without context. This paper investigates whether LLMs can generalize from labeled examples of predefined tasks to novel tasks. Drawing inspiration from biological neurons and the mechanistic interpretation of the Transformer architecture, we explore the potential for information sharing across tasks. We design a cross-task prompting setup with three LLMs and show that LLMs achieve significant performance improvements despite no examples from the target task in the context. Cross-task prompting leads to a remarkable performance boost of 107% for LLaMA-2 7B, 18.6% for LLaMA-2 13B, and 3.2% for GPT 3.5 on average over zero-shot prompting, and performs comparable to standard in-context learning. The effectiveness of generating pseudo-labels for in-task examples is demonstrated, and our analyses reveal a strong correlation between the effect of cross-task examples and model activation similarities in source and target input tokens. This paper offers a first-of-its-kind exploration of LLMs' ability to solve novel tasks based on contextual signals from different task examples.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.621	Anwoy Chatterjee, Eshaan Tanwar, Subhabrata Dutta, Tanmoy Chakraborty
Aya Dataset: An Open-Access Collection for Multilingual Instruction Tuning	Datasets are foundational to many breakthroughs in modern artificial intelligence. Many recent achievements in the space of natural language processing (NLP) can be attributed to the fine-tuning of pre-trained models on a diverse set of tasks that enables a large language model (LLM) to respond to instructions. Instruction fine-tuning (IFT) requires specifically constructed and annotated datasets. However, existing datasets are almost all in the English language. In this work, our primary goal is to bridge the language gap by building a human-curated instruction-following dataset spanning 65 languages. We worked with fluent speakers of languages from around the world to collect natural instances of instructions and completions. Furthermore, we create the most extensive multilingual collection to date, comprising 513 million instances through templating and augmenting existing datasets across 114 languages. In total, we contribute three key resources: we develop and open-source the Aya Dataset, the Aya Collection, and the Aya Evaluation Suite. The Aya initiative also serves as a valuable case study in participatory research, involving collaborators from 119 countries. We see this as an important framework for future research collaborations that aim to bridge gaps in resources.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.620	Shivalika Singh, Freddie Vargus, Daniel D’souza, Börje Karlsson, Abinaya Mahendiran, Wei-Yin Ko, Herumb Shandilya, Jay Patel, Deividas Mataciunas, Laura O’Mahony, Mike Zhang, Ramith Hettiarachchi, Joseph Wilson, Marina Machado, Luisa Moura, Dominik Krzemiński, Hakimeh Fadaei, Irem Ergun, Ifeoma Okoh, Aisha Alaagib, Oshan Mudannayake, Zaid Alyafeai, Vu Chien, Sebastian Ruder, Surya Guthikonda, Emad Alghamdi, Sebastian Gehrmann, Niklas Muennighoff, Max Bartolo, Julia Kreutzer, Ahmet Üstün, Marzieh Fadaee, Sara Hooker
JumpCoder: Go Beyond Autoregressive Coder via Online Modification	While existing code large language models (code LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities in code generation, their autoregressive sequential generation inherently lacks reversibility. This limitation hinders them from timely correcting previous missing statements during coding as humans do, often leading to error propagation and suboptimal performance. We introduce JumpCoder, a novel model-agnostic framework that enables human-like online modification and non-sequential generation to augment code LLMs. The key idea behind JumpCoder is to insert new code into the currently generated code when necessary during generation, which is achieved through an auxiliary infilling model that works in tandem with the code LLM. Since identifying the best infill position beforehand is intractable, we adopt an infill-first, judge-later strategy, which experiments with filling at the k most critical positions following the generation of each line, and uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser alongside the Generation Model Scoring to effectively judge the validity of each potential infill. Extensive experiments using six state-of-the-art code LLMs across multiple and multilingual benchmarks consistently indicate significant improvements over all baselines. Our code is available in the uploaded attachment.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.619	Mouxiang Chen, Hao Tian, Zhongxin Liu, Xiaoxue Ren, Jianling Sun
IL-TUR: Benchmark for Indian Legal Text Understanding and Reasoning	Legal systems worldwide are inundated with exponential growth in cases and documents. There is an imminent need to develop NLP and ML techniques for automatically processing and understanding legal documents to streamline the legal system. However, evaluating and comparing various NLP models designed specifically for the legal domain is challenging. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing : Benchmark for Indian Legal Text Understanding and Reasoning. contains monolingual (English, Hindi) and multi-lingual (9 Indian languages) domain-specific tasks that address different aspects of the legal system from the point of view of understanding and reasoning over Indian legal documents. We present baseline models (including LLM-based) for each task, outlining the gap between models and the ground truth. To foster further research in the legal domain, we create a leaderboard (available at: https://exploration-lab.github.io/IL-TUR/ ) where the research community can upload and compare legal text understanding systems.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.618	Abhinav Joshi, Shounak Paul, Akshat Sharma, Pawan Goyal, Saptarshi Ghosh, Ashutosh Modi
Aligning Large Language Models by On-Policy Self-Judgment	Existing approaches for aligning large language models with human preferences face a trade-off that requires a separate reward model (RM) for on-policy learning. In this paper, we present a novel alignment framework, SELF-JUDGE that (1) does on-policy learning and 2) is parameter efficient, as it does not require an additional RM for evaluating the samples for on-policy learning. To this end, we propose Judge-augmented Supervised Fine-Tuning (JSFT) to train a single model to act as both a policy and a judge. Specifically, we view the pairwise judgment task, choosing the better response from a response pair, as a special case of the instruction-following task. The resulting model can judge preferences of on-the-fly responses from current policy initialized from itself. Experimental results show the efficacy of SELF-JUDGE, outperforming baselines in preference benchmarks. We also show that the rejecting sampling by itself can improve performance further without an additional evaluator.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.617	Sangkyu Lee, Sungdong Kim, Ashkan Yousefpour, Minjoon Seo, Kang Min Yoo, Youngjae Yu
Exploring Precision and Recall to assess the quality and diversity of LLMs	We introduce a novel evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama-2 and Mistral, focusing on importing Precision and Recall metrics from image generation to text generation. This approach allows for a nuanced assessment of the quality and diversity of generated text without the need for aligned corpora. By conducting a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art language models, the study reveals new insights into their performance on open-ended generation tasks, which are not adequately captured by traditional benchmarks. The findings highlight a trade-off between the quality and diversity of generated samples, particularly when models are fine-tuned on instruction dataset or with human feedback. This work extends the toolkit for distribution-based NLP evaluation, offering insights into the practical capabilities and challenges that current LLMs face in generating diverse and high-quality text.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.616	Florian Le Bronnec, Alexandre Verine, Benjamin Negrevergne, Yann Chevaleyre, Alexandre Allauzen
Learning to Plan and Generate Text with Citations	The increasing demand for the deployment of LLMs in information-seeking scenarios has spurred efforts in creating verifiable systems, which generate responses to queries along with supporting evidence. In this paper, we explore the attribution capabilities of plan-based models which have been recently shown to improve the faithfulness, grounding, and controllability of generated text. We conceptualize plans as a sequence of questions which serve as blueprints of the generated content and its organization. We propose two attribution models that utilize different variants of blueprints, an abstractive model where questions are generated from scratch, and an extractive model where questions are copied from the input. Experiments on long-form question-answering show that planning consistently improves attribution quality. Moreover, the citations generated by blueprint models are more accurate compared to those obtained from LLM-based pipelines lacking a planning component.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.615	Constanza Fierro, Reinald Kim Amplayo, Fantine Huot, Nicola De Cao, Joshua Maynez, Shashi Narayan, Mirella Lapata
An Expert is Worth One Token: Synergizing Multiple Expert LLMs as Generalist via Expert Token Routing	We present Expert-Token-Routing, a unified generalist framework that facilitates seamless integration of multiple expert LLMs. Our framework represents expert LLMs as special expert tokens within the vocabulary of a meta LLM. The meta LLM can route to an expert LLM like generating new tokens. Expert-Token-Routing not only supports learning the implicit expertise of expert LLMs from existing instruction dataset but also allows for dynamic extension of new expert LLMs in a plug-and-play manner. It also conceals the detailed collaboration process from the user's perspective, facilitating interaction as though it were a singular LLM. Our framework outperforms various existing multi-LLM collaboration paradigms across benchmarks that incorporate six diverse expert domains, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness in building generalist LLM system via synergizing multiple expert LLMs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.614	Ziwei Chai, Guoyin Wang, Jing Su, Tianjie Zhang, Xuanwen Huang, Xuwu Wang, Jingjing Xu, Jianbo Yuan, Hongxia Yang, Fei Wu, Yang Yang
Complex Reasoning over Logical Queries on Commonsense Knowledge Graphs	Event commonsense reasoning requires the ability to reason about the relationship between events, as well as infer implicit contextunderlying that relationship. However, data scarcity makes it challenging for language models to learn to generate commonsense infer-ences for contexts and questions involving interactions between complex events. To address this demand, we present COM2 (COMplexCOMmonsense), a new dataset created by sampling multi-hop logical queries (e.g., the joint effect or cause of both event A and B, or theeffect of the effect of event C) from an existing commonsense knowledge graph (CSKG), and verbalizing them using handcrafted rules andlarge language models into multiple-choice and text generation questions. Our experiments show that language models trained on COM2 exhibit significant improve ments in complex reasoning ability, resulting in enhanced zero-shot performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks for question answering and generative commonsense reasoning, without expensive human annotations	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.613	Tianqing Fang, Zeming Chen, Yangqiu Song, Antoine Bosselut
Improving Conversational Abilities of Quantized Large Language Models via Direct Preference Alignment	The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has facilitated their transformation into conversational chatbots that can grasp contextual nuances and generate pertinent sentences, closely mirroring human values through advanced techniques such as instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, the computational efficiency required for LLMs, achieved through techniques like post-training quantization (PTQ), presents challenges such as token-flipping that can impair chatbot performance. In response, we propose a novel preference alignment approach, quantization-aware direct preference optimization (QDPO), that aligns quantized LLMs with their full-precision counterparts, improving conversational abilities. Evaluated on two instruction-tuned LLMs in various languages, QDPO demonstrated superior performance in improving conversational abilities compared to established PTQ and knowledge-distillation fine-tuning techniques, marking a significant step forward in the development of efficient and effective conversational LLMs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.612	Janghwan Lee, Seongmin Park, Sukjin Hong, Minsoo Kim, Du-Seong Chang, Jungwook Choi
Self-chats from Large Language Models Make Small Emotional Support Chatbot Better	"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong generalization abilities to excel in various tasks, including emotion support conversations. However, deploying such LLMs like GPT-3 (175B parameters) is resource-intensive and challenging at scale. In this study, we utilize LLMs as ""Counseling Teacher"" to enhance smaller models' emotion support response abilities, significantly reducing the necessity of scaling up model size. To this end, we first introduce an iterative expansion framework, aiming to prompt the large teacher model to curate an expansive emotion support dialogue dataset. This curated dataset, termed ExTES, encompasses a broad spectrum of scenarios and is crafted with meticulous strategies to ensure its quality and comprehensiveness. Based on this, we then devise a Diverse Response Inpainting (DRI) mechanism to harness the teacher model to produce multiple diverse responses by filling in the masked conversation context. This richness and variety serve as instructive examples, providing a robust foundation for fine-tuning smaller student models. Experiments across varied scenarios reveal that the teacher-student scheme with DRI notably improves the response abilities of smaller models, even outperforming the teacher model in some cases. The dataset and codes are available in https://github.com/pandazzh2020/ExTES."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.611	Zhonghua Zheng, Lizi Liao, Yang Deng, Libo Qin, Liqiang Nie
MIST: Mutual Information Maximization for Short Text Clustering	Short text clustering poses substantial challenges due to the limited amount of information provided by each text sample. Previous efforts based on dense representations are still inadequate as texts are not sufficiently segregated in the embedding space before clustering. Even though the state-of-the-art method utilizes contrastive learning to boost performance, the process of summarizing all local tokens to form a sequence representation for the whole text includes noise that may obscure limited key information. We propose Mutual Information Maximization Framework for Short Text Clustering (MIST), which overcomes the information drown-out by including a mechanism to maximize the mutual information between representations on both sequence and token levels. Experimental results across eight standard short text datasets show that MIST outperforms the state-of-the-art method in terms of Accuracy or Normalized Mutual Information in most cases.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.610	Krissanee Kamthawee, Can Udomcharoenchaikit, Sarana Nutanong
Measuring Meaning Composition in the Human Brain with Composition Scores from Large Language Models	The process of meaning composition, wherein smaller units like morphemes or words combine to form the meaning of phrases and sentences, is essential for human sentence comprehension. Despite extensive neurolinguistic research into the brain regions involved in meaning composition, a computational metric to quantify the extent of composition is still lacking. Drawing on the key-value memory interpretation of transformer feed-forward network blocks, we introduce the Composition Score, a novel model-based metric designed to quantify the degree of meaning composition during sentence comprehension. Experimental findings show that this metric correlates with brain clusters associated with word frequency, structural processing, and general sensitivity to words, suggesting the multifaceted nature of meaning composition during human sentence comprehension.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.609	Changjiang Gao, Jixing Li, Jiajun Chen, Shujian Huang
Soul-Mix: Enhancing Multimodal Machine Translation with Manifold Mixup	Multimodal machine translation (MMT) aims to improve the performance of machine translation with the help of visual information, which has received widespread attention recently. It has been verified that visual information brings greater performance gains when the textual information is limited. However, most previous works ignore to take advantage of the complete textual inputs and the limited textual inputs at the same time, which limits the overall performance. To solve this issue, we propose a mixup method termed Soul-Mix to enhance MMT by using visual information more effectively. We mix the predicted translations of complete textual input and the limited textual inputs. Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of three translation directions show that our Soul-Mix significantly outperforms existing approaches and achieves new state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters than some previous models. Besides, the strength of Soul-Mix is more obvious on more challenging MSCOCO dataset which includes more out-of-domain instances with lots of ambiguous verbs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.608	Xuxin Cheng, Ziyu Yao, Yifei Xin, Hao An, Hongxiang Li, Yaowei Li, Yuexian Zou
Draft& Verify: Lossless Large Language Model Acceleration via Self-Speculative Decoding	We present a novel inference scheme, self-speculative decoding, for accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for an auxiliary model. This approach is characterized by a two-stage process: drafting and verification. The drafting stage generates draft tokens at a slightly lower quality but more quickly, which is achieved by selectively skipping certain intermediate layers during drafting. Subsequently, the verification stage employs the original LLM to validate those draft output tokens in one forward pass. This process ensures the final output remains identical to that produced by the unaltered LLM. Moreover, the proposed method requires no additional neural network training and no extra memory footprint, making it a plug-and-play and cost-effective solution for inference acceleration. Benchmarks with LLaMA-2 and its variants demonstrated a speedup up to 1.99 × .	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.607	Jun Zhang, Jue Wang, Huan Li, Lidan Shou, Ke Chen, Gang Chen, Sharad Mehrotra
Model Composition for Multimodal Large Language Models	Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown rapid progress, moving towards the goal of creating versatile MLLMs that understand inputs from various modalities. However, existing methods typically rely on joint training with paired multimodal instruction data, which is resource-intensive and challenging to extend to new modalities. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm through the model composition of existing MLLMs to create a new model that retains the modal understanding capabilities of each original model. Our basic implementation, NaiveMC, demonstrates the effectiveness of this paradigm by reusing modality encoders and merging LLM parameters. Furthermore, we introduce DAMC to address parameter interference and mismatch issues during the merging process, thereby enhancing the model performance. To facilitate research in this area, we propose MCUB, a benchmark for assessing ability of MLLMs to understand inputs from diverse modalities. Experiments on this benchmark and four other multimodal understanding tasks show significant improvements over baselines, proving that model composition can create a versatile model capable of processing inputs from multiple modalities.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.606	Chi Chen, Yiyang Du, Zheng Fang, Ziyue Wang, Fuwen Luo, Peng Li, Ming Yan, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang, Maosong Sun, Yang Liu
Browse and Concentrate: Comprehending Multimodal Content via Prior-LLM Context Fusion	"With the bloom of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that incorporate LLMs with pre-trained vision models have recently demonstrated impressive performance across diverse vision-language tasks. However, they fall short to comprehend context involving multiple images. A primary reason for this shortcoming is that the visual features for each images are encoded individually by frozen encoders before feeding into the LLM backbone, lacking awareness of other images and the multimodal instructions. We term this issue as prior-LLM modality isolation and propose a two phase paradigm, browse-and-concentrate, to enable in-depth multimodal context fusion prior to feeding the features into LLMs. This paradigm initially ""browses"" through the inputs for essential insights, and then revisits the inputs to ""concentrate"" on crucial details, guided by these insights, to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the multimodal inputs. Additionally, we develop training strategies specifically to enhance the understanding of multi-image inputs. Our method markedly boosts the performance on 7 multi-image scenarios, contributing to increments on average accuracy by 2.13% and 7.60% against strong MLLMs baselines with 3B and 11B LLMs, respectively."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.605	Ziyue Wang, Chi Chen, Yiqi Zhu, Fuwen Luo, Peng Li, Ming Yan, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang, Maosong Sun, Yang Liu
Benchmarking Chinese Commonsense Reasoning of LLMs: From Chinese-Specifics to Reasoning-Memorization Correlations	We introduce CHARM, the first benchmark for comprehensively and in-depth evaluating the commonsense reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) in Chinese, which covers both globally known and Chinese-specific commonsense. We evaluated 7 English and 12 Chinese-oriented LLMs on CHARM, employing 5 representative prompt strategies for improving LLMs' reasoning ability, such as Chain-of-Thought. Our findings indicated that the LLM's language orientation and the task's domain influence the effectiveness of the prompt strategy, which enriches previous research findings. We built closely-interconnected reasoning and memorization tasks, and found that some LLMs struggle with memorizing Chinese commonsense, affecting their reasoning ability, while others show differences in reasoning despite similar memorization performance. We also evaluated the LLMs' memorization-independent reasoning abilities and analyzed the typical errors. Our study precisely identified the LLMs' strengths and weaknesses, providing the clear direction for optimization. It can also serve as a reference for studies in other fields. We will release CHARM at https://github.com/opendatalab/CHARM.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.604	Jiaxing Sun, Weiquan Huang, Jiang Wu, Chenya Gu, Wei Li, Songyang Zhang, Hang Yan, Conghui He
Enhancing Multilingual Capabilities of Large Language Models through Self-Distillation from Resource-Rich Languages	While large language models (LLMs) have been pre-trained on multilingual corpora, their performance still lags behind in most languages compared to a few resource-rich languages. One common approach to mitigate this issue is to translate training data from resource-rich languages into other languages and then continue training. However, using the data obtained solely relying on translation while ignoring the original capabilities of LLMs across languages is not always effective, which we show will limit the performance of cross-lingual knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose SDRRL, a method based on Self-Distillation from Resource-Rich Languages that effectively improve multilingual performance by leveraging the internal capabilities of LLMs on resource-rich languages. We evaluate on different LLMs (LLaMA-2 and SeaLLM) and source languages (English and French) across various comprehension and generation tasks, experimental results demonstrate that SDRRL can significantly enhance multilingual capabilities while minimizing the impact on original performance in resource-rich languages.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.603	Yuanchi Zhang, Yile Wang, Zijun Liu, Shuo Wang, Xiaolong Wang, Peng Li, Maosong Sun, Yang Liu
Layer-Condensed KV Cache for Efficient Inference of Large Language Models	Huge memory consumption has been a major bottleneck for deploying high-throughput large language models in real-world applications. In addition to the large number of parameters, the key-value (KV) cache for the attention mechanism in the transformer architecture consumes a significant amount of memory, especially when the number of layers is large for deep language models. In this paper, we propose a novel method that only computes and caches the KVs of a small number of layers, thus significantly saving memory consumption and improving inference throughput. Our experiments on large language models show that our method achieves up to 26 × higher throughput than standard transformers and competitive performance in language modeling and downstream tasks. In addition, our method is orthogonal to existing transformer memory-saving techniques, so it is straightforward to integrate them with our model, achieving further improvement in inference efficiency.

Fortify the Shortest Stave in Attention: Enhancing Context Awareness of Large Language Models for Effective Tool Use	In this paper, we demonstrate that an inherent waveform pattern in the attention allocation of large language models (LLMs) significantly affects their performance in tasks demanding a high degree of context awareness, such as utilizing LLMs for tool-use. Specifically, the crucial information in the context will be potentially overlooked by model when it is positioned in the trough zone of the attention waveform, leading to decreased performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel inference method named Attention Buckets. It allows LLMs to process their input through multiple parallel processes. Each process utilizes a distinct base angle for the rotary position embedding, thereby creating a unique attention waveform. By compensating an attention trough of a particular process with an attention peak of another process, our approach enhances LLM's awareness to various contextual positions, thus mitigating the risk of overlooking crucial information. In the largest tool-use benchmark, our method elevates a 7B model to achieve state-of-the-art performance, comparable to that of GPT-4. On other benchmarks and some RAG tasks, which also demand a thorough understanding of contextual content, Attention Buckets also exhibited notable enhancements in performance.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.601	Yuhan Chen, Ang Lv, Ting-En Lin, Changyu Chen, Yuchuan Wu, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li, Rui Yan
Measuring Political Bias in Large Language Models: What Is Said and How It Is Said	We propose to measure political bias in LLMs by analyzing both the content and style of their generated content regarding political issues. Existing benchmarks and measures focus on gender and racial biases. However, political bias exists in LLMs and can lead to polarization and other harms in downstream applications. In order to provide transparency to users, we advocate that there should be fine-grained and explainable measures of political biases generated by LLMs. Our proposed measure looks at different political issues such as reproductive rights and climate change, at both the content (the substance of the generation) and the style (the lexical polarity) of such bias. We measured the political bias in eleven open-sourced LLMs and showed that our proposed framework is easily scalable to other topics and is explainable.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.600	Yejin Bang, Delong Chen, Nayeon Lee, Pascale Fung
Fundamental Capabilities of Large Language Models and their Applications in Domain Scenarios: A Survey	Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant value in domain-specific applications, benefiting from their fundamental capabilities. Nevertheless, it is still unclear which fundamental capabilities contribute to success in specific domains. Moreover, the existing benchmark-based evaluation cannot effectively reflect the performance of real-world applications. In this survey, we review recent advances of LLMs in domain applications, aiming to summarize the fundamental capabilities and their collaboration. Furthermore, we establish connections between fundamental capabilities and specific domains, evaluating the varying importance of different capabilities. Based on our findings, we propose a reliable strategy for domains to choose more robust backbone LLMs for real-world applications.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.599	Jiawei Li, Yizhe Yang, Yu Bai, Xiaofeng Zhou, Yinghao Li, Huashan Sun, Yuhang Liu, Xingpeng Si, Yuhao Ye, Yixiao Wu, 林一冠 林一冠, Bin Xu, Ren Bowen, Chong Feng, Yang Gao, Heyan Huang
Interpretable User Satisfaction Estimation for Conversational Systems with Large Language Models	Accurate and interpretable user satisfaction estimation (USE) is critical for understanding, evaluating, and continuously improving conversational systems. Users express their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with diverse conversational patterns in both general-purpose (ChatGPT and Bing Copilot) and task-oriented (customer service chatbot) conversational systems. Existing approaches based on featurized ML models or text embeddings fall short in extracting generalizable patterns and are hard to interpret. In this work, we show that LLMs can extract interpretable signals of user satisfaction from their natural language utterances more effectively than embedding-based approaches. Moreover, an LLM can be tailored for USE via an iterative prompting framework using supervision from labeled examples. Our proposed method, Supervised Prompting for User satisfaction Rubrics (SPUR), not only has higher accuracy but is more interpretable as it scores user satisfaction via learned rubrics with a detailed breakdown.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.598	Ying-Chun Lin, Jennifer Neville, Jack Stokes, Longqi Yang, Tara Safavi, Mengting Wan, Scott Counts, Siddharth Suri, Reid Andersen, Xiaofeng Xu, Deepak Gupta, Sujay Kumar Jauhar, Xia Song, Georg Buscher, Saurabh Tiwary, Brent Hecht, Jaime Teevan
Uncertainty Aware Learning for Language Model Alignment	As instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) evolve, aligning pretrained foundation models presents increasing challenges. Existing alignment strategies, which typically leverage diverse and high-quality data sources, often overlook the intrinsic uncertainty of tasks, learning all data samples equally. This may lead to suboptimal data efficiency and model performance. In response, we propose uncertainty-aware learning (UAL) to improve the model alignment of different task scenarios, by introducing the sample uncertainty (elicited from more capable LLMs). We implement UAL by a simple fashion – adaptively setting the label smoothing value of training according to the uncertainty of individual samples. Analysis shows that our UAL indeed facilitates better token clustering in the feature space, validating our hypothesis. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our UAL significantly and consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning. Notably, LLMs aligned in a mixed scenario have achieved an average improvement of 10.62% on high-entropy tasks (i.e., AlpacaEval leaderboard), and 1.81% on complex low-entropy tasks (i.e., MetaMath and GSM8K).	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.597	Yikun Wang, Rui Zheng, Liang Ding, Qi Zhang, Dahua Lin, Dacheng Tao
Simple but Effective Compound Geometric Operations for Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion	Temporal knowledge graph completion aims to infer the missing facts in temporal knowledge graphs. Current approaches usually embed factual knowledge into continuous vector space and apply geometric operations to learn potential patterns in temporal knowledge graphs. However, these methods only adopt a single operation, which may have limitations in capturing the complex temporal dynamics present in temporal knowledge graphs. Therefore, we propose a simple but effective method, i.e. TCompoundE, which is specially designed with two geometric operations, including time-specific and relation-specific operations. We provide mathematical proofs to demonstrate the ability of TCompoundE to encode various relation patterns. Experimental results show that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing temporal knowledge graph embedding models. Our code is available at https://github.com/nk-ruiying/TCompoundE.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.596	Rui Ying, Mengting Hu, Jianfeng Wu, Yalan Xie, Xiaoyi Liu, Zhunheng Wang, Ming Jiang, Hang Gao, Linlin Zhang, Renhong Cheng
IndicGenBench: A Multilingual Benchmark to Evaluate Generation Capabilities of LLMs on Indic Languages	As large language models (LLMs) see increasing adoption across the globe, it is imperative for LLMs to be representative of the linguistic diversity of the world. India is a linguistically diverse country of 1.4 Billion people. To facilitate research on multilingual LLM evaluation, we release IndicGenBench — the largest benchmark for evaluating LLMs on user-facing generation tasks across a diverse set 29 of Indic languages covering 13 scripts and 4 language families. IndicGenBench is composed of diverse generation tasks like cross-lingual summarization, machine translation, and cross-lingual question answering. IndicGenBench extends existing benchmarks to many Indic languages through human curation providing multi-way parallel evaluation data for many under-represented Indic languages for the first time. We evaluate stateof-the-art LLMs like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM2, and LLaMA on IndicGenBench in a variety of settings. The largest PaLM-2 models performs the best on most tasks, however, there is a significant performance gap in all languages compared to English showing that further research is needed for the development of more inclusive multilingual language models.

Exploring Hybrid Question Answering via Program-based Prompting	Question answering over heterogeneous data requires reasoning over diverse sources of data, which is challenging due to the large scale of information and organic coupling of heterogeneous data. Various approaches have been proposed to address these challenges. One approach involves training specialized retrievers to select relevant information, thereby reducing the input length. Another approach is to transform diverse modalities of data into a single modality, simplifying the task difficulty and enabling more straightforward processing. In this paper, we propose HProPro, a novel program-based prompting framework for the hybrid question answering task. HProPro follows the code generation and execution paradigm. In addition, HProPro integrates various functions to tackle the hybrid reasoning scenario. Specifically, HProPro contains function declaration and function implementation to perform hybrid information-seeking over data from various sources and modalities, which enables reasoning over such data without training specialized retrievers or performing modal transformations. Experimental results on two typical hybrid question answering benchmarks HybridQA and MultiModalQA demonstrate the effectiveness of HProPro: it surpasses all baseline systems and achieves the best performances in the few-shot settings on both datasets.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.594	Qi Shi, Han Cui, Haofeng Wang, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che, Ting Liu
CLOMO: Counterfactual Logical Modification with Large Language Models	In this study, we delve into the realm of counterfactual reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Our primary objective is to cultivate the counterfactual thought processes within LLMs and rigorously assess these processes for their validity. Specifically, we introduce a novel task, Counterfactual Logical Modification (CLOMO), and a high-quality human-annotated benchmark. In this task, LLMs must adeptly alter a given argumentative text to uphold a predetermined logical relationship. To effectively evaluate a generation model's counterfactual capabilities, we propose an innovative evaluation metric, the decomposed Self-Evaluation Score (SES) to directly evaluate the natural language output of LLMs instead of modeling the task as a multiple-choice problem. Analysis shows that the proposed automatic metric aligns well with human preference. Our experimental results show that while LLMs demonstrate a notable capacity for logical counterfactual thinking, there remains a discernible gap between their current abilities and human performance.

Hide and Seek in Noise Labels: Noise-Robust Collaborative Active Learning with LLMs-Powered Assistance	Learning from noisy labels (LNL) is a challenge that arises in many real-world scenarios where collected training data can contain incorrect or corrupted labels. Most existing solutions identify noisy labels and adopt active learning to query human experts on them for denoising. In the era of large language models (LLMs), although we can reduce the human effort to improve these methods, their performances are still subject to accurately separating the clean and noisy samples from noisy data. In this paper, we propose an innovative collaborative learning framework NoiseAL based on active learning to combine LLMs and small models (SMs) for learning from noisy labels. During collaborative training, we first adopt two SMs to form a co-prediction network and propose a dynamic-enhanced threshold strategy to divide the noisy data into different subsets, then select the clean and noisy samples from these subsets to feed the active annotator LLMs to rectify noisy samples. Finally, we employ different optimization objectives to conquer subsets with different degrees of label noises. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world noise datasets further demonstrate the superiority of our framework over state-of-the-art baselines.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.592	Bo Yuan, Yulin Chen, Yin Zhang, Wei Jiang
PRP: Propagating Universal Perturbations to Attack Large Language Model Guard-Rails	Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to be harmless to humans. Unfortunately, recent work has shown that such models are susceptible to automated jailbreak attacks that induce them to generate harmful content. More recent LLMs often incorporate an additional layer of defense, a Guard Model, which is a second LLM that is designed to check and moderate the output response of the primary LLM. Our key contribution is to show a novel attack strategy, PRP, that is successful against several open-source (e.g., Llama 2) and closed-source (e.g., GPT 3.5) implementations of Guard Models. PRP leverages a two step prefix-based attack that operates by (a) constructing a universal adversarial prefix for the Guard Model, and (b) propagating this prefix to the response. We find that this procedure is effective across multiple threat models, including ones in which the adversary has no access to the Guard Model at all. Our work suggests that further advances are required on defenses and Guard Models before they can be considered effective.

Chat Vector: A Simple Approach to Equip LLMs with Instruction Following and Model Alignment in New Languages	Recently, the development of open-source large language models (LLMs) has advanced rapidly. Nevertheless, due to data constraints, the capabilities of most open-source LLMs are primarily focused on English. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of chat vector to equip pre-trained language models with instruction following and human value alignment via simple model arithmetic. The chat vector is derived by subtracting the weights of a pre-trained base model (e.g. LLaMA2) from those of its corresponding chat model (e.g. LLaMA2-chat). By simply adding the chat vector to a continual pre-trained model's weights, we can endow the model with chat capabilities in new languages without the need for further training.Our empirical studies demonstrate the superior efficacy of the chat vector from three different aspects: instruction following, toxicity mitigation, and multi-turn dialogue. Moreover, to showcase the adaptability of our approach, we extend our experiments to encompass various languages, base models, and chat vectors. The results underscore the chat vector's simplicity, effectiveness, and wide applicability, making it a compelling solution for efficiently enabling conversational capabilities in pre-trained language models.

Make-A-Voice: Revisiting Voice Large Language Models as Scalable Multilingual and Multitask Learners	Large language models (LLMs) have successfully served as a general-purpose interface across multiple tasks and languages, while the adaptation of voice LLMs is mostly designed for specific purposes (either single-task or monolingual), where the advantages of LLMs especially for low-resource language processing and zero-shot task generalization are less exploited in the audio community. To bridge the gap, we introduce Make-A-Voice as a multi-modal voice LLM and conduct a comprehensive study on its capability to deal with multiple tasks/languages. When trained on ~200K hours of 6-language data for 4 voice generation applications, Make-A-Voice emerges notable advantages: 1) as scalable learners to improve performance with end-to-end local and global multiscale transformers; and 2) as multitask learners by adjusting prompts to share common knowledge across modalities (speech/singing) and present in-context learning abilities by generalizing to unseen tasks not explicitly train on; 3) as multilingual learners to alleviate data scarcity of low-resource languages by including rich-resource language training data. Experimental results demonstrate that Make-A-Voice exhibits superior audio quality and style similarity compared with competitive baseline models in monolingual/cross-lingual voice generation.

Continual Learning with Semi-supervised Contrastive Distillation for Incremental Neural Machine Translation	Incrementally expanding the capability of an existing translation model to solve new domain tasks over time is a fundamental and practical problem, which usually suffers from catastrophic forgetting. Generally, multi-domain learning can be seen as a good solution. However, there are two drawbacks: 1) it requires having the training data for all domains available at the same time, which may be unrealistic due to storage or privacy concerns; 2) it requires re-training the model on the data of all domains from scratch when adding a new domain and this is time-consuming and computationally expensive. To address these issues, we present a semi-supervised contrastive distillation framework for incremental neural machine translation. Specifically, to avoid catastrophic forgetting, we propose to exploit unlabeled data from the same distributions of the older domains through knowledge distillation. Further, to ensure the distinct domain characteristics in the model as the number of domains increases, we devise a cross-domain contrastive objective to enhance the distilled knowledge. Extensive experiments on domain translation benchmarks show that our approach, without accessing any previous training data or re-training on all domains from scratch, can significantly prevent the model from forgetting previously learned knowledge while obtaining good performance on the incrementally added domains. The code and data with step-by-step instructions will be released upon acceptance.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.588	Yunlong Liang, Fandong Meng, Jiaan Wang, Jinan Xu, Yufeng Chen, Jie Zhou
Revisiting Knowledge Distillation for Autoregressive Language Models	Knowledge distillation (KD) is a common approach to compress a teacher model to reduce its inference cost and memory footprint, by training a smaller student model. However, in the context of autoregressive language models (LMs), we empirically find that larger teacher LMs might dramatically result in a poorer student. In response to this problem, we conduct a series of analyses and reveal that different tokens have different teaching modes, neglecting which will lead to performance degradation. Motivated by this, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive teaching approach (ATKD) to improve the KD. The core of ATKD is to reduce rote learning and make teaching more diverse and flexible. Extensive experiments on 8 LM tasks show that, with the help of ATKD, various baseline KD methods can achieve consistent and significant performance gains (up to +3.04% average score) across all model types and sizes. More encouragingly, ATKD can improve the student model generalization effectively.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.587	Qihuang Zhong, Liang Ding, Li Shen, Juhua Liu, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao
The Dawn After the Dark: An Empirical Study on Factuality Hallucination in Large Language Models	In the era of large language models (LLMs), hallucination (the tendency to generate factually incorrect content) poses great challenges to trustworthy and reliable deployment of LLMs in real-world applications. To tackle the hallucination, three key questions should be well studied: how to detect hallucinations (detection), why do LLMs hallucinate (source), and what can be done to mitigate them (mitigation). To address these challenges, this work presents a systematic empirical study on LLM hallucinations, focused on the three aspects of hallucination detection, source and mitigation. Specially, we construct a new hallucination benchmark HaluEval 2.0, and design a simple yet effective detection method for LLM hallucinations. Furthermore, we zoom into the different training or utilization stages of LLMs and extensively analyze the potential factors that lead to the LLM hallucinations. Finally, we implement and examine a series of widely used techniques to mitigate the hallucinations in LLMs. Our work has led to several important findings to understand the hallucination origin and mitigate the hallucinations in LLMs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.586	Junyi Li, Jie Chen, Ruiyang Ren, Xiaoxue Cheng, Xin Zhao, Jian-Yun Nie, Ji-Rong Wen
RAGTruth: A Hallucination Corpus for Developing Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Language Models	Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a main technique for alleviating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Despite the integration of RAG, LLMs may still present unsupported or contradictory claims to the retrieved contents. In order to develop effective hallucination prevention strategies under RAG, it is important to create benchmark datasets that can measure the extent of hallucination. This paper presents RAGTruth, a corpus tailored for analyzing word-level hallucinations in various domains and tasks within the standard RAG frameworks for LLM applications. RAGTruth comprises nearly 18,000 naturally generated responses from diverse LLMs using RAG. These responses have undergone meticulous manual annotations at both the individual case and word levels, incorporating evaluations of hallucination intensity. We not only benchmark hallucination frequencies across different LLMs, but also critically assess the effectiveness of several existing hallucination detection methodologies. We show that using a high-quality dataset such as RAGTruth, it is possible to finetune a relatively small LLM and achieve a competitive hallucination detection performance when compared to the existing prompt-based approaches using state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4. Furthermore, the finetuned model can effectively mitigate hallucination in LLM responses.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.585	Cheng Niu, Yuanhao Wu, Juno Zhu, Siliang Xu, KaShun Shum, Randy Zhong, Juntong Song, Tong Zhang
Navigating the Shadows: Unveiling Effective Disturbances for Modern AI Content Detectors	With the launch of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have attracted global attention. In the realm of article writing, LLMs have witnessed extensive utilization, giving rise to concerns related to intellectual property protection, personal privacy, and academic integrity. In response, AI-text detection has emerged to distinguish between human and machine-generated content. However, recent research indicates that these detection systems often lack robustness and struggle to effectively differentiate perturbed texts. Currently, there is a lack of systematic evaluations regarding detection performance in real-world applications, and a comprehensive examination of perturbation techniques and detector robustness is also absent. To bridge this gap, our work simulates real-world scenarios in both informal and professional writing, exploring the out-of-the-box performance of current detectors. Additionally, we have constructed 12 black-box text perturbation methods to assess the robustness of current detection models across various perturbation granularities. Furthermore, through adversarial learning experiments, we investigate the impact of perturbation data augmentation on the robustness of AI-text detectors. We have released our code and data at https://github.com/zhouying20/ai-text-detector-evaluation.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.584	Ying Zhou, Ben He, Le Sun
PAGED: A Benchmark for Procedural Graphs Extraction from Documents	Automatic extraction of procedural graphs from documents creates a low-cost way for users to easily understand a complex procedure by skimming visual graphs. Despite the progress in recent studies, it remains unanswered: whether the existing studies have well solved this task (Q1) and whether the emerging large language models (LLMs) can bring new opportunities to this task (Q2). To this end, we propose a new benchmark PAGED, equipped with a large high-quality dataset and standard evaluations. It investigates five state-of-the-art baselines, revealing that they fail to extract optimal procedural graphs well because of their heavy reliance on hand-written rules and limited available data. We further involve three advanced LLMs in PAGED and enhance them with a novel self-refine strategy. The results point out the advantages of LLMs in identifying textual elements and their gaps in building logical structures. We hope PAGED can serve as a major landmark for automatic procedural graph extraction and the investigations in PAGED can offer insights into the research on logic reasoning among non-sequential elements.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.583	Weihong Du, Wenrui Liao, Hongru Liang, Wenqiang Lei
Enhancing Numerical Reasoning with the Guidance of Reliable Reasoning Processes	"Numerical reasoning is an essential ability for NLP systems to handle numeric information. Recent research indicates that fine-tuning a small-scale model to learn generating reasoning processes alongside answers can significantly enhance performance. However, current methods have the limitation that most methods generate reasoning processes with large language models (LLMs), which are ""unreliable"" since such processes could contain information unrelated to the answer. To address this limitation, we introduce enhancing numerical reasoning with reliable processes (Encore), which derives the reliable reasoning process by decomposing the answer formula, ensuring which fully supports the answer. Nevertheless, models could lack enough data to learn the reasoning process generation adequately, since our method generates only one single reasoning process for one formula. To overcome this difficulty, we present a series of pre-training tasks to help models learn the reasoning process generation with synthesized data. The experiments show that Encore yields improvement on all five experimental datasets with an average of 1.8%, proving the effectiveness of our method."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.582	Dingzirui Wang, Longxu Dou, Xuanliang Zhang, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che
CARE: A Clue-guided Assistant for CSRs to Read User Manuals	It is time-saving to build a reading assistant for customer service representations (CSRs) when reading user manuals, especially information-rich ones. Current solutions don't fit the online custom service scenarios well due to the lack of attention to user questions and possible responses. Hence, we propose to develop a time-saving and careful reading assistant for CSRs, named CARE. It can help the CSRs quickly find proper responses from the user manuals via explicit clue chains. Specifically, each of the clue chains is formed by inferring over the user manuals, starting from the question clue aligned with the user question and ending at a possible response. To overcome the shortage of supervised data, we adopt the self-supervised strategy for model learning. The offline experiment shows that CARE is efficient in automatically inferring accurate responses from the user manual. The online experiment further demonstrates the superiority of CARE to reduce CSRs' reading burden and keep high service quality, in particular with >35% decrease in time spent and keeping a >0.75 ICC score.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.581	Weihong Du, Jia Liu, Zujie Wen, Dingnan Jin, Hongru Liang, Wenqiang Lei
Confidence is not Timeless: Modeling Temporal Validity for Rule-based Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting	Recently, Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting (TKGF) has emerged as a pivotal domain for forecasting future events. Unlike black-box neural network methods, rule-based approaches are lauded for their efficiency and interpretability. For this line of work, it is crucial to correctly estimate the predictive effectiveness of the rules, i.e., the confidence. However, the existing literature lacks in-depth investigation into how confidence evolves with time. Moreover, inaccurate and heuristic confidence estimation limits the performance of rule-based methods. To alleviate such issues, we propose a framework named TempValid to explicitly model the temporal validity of rules for TKGF. Specifically, we design a time function to model the interaction between temporal information with confidence. TempValid conceptualizes confidence and other coefficients as learnable parameters to avoid inaccurate estimation and combinatorial explosion. Furthermore, we introduce a rule-adversarial negative sampling and a time-aware negative sampling strategies to facilitate TempValid learning. Extensive experiments show that TempValid significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) rule-based methods on six TKGF datasets. Moreover, it exhibits substantial advancements in cross-domain and resource-constrained rule learning scenarios.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.580	Rikui Huang, Wei Wei, Xiaoye Qu, Shengzhe Zhang, Dangyang Chen, Yu Cheng
Multimodal Reasoning with Multimodal Knowledge Graph	Multimodal reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often suffers from hallucinations and the presence of deficient or outdated knowledge within LLMs. Some approaches have sought to mitigate these issues by employing textual knowledge graphs, but their singular modality of knowledge limits comprehensive cross-modal understanding. In this paper, we propose the Multimodal Reasoning with Multimodal Knowledge Graph (MR-MKG) method, which leverages multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) to learn rich and semantic knowledge across modalities, significantly enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In particular, a relation graph attention network is utilized for encoding MMKGs and a cross-modal alignment module is designed for optimizing image-text alignment. A MMKG-grounded dataset is constructed to equip LLMs with initial expertise in multimodal reasoning through pretraining. Remarkably, MR-MKG achieves superior performance while training on only a small fraction of parameters, approximately 2.25% of the LLM's parameter size. Experimental results on multimodal question answering and multimodal analogy reasoning tasks demonstrate that our MR-MKG method outperforms previous state-of-the-art models.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.579	Junlin Lee, Yequan Wang, Jing Li, Min Zhang
CLAMBER: A Benchmark of Identifying and Clarifying Ambiguous Information Needs in Large Language Models	Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to meet user information needs, but their effectiveness in dealing with user queries that contain various types of ambiguity remains unknown, ultimately risking user trust and satisfaction. To this end, we introduce CLAMBER, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs using a well-organized taxonomy. Building upon the taxonomy, we construct 12K high-quality data to assess the strengths, weaknesses, and potential risks of various off-the-shelf LLMs.Our findings indicate the limited practical utility of current LLMs in identifying and clarifying ambiguous user queries, even enhanced by chain-of-thought (CoT) and few-shot prompting. These techniques may result in overconfidence in LLMs and yield only marginal enhancements in identifying ambiguity. Furthermore, current LLMs fall short in generating high-quality clarifying questions due to a lack of conflict resolution and inaccurate utilization of inherent knowledge.In this paper, CLAMBER presents a guidance and promotes further research on proactive and trustworthy LLMs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.578	Tong Zhang, Peixin Qin, Yang Deng, Chen Huang, Wenqiang Lei, Junhong Liu, Dingnan Jin, Hongru Liang, Tat-Seng Chua
Ask Again, Then Fail: Large Language Models’ Vacillations in Judgment	We observe that current large language models often waver in their judgments when faced with follow-up questions, even if the original judgment was correct. This wavering presents a significant challenge for generating reliable responses and building user trust. To comprehensively assess this issue, we introduce a Follow-up Questioning Mechanism along with two metrics to quantify this inconsistency, confirming its widespread presence in current large language models. Furthermore, to mitigate this issue, we explore various prompting strategies for closed-source models, and develop a training-based framework Unwavering-FQ that teaches large language models to maintain their originally correct judgments through synthesized high-quality preference data. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our framework and its ability to enhance the general capabilities of large language models.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.577	Qiming Xie, Zengzhi Wang, Yi Feng, Rui Xia
Prompted Aspect Key Point Analysis for Quantitative Review Summarization	Key Point Analysis (KPA) aims for quantitative summarization that provides key points (KPs) as succinct textual summaries and quantities measuring their prevalence. KPA studies for arguments and reviews have been reported in the literature. A majority of KPA studies for reviews adopt supervised learning to extract short sentences as KPs before matching KPs to review comments for quantification of KP prevalence. Recent abstractive approaches still generate KPs based on sentences, often leading to KPs with overlapping and hallucinated opinions, and inaccurate quantification. In this paper, we propose Prompted Aspect Key Point Analysis (PAKPA) for quantitative review summarization. PAKPA employs aspect sentiment analysis and prompted in-context learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and quantify KPs grounded in aspects for business entities, which achieves faithful KPs with accurate quantification, and removes the need for large amounts of annotated data for supervised training. Experiments on the popular review dataset Yelp and the aspect-oriented review summarization dataset SPACE show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.

PolCLIP: A Unified Image-Text Word Sense Disambiguation Model via Generating Multimodal Complementary Representations	Word sense disambiguation (WSD) can be viewed as two subtasks: textual word sense disambiguation (Textual-WSD) and visual word sense disambiguation (Visual-WSD). They aim to identify the most semantically relevant senses or images to a given context containing ambiguous target words. However, existing WSD models seldom address these two subtasks jointly due to lack of images in Textual-WSD datasets or lack of senses in Visual-WSD datasets. To bridge this gap, we propose PolCLIP, a unified image-text WSD model. By employing an image-text complementarity strategy, it not only simulates stable diffusion models to generate implicit visual representations for word senses but also simulates image captioning models to provide implicit textual representations for images. Additionally, a disambiguation-oriented image-sense dataset is constructed for the training objective of learning multimodal polysemy representations. To the best of our knowledge, PolCLIP is the first model that can cope with both Textual-WSD and Visual-WSD. Extensive experimental results on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a 2.53% F1-score increase over the state-of-the-art models on Textual-WSD and a 2.22% HR@1 improvement on Visual-WSD.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.575	Qihao Yang, Yong Li, Xuelin Wang, Fu Lee Wang, Tianyong Hao
ARAIDA: Analogical Reasoning-Augmented Interactive Data Annotation	Human annotation is a time-consuming task that requires a significant amount of effort. To address this issue, interactive data annotation utilizes an annotation model to provide suggestions for humans to approve or correct. However, annotation models trained with limited labeled data are prone to generating incorrect suggestions, leading to extra human correction effort. To tackle this challenge, we propose Araida, an analogical reasoning-based approach that enhances automatic annotation accuracy in the interactive data annotation setting and reduces the need for human corrections. Araida involves an error-aware integration strategy that dynamically coordinates an annotation model and a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) model, giving more importance to KNN's predictions when predictions from the annotation model are deemed inaccurate. Empirical studies demonstrate that Araida is adaptable to different annotation tasks and models. On average, it reduces human correction labor by 11.02% compared to vanilla interactive data annotation methods.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.574	Chen Huang, Yiping Jin, Ilija Ilievski, Wenqiang Lei, Jiancheng Lv
CODIS: Benchmarking Context-dependent Visual Comprehension for Multimodal Large Language Models	Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising results in a variety of tasks that combine vision and language. As these models become more integral to research and applications, conducting comprehensive evaluations of their capabilities has grown increasingly important. However, most existing benchmarks fail to consider that, in certain situations, images need to be interpreted within a broader context. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark, named as CODIS, designed to assess the ability of models to use context provided in free-form text to enhance visual comprehension. Our findings indicate that MLLMs consistently fall short of human performance on this benchmark. Further analysis confirms that these models struggle to effectively extract and utilize contextual information to improve their understanding of images. This underscores the pressing need to enhance the ability of MLLMs to comprehend visuals in a context-dependent manner.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.573	Fuwen Luo, Chi Chen, Zihao Wan, Zhaolu Kang, Qidong Yan, Yingjie Li, Xiaolong Wang, Siyu Wang, Ziyue Wang, Xiaoyue Mi, Peng Li, Ning Ma, Maosong Sun, Yang Liu
Aligning Large Language Models with Human Preferences through Representation Engineering	Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for enhancing their utility in terms of helpfulness, truthfulness, safety, harmlessness, and interestingness. Existing methods for achieving this alignment often involve employing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune LLMs based on human labels assessing the relative quality of model responses. Nevertheless, RLHF is susceptible to instability during fine-tuning and presents challenges in implementation. Drawing inspiration from the emerging field of representation engineering (RepE), this study aims to identify relevant representations for high-level human preferences embedded in patterns of activity within an LLM and achieve precise control of model behavior by transforming its representations. This novel approach, denoted as Representation Alignment from Human Feedback (RAHF), proves to be effective, computationally efficient, and easy to implement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of RAHF in not only capturing but also manipulating representations to align with a broad spectrum of human preferences or values, rather than being confined to a singular concept or function (e.g. honesty or bias). RAHF's versatility in accommodating diverse human preferences shows its potential for advancing LLM performance.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.572	Wenhao Liu, Xiaohua Wang, Muling Wu, Tianlong Li, Changze Lv, Zixuan Ling, Zhu JianHao, Cenyuan Zhang, Xiaoqing Zheng, Xuanjing Huang
HyperMoE: Towards Better Mixture of Experts via Transferring Among Experts	The Mixture of Experts (MoE) for language models has been proven effective in augmenting the capacity of models by dynamically routing each input token to a specific subset of experts for processing. Despite the success, most existing methods face a challenge for balance between sparsity and the availability of expert knowledge: enhancing performance through increased use of expert knowledge often results in diminishing sparsity during expert selection. To mitigate this contradiction, we propose HyperMoE, a novel MoE framework built upon Hypernetworks. This framework integrates the computational processes of MoE with the concept of knowledge transferring in multi-task learning. Specific modules generated based on the information of unselected experts serve as supplementary information, which allows the knowledge of experts not selected to be used while maintaining selection sparsity. Our comprehensive empirical evaluations across multiple datasets and backbones establish that HyperMoE significantly outperforms existing MoE methods under identical conditions concerning the number of experts.

LLMs in the Imaginarium: Tool Learning through Simulated Trial and Error	Tools are essential for large language models (LLMs) to acquire up-to-date information and take consequential actions in external environments. Existing work on tool-augmented LLMs primarily focuses on the broad coverage of tools and the flexibility of adding new tools. However, a critical aspect that has surprisingly been understudied is simply how accurately an LLM uses tools for which it has been trained. We find that existing LLMs, including GPT-4 and open-source LLMs specifically fine-tuned for tool use, only reach a correctness rate in the range of 30% to 60%, far from reliable use in practice. We propose a biologically inspired method for tool-augmented LLMs, simulated trial and error (STE), that orchestrates three key mechanisms for successful tool use behaviors in the biological system: trial and error, imagination, and memory. Specifically, STE leverages an LLM's 'imagination' to simulate plausible scenarios for using a tool, after which the LLM interacts with the tool to learn from its execution feedback. Both short-term and long-term memory are employed to improve the depth and breadth of the exploration, respectively. Comprehensive experiments on ToolBench show that STE substantially improves tool learning for LLMs under both in-context learning and fine-tuning settings, bringing a boost of 46.7% to Mistral-Instruct-7B and enabling it to outperform GPT-4. We also show effective continual learning of tools via a simple experience replay strategy.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.570	Boshi Wang, Hao Fang, Jason Eisner, Benjamin Van Durme, Yu Su
Interactive-KBQA: Multi-Turn Interactions for Knowledge Base Question Answering with Large Language Models	This study explores the realm of knowledge base question answering (KBQA). KBQA is considered a challenging task, particularly in parsing intricate questions into executable logical forms. Traditional semantic parsing (SP)-based methods require extensive data annotations, which result in significant costs. Recently, the advent of few-shot in-context learning, powered by large language models (LLMs), has showcased promising capabilities. Yet, fully leveraging LLMs to parse questions into logical forms in low-resource scenarios poses a substantial challenge. To tackle these hurdles, we introduce Interactive-KBQA, a framework designed to generate logical forms through direct interaction with knowledge bases (KBs). Within this framework, we have developed three generic APIs for KB interaction. For each category of complex question, we devised exemplars to guide LLMs through the reasoning processes. Our method achieves competitive results on the WebQuestionsSP, ComplexWebQuestions, KQA Pro, and MetaQA datasets with a minimal number of examples (shots). Importantly, our approach supports manual intervention, allowing for the iterative refinement of LLM outputs. By annotating a dataset with step-wise reasoning processes, we showcase our model's adaptability and highlight its potential for contributing significant enhancements to the field.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.569	Guanming Xiong, Junwei Bao, Wen Zhao
Defending Against Alignment-Breaking Attacks via Robustly Aligned LLM	Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advancements and are now widely used across various domains. Unfortunately, there has been a rising concern that LLMs can be misused to generate harmful or malicious content. Though a line of research has focused on aligning LLMs with human values and preventing them from producing inappropriate content, such alignments are usually vulnerable and can be bypassed by alignment-breaking attacks via adversarially optimized or handcrafted jailbreaking prompts. In this work, we introduce a Robustly Aligned LLM (RA-LLM) to defend against potential alignment-breaking attacks. RA-LLM can be directly constructed upon an existing aligned LLM with a robust alignment checking function, without requiring any expensive retraining or fine-tuning process of the original LLM. Furthermore, we also provide a theoretical analysis for RA-LLM to verify its effectiveness in defending against alignment-breaking attacks. Through real-world experiments on open-source large language models, we demonstrate that RA-LLM can successfully defend against both state-of-the-art adversarial prompts and popular handcrafted jailbreaking prompts by reducing their attack success rates from nearly 100% to around 10% or less.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.568	Bochuan Cao, Yuanpu Cao, Lu Lin, Jinghui Chen
Simul-LLM: A Framework for Exploring High-Quality Simultaneous Translation with Large Language Models	Large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters and pretrained on massive amounts of data are now capable of near or better than state-of-the-art performance in a variety of downstream natural language processing tasks. Neural machine translation (NMT) is one such task that LLMs have been applied to with great success. However, little research has focused on applying LLMs to the more difficult subset of NMT called simultaneous translation (SimulMT), where translation begins before the entire source context is available to the model. In this paper, we address key challenges facing LLMs fine-tuned for SimulMT, validate classical SimulMT concepts and practices in the context of LLMs, explore adapting LLMs that are fine-tuned for NMT to the task of SimulMT, and introduce Simul-LLM, the first open-source fine-tuning and evaluation pipeline development framework for LLMs focused on SimulMT.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.567	Victor Agostinelli, Max Wild, Matthew Raffel, Kazi Fuad, Lizhong Chen
Pareto Optimal Learning for Estimating Large Language Model Errors	Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in many applications. When a concrete and precise answer is desired, it is important to have a quantitative estimation of the potential error rate. However, this can be challenging due to the text-in-text-out nature of the generative models. We present a method based on Pareto optimization that generates a risk score to estimate the probability of error in an LLM response by integrating multiple sources of information. We prove theoretically that the error estimator optimized in our framework aligns with the LLM and the information sources in an Pareto optimal manner. Experimental results show that the risk scores estimated by our method are well correlated with the true LLM error rate, thus facilitating error correction. By dynamically combining with prompting strategies such as self-verification and information retrieval, we demonstrate the proposed method can be utilized to increase the performance of an LLM, surpassing state-of-the-art task specific model.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.566	Theodore Zhao, Mu Wei, J.

Characterizing Similarities and Divergences in Conversational Tones in Humans and LLMs by Sampling with People	Conversational tones — the manners and attitudes in which speakers communicate — are essential to effective communication. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly popular, it is necessary to characterize the divergences in their conversational tones relative to humans. Prior research relied on pre-existing taxonomies or text corpora, which suffer from experimenter bias and may not be representative of real-world distributions. Inspired by methods from cognitive science, we propose an iterative method for simultaneously eliciting conversational tones and sentences, where participants alternate between two tasks: (1) one participant identifies the tone of a given sentence and (2) a different participant generates a sentence based on that tone. We run 50 iterations of this process with both human participants and GPT-4 and obtain a dataset of sentences and frequent conversational tones. In an additional experiment, humans and GPT-4 annotated all sentences with all tones. With data from 1,339 participants, 33,370 human judgments, and 29,900 GPT-4 queries, we show how our approach can be used to create an interpretable geometric representation of relations between tones in humans and GPT-4. This work showcases how combining ideas from machine learning and cognitive science can address challenges in human-computer interactions.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.565	Dun-Ming Huang, Pol Van Rijn, Ilia Sucholutsky, Raja Marjieh, Nori Jacoby
Learning Relational Decomposition of Queries for Question Answering from Tables	Table Question-Answering involves both understanding the natural language query and grounding it in the context of the input table to extract relevant information. In this context, many methods have highlighted the benefits of intermediate pre-training using SQL queries. However, while most approaches aim at generating final answers directly from inputs, we claim that there is better to do with SQL queries during training.By learning to imitate a restricted subset of SQL-like algebraic operations, we demonstrate that their execution flow provides intermediate supervision steps that allow for increased generalization and structural reasoning compared to classical approaches. Our method, bridges the gap between semantic parsing and direct answering methods, offering valuable insights into which types of operations should be predicted by a generative architecture and which should be executed by an external algorithm.

Large Language Models Can Learn Temporal Reasoning	While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, they are not without their flaws and inaccuracies. Recent studies have introduced various methods to mitigate these limitations. Temporal reasoning (TR), in particular, presents a significant challenge for LLMs due to its reliance on diverse temporal concepts and intricate temporal logic. In this paper, we propose TG-LLM, a novel framework towards language-based TR. Instead of reasoning over the original context, we adopt a latent representation, temporal graph (TG) that enhances the learning of TR. A synthetic dataset (TGQA), which is fully controllable and requires minimal supervision, is constructed for fine-tuning LLMs on this text-to-TG translation task. We confirmed in experiments that the capability of TG translation learned on our dataset can be transferred to other TR tasks and benchmarks. On top of that, we teach LLM to perform deliberate reasoning over the TGs via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) bootstrapping and graph data augmentation. We observed that those strategies, which maintain a balance between usefulness and diversity, bring more reliable CoTs and final results than the vanilla CoT distillation.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.563	Siheng Xiong, Ali Payani, Ramana Kompella, Faramarz Fekri
Bridging the Preference Gap between Retrievers and LLMs	"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior results across a wide range of tasks, and Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is an effective way to enhance the performance by locating relevant information and placing it into the context window of the LLM. However, the relationship between retrievers and LLMs in a RAG is still under-investigated. Most existing work treats the retriever and the LLM as independent components and leaves a gap between retrieving human-""friendly"" information and assembling a LLM-""friendly"" context. In this work, we examine a novel bridge mechanism. We validate the ranking and selection assumptions of retrievers in the context of RAG and propose a framework that chains together supervised and reinforcement learning to train a bridge model that optimizes the connection between the retriever and the LLM. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both question-answering and personalized generation tasks."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.562	Zixuan Ke, Weize Kong, Cheng Li, Mingyang Zhang, Qiaozhu Mei, Michael Bendersky
Re-Tuning: Overcoming the Compositionality Limits of Large Language Models with Recursive Tuning	We present a new method for large language models to solve compositional tasks. Although they have shown strong performance on traditional language understanding tasks, large language models struggle to solve compositional tasks, where the solution depends on solving smaller instances of the same problem. We propose a natural approach to solve compositional tasks recursively. Our method, Re-Tuning, tunes models to break down a problem into subproblems, solve those subproblems, and combine the results. We show that our method significantly improves model performance on three representative compositional tasks: integer addition, dynamic programming, and parity. Compared to state-of-the-art methods that keep intermediate steps towards solving the problems, Re-Tuning achieves significantly higher accuracy and is more GPU memory efficient.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.561	Eric Pasewark, Kyle Montgomery, Kefei Duan, Dawn Song, Chenguang Wang
Examining the robustness of LLM evaluation to the distributional assumptions of benchmarks	Benchmarks have emerged as the central approach for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs). The research community often relies on a model's average performance across the test prompts of a benchmark to evaluate the model's performance. This is consistent with the assumption that the test prompts within a benchmark represent a random sample from some real-world distribution of interest. We note that this is generally not the case; instead, we hold that the distribution of interest varies according to the specific use case. Hence, we analyze the robustness of LLM benchmarks to their underlying distributional assumptions. We find that (1) the correlation in model performance across test prompts is non-random, (2) accounting for correlations across test prompts can change model rankings on major benchmarks, (3) explanatory factors for these correlations include semantic similarity and common LLM failure points.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.560	Charlotte Siska, Katerina Marazopoulou, Melissa Ailem, James Bono
AGB-DE: A Corpus for the Automated Legal Assessment of Clauses in German Consumer Contracts	Legal tasks and datasets are often used as benchmarks for the capabilities of language models. However, openly available annotated datasets are rare. In this paper, we introduce AGB-DE, a corpus of 3,764 clauses from German consumer contracts that have been annotated and legally assessed by legal experts. Together with the data, we present a first baseline for the task of detecting potentially void clauses, comparing the performance of an SVM baseline with three fine-tuned open language models and the performance of GPT-3.5. Our results show the challenging nature of the task, with no approach exceeding an F1-score of 0.54. While the fine-tuned models often performed better with regard to precision, GPT-3.5 outperformed the other approaches with regard to recall. An analysis of the errors indicates that one of the main challenges could be the correct interpretation of complex clauses, rather than the decision boundaries of what is permissible and what is not.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.559	Daniel Braun, Florian Matthes
MindMap: Knowledge Graph Prompting Sparks Graph of Thoughts in Large Language Models	Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, they often suffer from limitations such as difficulty in incorporating new knowledge, generating hallucinations, and explaining their reasoning process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompting pipeline, named MindMap, that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance LLMs' inference and transparency. Our method enables LLMs to comprehend KG inputs and infer with a combination of implicit and external knowledge. Moreover, our method elicits the mind map of LLMs, which reveals their reasoning pathways based on the ontology of knowledge. We evaluate our method on diverse question & answering tasks, especially in medical domains, and show significant improvements over baselines. We also introduce a new hallucination evaluation benchmark and analyze the effects of different components of our method. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method in merging knowledge from LLMs and KGs for combined inference.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.558	Yilin Wen, Zifeng Wang, Jimeng Sun
SyllabusQA: A Course Logistics Question Answering Dataset	Automated teaching assistants and chatbots have significant potential to reduce the workload of human instructors, especially for logistics-related question answering, which is important to students yet repetitive for instructors. However, due to privacy concerns, there is a lack of publicly available datasets. We introduce SyllabusQA, an open-source dataset with 63 real course syllabi covering 36 majors, containing 5,078 open-ended course logistics-related question-answer pairs that are diverse in both question types and answer formats. Since many logistics-related questions contain critical information like the date of an exam, it is important to evaluate the factuality of answers. We benchmark several strong baselines on this task, from large language model prompting to retrieval-augmented generation. We introduce Fact-QA, an LLM-based (GPT-4) evaluation metric to evaluate the factuality of predicted answers. We find that despite performing close to humans on traditional metrics of textual similarity, there remains a significant gap between automated approaches and humans in terms of fact precision.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.557	Nigel Fernandez, Alexander Scarlatos, Andrew Lan
Retrieval Augmented Fact Verification by Synthesizing Contrastive Arguments	The rapid propagation of misinformation poses substantial risks to public interest. To combat misinformation, large language models (LLMs) are adapted to automatically verify claim credibility. Nevertheless, existing methods heavily rely on the embedded knowledge within LLMs and / or black-box APIs for evidence collection, leading to subpar performance with smaller LLMs or upon unreliable context. In this paper, we propose retrieval augmented fact verification through the synthesis of contrasting arguments (RAFTS). Upon input claims, RAFTS starts with evidence retrieval, where we design a retrieval pipeline to collect and re-rank relevant documents from verifiable sources. Then, RAFTS forms contrastive arguments (i.e., supporting or refuting) conditioned on the retrieved evidence. In addition, RAFTS leverages an embedding model to identify informative demonstrations, followed by in-context prompting to generate the prediction and explanation. Our method effectively retrieves relevant documents as evidence and evaluates arguments from varying perspectives, incorporating nuanced information for fine-grained decision-making. Combined with informative in-context examples as prior, RAFTS achieves significant improvements to supervised and LLM baselines without complex prompts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments, where RAFTS can outperform GPT-based methods with a significantly smaller 7B LLM.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.556	Zhenrui Yue, Huimin Zeng, Lanyu Shang, Yifan Liu, Yang Zhang, Dong Wang
Artifacts or Abduction: How Do LLMs Answer Multiple-Choice Questions Without the Question?	Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is often used to evaluate large language models (LLMs). To see if MCQA assesses LLMs as intended, we probe if LLMs can perform MCQA with choices-only prompts, where models must select the correct answer only from the choices. In three MCQA datasets and four LLMs, this prompt bests a majority baseline in 11/12 cases, with up to 0.33 accuracy gain. To help explain this behavior, we conduct an in-depth, black-box analysis on memorization, choice dynamics, and question inference. Our key findings are threefold. First, we find no evidence that the choices-only accuracy stems from memorization alone. Second, priors over individual choices do not fully explain choices-only accuracy, hinting that LLMs use the group dynamics of choices. Third, LLMs have some ability to infer a relevant question from choices, and surprisingly can sometimes even match the original question. We hope to motivate the use of stronger baselines in MCQA benchmarks, the design of robust MCQA datasets, and further efforts to explain LLM decision-making.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.555	Nishant Balepur, Abhilasha Ravichander, Rachel Rudinger
Quantifying the Persona Effect in LLM Simulations	Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable promise in simulating human language and behavior. This study investigates how integrating persona variables—demographic, social, and behavioral factors—impacts LLMs' ability to simulate diverse perspectives. We find that persona variables account for <10% variance in annotations in existing subjective NLP datasets. Nonetheless, incorporating persona variables via prompting in LLMs provides modest but statistically significant improvements. Persona prompting is most effective in samples where many annotators disagree, but their disagreements are relatively minor. Notably, we find a linear relationship in our setting: the stronger the correlation between persona variables and human annotations, the more accurate the LLM predictions are using persona prompting. In a zero-shot setting, a powerful 70b model with persona prompting captures 81% of the annotation variance achievable by linear regression trained on ground truth annotations. However, for most subjective NLP datasets, where persona variables have limited explanatory power, the benefits of persona prompting are limited.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.554	Tiancheng Hu, Nigel Collier
BinaryAlign: Word Alignment as Binary Sequence Labeling	Real world deployments of word alignment are almost certain to cover both high and low resource languages. However, the state-of-the-art for this task recommends a different model class depending on the availability of gold alignment training data for a particular language pair. We propose BinaryAlign, a novel word alignment technique based on binary sequence labeling that outperforms existing approaches in both scenarios, offering a unifying approach to the task. Additionally, we vary the specific choice of multilingual foundation model, perform stratified error analysis over alignment error type, and explore the performance of BinaryAlign on non-English language pairs. We make our source code publicly available.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.553	Gaetan Latouche, Marc-André Carbonneau, Benjamin Swanson
MuggleMath: Assessing the Impact of Query and Response Augmentation on Math Reasoning	In math reasoning with large language models (LLMs), fine-tuning data augmentation by query evolution and diverse reasoning paths is empirically verified effective, profoundly narrowing the gap between open-sourced LLMs and cutting-edge proprietary LLMs. In this paper, we conduct an investigation for such data augmentation in math reasoning and are intended to answer: (1) What strategies of data augmentation are more effective; (2) What is the scaling relationship between the amount of augmented data and model performance; and (3) Can data augmentation incentivize generalization to out-of-domain mathematical reasoning tasks?To this end, we create two new dataset AugGSM8K and AugMATH, by complicating and diversifying the queries and sampling multiple reasoning paths from GSM8K and MATH.We obtained a series of LLMs called MuggleMath by fine-tuning LLaMA models on AugGSM8K and AugMATH. MuggleMath substantially achieves new state-of-the-art on GSM8K and MATH.A log-linear relationship and a segmented log-linear are presented between MuggleMath's performance and the amount of augmented data on GSM8K and MATH, respectively.We also find that it is weak in out-of-domain math reasoning generalization from AugGSM8K to MATH and from AugMATH to GSM8K, which suggests that augmenting queries that cover a broader range of subjects is more beneficial for generalization.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.551	Chengpeng Li, Zheng Yuan, Hongyi Yuan, Guanting Dong, Keming Lu, Jiancan Wu, Chuanqi Tan, Xiang Wang, Chang Zhou
Harnessing Toulmin’s theory for zero-shot argument explication	To better analyze informal arguments on public forums, we propose the task of argument explication, which makes explicit a text's argumentative structure and implicit reasoning by outputting triples of propositions ⟨claim, reason warrant⟩. The three slots, or argument components, are derived from the widely known Toulmin (1958) model of argumentation. While prior research applies Toulmin or related theories to annotate datasets and train supervised models, we develop an effective method to prompt generative large language models (LMs) to output explicitly named argument components proposed by Toulmin by prompting with the theory name (e.g., 'According to Toulmin model'). We evaluate the outputs' coverage and validity through a human study and automatic evaluation based on prior argumentation datasets and perform robustness checks over alternative LMs, prompts, and argumentation theories. Finally, we conduct a proof-of-concept case study to extract an interpretable argumentation (hyper)graph from a large corpus of critical public comments on whether to allow the COVID-19 vaccine for children, suggesting future directions for corpus analysis and argument visualization.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.552	Ankita Gupta, Ethan Zuckerman, Brendan O’Connor
Do Large Language Models Latently Perform Multi-Hop Reasoning?	"We study whether Large Language Models (LLMs) latently perform multi-hop reasoning with complex prompts such as ""The mother of the singer of 'Superstition' is"". We look for evidence of a latent reasoning pathway where an LLM (1) latently identifies ""the singer of 'Superstition'"" as Stevie Wonder, the bridge entity, and (2) uses its knowledge of Stevie Wonder's mother to complete the prompt. We analyze these two hops individually and consider their co-occurrence as indicative of latent multi-hop reasoning. For the first hop, we test if changing the prompt to indirectly mention the bridge entity instead of any other entity increases the LLM's internal recall of the bridge entity. For the second hop, we test if increasing this recall causes the LLM to better utilize what it knows about the bridge entity. We find strong evidence of latent multi-hop reasoning for the prompts of certain relation types, with the reasoning pathway used in more than 80% of the prompts. However, the utilization is highly contextual, varying across different types of prompts. Also, on average, the evidence for the second hop and the full multi-hop traversal is rather moderate and only substantial for the first hop. Moreover, we find a clear scaling trend with increasing model size for the first hop of reasoning but not for the second hop. Our experimental findings suggest potential challenges and opportunities for future development and applications of LLMs."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.550	Sohee Yang, Elena Gribovskaya, Nora Kassner, Mor Geva, Sebastian Riedel
OWSM-CTC: An Open Encoder-Only Speech Foundation Model for Speech Recognition, Translation, and Language Identification	There has been an increasing interest in large speech models that can perform multiple tasks in a single model. Such models usually adopt an encoder-decoder or decoder-only architecture due to their popularity and good performance in many domains. However, autoregressive models can be slower during inference compared to non-autoregressive models and also have potential risks of hallucination. Though prior studies observed promising results of non-autoregressive models for certain tasks at small scales, it remains unclear if they can be scaled to speech-to-text generation in diverse languages and tasks. Inspired by the Open Whisper-style Speech Model (OWSM) project, we propose OWSM-CTC, a novel encoder-only speech foundation model based on Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC). It is trained on 180k hours of public audio data for multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech translation (ST), and language identification (LID). Compared to encoder-decoder OWSM, our OWSM-CTC achieves competitive results on ASR and up to 24% relative improvement on ST, while it is more robust and 3 to 4 times faster for inference. OWSM-CTC also improves the long-form ASR result with 20x speed-up.We will publicly release our code, pre-trained model, and training logs to promote open science in speech foundation models.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.549	Yifan Peng, Yui Sudo, Muhammad Shakeel, Shinji Watanabe
Revisiting Structured Sentiment Analysis as Latent Dependency Graph Parsing	Structured Sentiment Analysis (SSA) was cast as a problem of bi-lexical dependency graph parsing by prior studies.Multiple formulations have been proposed to construct the graph, which share several intrinsic drawbacks:(1) The internal structures of spans are neglected, thus only the boundary tokens of spans are used for relation prediction and span recognition, thus hindering the model's expressiveness;(2) Long spans occupy a significant proportion in the SSA datasets, which further exacerbates the problem of internal structure neglect.In this paper, we treat the SSA task as a dependency parsing task on partially-observed dependency trees, regarding flat spans without determined tree annotations as latent subtrees to consider internal structures of spans.We propose a two-stage parsing method and leverage TreeCRFs with a novel constrained inside algorithm to model latent structures explicitly, which also takes advantages of joint scoring graph arcs and headed spans for global optimization and inference. Results of extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets reveal that our method performs significantly better than all previous bi-lexical methods, achieving new state-of-the-art.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.548	Chengjie Zhou, Bobo Li, Hao Fei, Fei Li, Chong Teng, Donghong Ji
Meta-Task Prompting Elicits Embeddings from Large Language Models	We introduce a new unsupervised text embedding method, Meta-Task Prompting with Explicit One-Word Limitation (MetaEOL), for generating high-quality sentence embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for model fine-tuning. Leveraging meta-task prompting, MetaEOL guides LLMs to produce embeddings through a series of carefully designed prompts that address multiple representational aspects. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that embeddings averaged from various meta-tasks are versatile embeddings that yield competitive performance on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks and excel in downstream tasks, surpassing contrastive-trained models. Our findings suggest a new scaling law, offering a versatile and resource-efficient approach for embedding generation across diverse scenarios.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.546	Yibin Lei, Di Wu, Tianyi Zhou, Tao Shen, Yu Cao, Chongyang Tao, Andrew Yates
A Sentiment Consolidation Framework for Meta-Review Generation	Modern natural language generation systems with Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit the capability to generate a plausible summary of multiple documents; however, it is uncertain if they truly possess the capability of information consolidation to generate summaries, especially on documents with opinionated information. We focus on meta-review generation, a form of sentiment summarisation for the scientific domain. To make scientific sentiment summarization more grounded, we hypothesize that human meta-reviewers follow a three-layer framework of sentiment consolidation to write meta-reviews. Based on the framework, we propose novel prompting methods for LLMs to generate meta-reviews and evaluation metrics to assess the quality of generated meta-reviews. Our framework is validated empirically as we find that prompting LLMs based on the framework — compared with prompting them with simple instructions — generates better meta-reviews.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.547	Miao Li, Jey Han Lau, Eduard Hovy
SymKGQA: Few-Shot Knowledge Graph Question Answering via Symbolic Program Generation and Execution	Semantic Parsing of natural language questions into their executable logical form (LF) has shown state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). However, these methods are not applicable for real-world applications, due to lack of KG-specific training data. Recent advances in the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led towards generating low-level LFs such as SPARQL and S-Expression in a few-shot setting. Unfortunately, these methods: (1) are limited to the knowledge of underlying LLM about the LF, (2) performs inferior for the harder complex benchmarks such as KQA Pro, (3) suffers while grounding the generated LF to a specific Knowledge Graph. Recently, a new LF called KoPL has been introduced that explicitly models complex reasoning process step-by-step in a symbolic manner and has shown SOTA on KQA Pro in fully-supervised setting. Inspired by this, we propose SymKGQA framework that generates step-by-step Symbolic LF i.e., KoPL in a few-shot in-context learning setting using LLM. Our framework is not dependent on pre-trained information of LLM about KoPL. We further build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Question-Aware Contextual KoPL (QUACK) resolver to ground the generated LF. Our experiments with different LLMs and few-shot settings demonstrate that SymKGQA outperforms all other few-shot and even many of the fully-supervised KGQA approaches.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.545	Prerna Agarwal, Nishant Kumar, Srikanta Bedathur
On the Impact of Calibration Data in Post-training Quantization and Pruning	Quantization and pruning form the foundation of compression for neural networks, enabling efficient inference for large language models (LLMs). Recently, various quantization and pruning techniques have demonstrated remarkable performance in a post-training setting. They rely upon calibration data, a small set of unlabeled examples that are used to generate layer activations. However, no prior work has systematically investigated how the calibration data impacts the effectiveness of model compression methods. In this paper, we present the first extensive empirical study on the effect of calibration data upon LLM performance. We trial a variety of quantization and pruning methods, datasets, tasks, and models. Surprisingly, we find substantial variations in downstream task performance, contrasting existing work that suggests a greater level of robustness to the calibration data. Finally, we make a series of recommendations for the effective use of calibration data in LLM quantization and pruning.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.544	Miles Williams, Nikolaos Aletras
Uni-Dubbing: Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis from Visual Articulation	In the field of speech synthesis, there is a growing emphasis on employing multimodal speech to enhance robustness. A key challenge in this area is the scarcity of datasets that pair audio with corresponding video. We employ a methodology that incorporates modality alignment during the pre-training phase on multimodal datasets, uniquely facilitating zero-shot generalization through the process of freezing the video modality feature extraction component and the encoder module within the pretrained weights, thereby enabling effective cross-modal and cross-lingual transfer. We have named this method 'Uni-Dubbing'. Our method finely tunes with both multimodal and single-modality audio data. In multimodal scenarios, it achieves a reduced word error rate (WER) of 31.73%, surpassing the previous best of 33.9%. It also excels in metrics like tone quality and synchronization. With single-modality audio, it achieves a WER of 36.08%, demonstrating adaptability to limited data. Its domain generalization capabilities are proven across various language tasks in video translation and audio generation. Trained on 433 hours of audio data, it surpasses techniques using 200 hours of audiovisual data. The code and demo are available at https://diracer.github.io/unidubbing.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.543	Songju Lei, Xize Cheng, Mengjiao Lyu, Jianqiao Hu, Jintao Tan, Runlin Liu, Lingyu Xiong, Tao Jin, Xiandong Li, Zhou Zhao
CoELM: Construction-Enhanced Language Modeling	Recent studies have shown that integrating constructional information can improve the performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in natural language understanding. However, exploration into leveraging constructional information to enhance generative language models for natural language generation has been limited. Additionally, probing studies indicate that PLMs primarily grasp the syntactic structure of constructions but struggle to capture their semantics. In this work, we encode constructions as inductive biases to explicitly embed constructional semantics and guide the generation process. We begin by presenting a construction grammar induction framework designed to automatically identify constructions from corpora. Subsequently, we propose the Construction-Enhanced Language Model (CoELM). It introduces a construction-guided language modeling approach that employs a dynamic sequence reassembly strategy during pre-training.

Predicting Text Preference Via Structured Comparative Reasoning	Comparative reasoning plays a crucial role in predicting text preferences; however, large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate inconsistencies in their reasoning, leading to incorrect preference predictions. While approaches like Chain-of-Thought improve accuracy in many settings, they struggle to consistently distinguish the similarities and differences of complex texts. We introduce SC2 , a model that prompts LLMs to predict text preferences by generating structured intermediate comparisons. SC2 begins by proposing aspects for comparison, followed by generating textual comparisons under each aspect. We select consistent comparisons with a pairwise comparator that ensures each comparison of a given aspect clearly distinguishes differences between texts, significantly reducing hallucination and improving consistency. Our empirical studies across various NLP tasks, including summarization, retrieval, and automatic rating, demonstrate that SC2 's enhanced performance in text preference prediction is significant.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.541	Jing Nathan Yan, Tianqi Liu, Justin Chiu, Jiaming Shen, Zhen Qin, Yue Yu, Charumathi Lakshmanan, Yair Kurzion, Alexander Rush, Jialu Liu, Michael Bendersky
Enhancing Noise Robustness of Retrieval-Augmented Language Models with Adaptive Adversarial Training	Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit substantial capabilities yet encounter challenges including hallucination, outdated knowledge, and untraceable reasoning processes. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution, integrating knowledge from external databases to mitigate these challenges. However, inappropriate retrieved passages can potentially hinder the LLMs' capacity to generate comprehensive and high-quality responses. Prior RAG studies on the robustness of retrieval noises often confine themselves to a limited set of noise types, deviating from real-world retrieval environments and limiting practical applicability. In this study, we initially investigate retrieval noises and categorize them into three distinct types, reflecting real-world environments. We analyze the impact of these various retrieval noises on the robustness of LLMs. Subsequently, we propose a novel RAG approach known as Retrieval-augmented Adaptive Adversarial Training (RAAT). RAAT leverages adaptive adversarial training to dynamically adjust the model's training process in response to retrieval noises. Concurrently, it employs multi-task learning to ensure the model's capacity to internally recognize noisy contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LLaMA-2 7B model trained using RAAT exhibits significant improvements in F1 and EM scores under diverse noise conditions. For reproducibility, we will release our code and data upon acceptance.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.540	Feiteng Fang, Yuelin Bai, Shiwen Ni, Min Yang, Xiaojun Chen, Ruifeng Xu
MAPO: Advancing Multilingual Reasoning through Multilingual-Alignment-as-Preference Optimization	Intuitively, reasoning abilities are considered language-agnostic. However, existing LLMs exhibit inconsistent reasoning abilities across different languages, e.g., reasoning in the dominant language like English is superior to other languages due to the imbalance of multilingual training data. To enhance reasoning abilities in non-dominant languages, we propose a Multilingual-Alignment-as-Preference Optimization framework (MAPO) to align the reasoning processes in other languages with the dominant language. Specifically, we harness an off-the-shelf translation model for the consistency between answers in non-dominant and dominant languages, which we adopt as the preference for optimization, e.g., Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Experiments show that MAPO stably achieves significant improvements in the multilingual reasoning of various models on all three benchmarks (MSVAMP +16.2%, MGSM +6.1%, and MNumGLUESub +13.3%), with improved reasoning consistency across languages. The project is available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/MAPO.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.539	Shuaijie She, Wei Zou, Shujian Huang, Wenhao Zhu, Xiang Liu, Xiang Geng, Jiajun Chen
NewsBench: A Systematic Evaluation Framework for Assessing Editorial Capabilities of Large Language Models in Chinese Journalism	We present NewsBench, a novel evaluation framework to systematically assess the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for editorial capabilities in Chinese journalism. Our constructed benchmark dataset is focused on four facets of writing proficiency and six facets of safety adherence, and it comprises manually and carefully designed 1,267 test samples in the types of multiple choice questions and short answer questions for five editorial tasks in 24 news domains. To measure performances, we propose different GPT-4 based automatic evaluation protocols to assess LLM generations for short answer questions in terms of writing proficiency and safety adherence, and both are validated by the high correlations with human evaluations. Based on the systematic evaluation framework, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of eleven popular LLMs which can handle Chinese. The experimental results highlight GPT-4 and ERNIE Bot as top performers, yet reveal a relative deficiency in journalistic safety adherence in creative writing tasks. Our findings also underscore the need for enhanced ethical guidance in machine-generated journalistic content, marking a step forward in aligning LLMs with journalistic standards and safety considerations. The evaluation framework and experimental results are expected to provide an in-depth understanding of the editorial capabilities of LLMs and speed up the development of LLMs in journalism.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.538	Miao Li, Ming-Bin Chen, Bo Tang, ShengbinHou ShengbinHou, Pengyu Wang, Haiying Deng, Zhiyu Li, Feiyu Xiong, Keming Mao, Cheng Peng, Yi Luo
POMP: Probability-driven Meta-graph Prompter for LLMs in Low-resource Unsupervised Neural Machine Translation	Low-resource languages (LRLs) face challenges in supervised neural machine translation (NMT) due to limited parallel data, prompting research in unsupervised NMT.Unsupervised NMT (UNMT), without requiring ground truth, provides solutions for LRL translations using synthetic pseudo-parallel data and parallel data from auxiliary language pairs. However, they usually encounter translation errors, including errors from synthetic data and from auxiliary language pairs with linguistic biases.We argue that large language models (LLMs) mitigate UNMT's translation errors by dynamically organizing auxiliary languages in prompts to improve LRL translations. In this paper, we propose P r O bability-driven M eta-graph P rompter (POMP), an approach employing a dynamic graph to organize multiple auxiliary languages, to prompt LLMs in LRL translations. POMP proposes a language-specific meta-graph that dynamically samples multiple translation paths to organize auxiliary languages in constructing prompts. Following the path, POMP prompts LLMs to translate with a mixture of auxiliary languages. We achieve the meta-graph's evolution by back-propagating evaluation scores to update probabilities on the graph.Our experimental improvements show POMP's effectiveness on LRLs' translation.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.537	Shilong Pan, Zhiliang Tian, Liang Ding, Haoqi Zheng, Zhen Huang, Zhihua Wen, Dongsheng Li
Dodo: Dynamic Contextual Compression for Decoder-only LMs	Transformer-based language models (LMs) are inefficient in long contexts. We propose Dodo, a solution for context compression. Instead of one vector per token in a standard transformer model, Dodo represents text with a dynamic number of hidden states at each layer, reducing the cost of self-attention to a fraction of typical time and space. Moreover, off-the-shelf models such as LLaMA can be adapted to Dodo by efficient parameter tuning methods such as LoRA. In use, Dodo can act as either an autoregressive LM or a context compressor for downstream tasks. We demonstrate through experiments in language modeling, question answering, and summarization that Dodo retains capabilities in these tasks, while drastically reducing the overhead during decoding. For example, in the autoencoding task, Dodo shrinks context at a 20x compression ratio with a BLEU score of 98% for reconstruction, achieving nearly lossless encoding.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.536	Guanghui Qin, Corby Rosset, Ethan Chau, Nikhil Rao, Benjamin Van Durme
SC2: Towards Enhancing Content Preservation and Style Consistency in Long Text Style Transfer	Text style transfer (TST) aims to vary the style polarity of text while preserving the semantic content. Although recent advancements have demonstrated remarkable progress in short TST, it remains a relatively straightforward task with limited practical applications. The more comprehensive long TST task presents two challenges: (1) existing methods encounter difficulties in accurately evaluating content attributes in multiple words, leading to content degradation; (2) the conventional vanilla style classifier loss encounters obstacles in maintaining consistent style across multiple generated sentences.In this paper, we propose a novel method SC2, where a multilayer Joint Style-Content Weighed (JSCW) module and a Style Consistency loss are designed to address the two issues. The JSCW simultaneously assesses the amounts of style and content attributes within a token, aiming to acquire a lossless content representation and thereby enhancing content preservation. The multiple JSCW layers further progressively refine content representations. We design a style consistency loss to ensure the generated multiple sentences consistently reflect the target style polarity. Moreover, we incorporate a denoising non-autoregressive decoder to accelerate the training. We conduct plentiful experiments and the results show significant improvements of SC2 over competitive baselines.

MERA: A Comprehensive LLM Evaluation in Russian	Over the past few years, one of the most notable advancements in AI research has been in foundation models (FMs), headlined by the rise of language models (LMs). However, despite researchers' attention and the rapid growth in LM application, the capabilities, limitations, and associated risks still need to be better understood. To address these issues, we introduce a new instruction benchmark, MERA, oriented towards the FMs' performance on the Russian language. The benchmark encompasses 21 evaluation tasks for generative models covering 10 skills and is supplied with private answer scoring to prevent data leakage. The paper introduces a methodology to evaluate FMs and LMs in fixed zero- and few-shot instruction settings that can be extended to other modalities. We propose an evaluation methodology, an open-source code base for the MERA assessment, and a leaderboard with a submission system. We evaluate open LMs as baselines and find they are still far behind the human level. We publicly release MERA to guide forthcoming research, anticipate groundbreaking model features, standardize the evaluation procedure, and address potential ethical concerns and drawbacks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.534	Alena Fenogenova, Artem Chervyakov, Nikita Martynov, Anastasia Kozlova, Maria Tikhonova, Albina Akhmetgareeva, Anton Emelyanov, Denis Shevelev, Pavel Lebedev, Leonid Sinev, Ulyana Isaeva, Katerina Kolomeytseva, Daniil Moskovskiy, Elizaveta Goncharova, Nikita Savushkin, Polina Mikhailova, Anastasia Minaeva, Denis Dimitrov, Alexander Panchenko, Sergey Markov
To Generate or to Retrieve? On the Effectiveness of Artificial Contexts for Medical Open-Domain Question Answering	"Medical open-domain question answering demands substantial access to specialized knowledge. Recent efforts have sought to decouple knowledge from model parameters, counteracting architectural scaling and allowing for training on common low-resource hardware. The retrieve-then-read paradigm has become ubiquitous, with model predictions grounded on relevant knowledge pieces from external repositories such as PubMed, textbooks, and UMLS. An alternative path, still under-explored but made possible by the advent of domain-specific large language models, entails constructing artificial contexts through prompting. As a result, ""to generate or to retrieve"" is the modern equivalent of Hamlet's dilemma. This paper presents MedGENIE, the first generate-then-read framework for multiple-choice question answering in medicine. We conduct extensive experiments on MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and MMLU, incorporating a practical perspective by assuming a maximum of 24GB VRAM. MedGENIE sets a new state-of-the-art in the open-book setting of each testbed, allowing a small-scale reader to outcompete zero-shot closed-book 175B baselines while using up to 706x fewer parameters. Our findings reveal that generated passages are more effective than retrieved ones in attaining higher accuracy."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.533	Giacomo Frisoni, Alessio Cocchieri, Alex Presepi, Gianluca Moro, Zaiqiao Meng
LePaRD: A Large-Scale Dataset of Judicial Citations to Precedent	We present the Legal Passage Retrieval Dataset, LePaRD. LePaRD contains millions of examples of U.S. federal judges citing precedent in context. The dataset aims to facilitate work on legal passage retrieval, a challenging practice-oriented legal retrieval and reasoning task. Legal passage retrieval seeks to predict relevant passages from precedential court decisions given the context of a legal argument. We extensively evaluate various approaches on LePaRD, and find that classification-based retrieval appears to work best. Our best models only achieve a recall of 59% when trained on data corresponding to the 10,000 most-cited passages, underscoring the difficulty of legal passage retrieval. By publishing LePaRD, we provide a large-scale and high quality resource to foster further research on legal passage retrieval. We hope that research on this practice-oriented NLP task will help expand access to justice by reducing the burden associated with legal research via computational assistance.

DetermLR: Augmenting LLM-based Logical Reasoning from Indeterminacy to Determinacy	Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the landscape of reasoning tasks. To enhance the capabilities of LLMs to emulate human reasoning, prior studies have focused on modeling reasoning steps using various thought structures like chains, trees, or graphs. However, LLM-based reasoning still encounters the following challenges: (1) Limited adaptability of preset structures to diverse tasks; (2) Insufficient precision in exploiting known conditions to derive new ones; and (3) Inadequate consideration of historical reasoning experiences for subsequent reasoning steps. To this end, we propose DetermLR, a novel perspective that rethinks the reasoning process as an evolution from indeterminacy to determinacy. First, we categorize known conditions into two types: determinate and indeterminate premises, facilitating the transformation process. Subsequently, we leverage quantitative measurements to prioritize more relevant premises to explore new insights. Furthermore, we automate the storage and extraction of available premises and reasoning paths with reasoning memory, preserving historical reasoning details for subsequent reasoning steps. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that DetermLR surpasses all baselines on various logical reasoning benchmarks: LogiQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, PrOntoQA, and LogicalDeduction. Compared to previous multi-step reasoning methods, DetermLR achieves higher accuracy with fewer reasoning steps, highlighting its superior efficiency and effectiveness in solving logical reasoning tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.531	Hongda Sun, Weikai Xu, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Bin Wang, Shuo Shang, Ji-Rong Wen, Rui Yan
BadAgent: Inserting and Activating Backdoor Attacks in LLM Agents	With the prosperity of large language models (LLMs), powerful LLM-based intelligent agents have been developed to provide customized services with a set of user-defined tools. State-of-the-art methods for constructing LLM agents adopt trained LLMs and further fine-tune them on data for the agent task. However, we show that such methods are vulnerable to our proposed backdoor attacks named BadAgent on various agent tasks, where a backdoor can be embedded by fine-tuning on the backdoor data. At test time, the attacker can manipulate the deployed LLM agents to execute harmful operations by showing the trigger in the agent input or environment. To our surprise, our proposed attack methods are extremely robust even after fine-tuning on trustworthy data. Though backdoor attacks have been studied extensively in natural language processing, to the best of our knowledge, we could be the first to study them on LLM agents that are more dangerous due to the permission to use external tools. Our work demonstrates the clear risk of constructing LLM agents based on untrusted LLMs or data.

MapGPT: Map-Guided Prompting with Adaptive Path Planning for Vision-and-Language Navigation	"Embodied agents equipped with GPT as their brain have exhibited extraordinary decision-making and generalization abilities across various tasks. However, existing zero-shot agents for vision-and-language navigation (VLN) only prompt the GPT-4 to select potential locations within localized environments, without constructing an effective ""global-view"" for the agent to understand the overall environment. In this work, we present a novel **map**-guided **GPT**-based agent, dubbed **MapGPT**, which introduces an online linguistic-formed map to encourage the global exploration. Specifically, we build an online map and incorporate it into the prompts that include node information and topological relationships, to help GPT understand the spatial environment. Benefiting from this design, we further propose an adaptive planning mechanism to assist the agent in performing multi-step path planning based on a map, systematically exploring multiple candidate nodes or sub-goals step by step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MapGPT is applicable to both GPT-4 and GPT-4V, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the R2R and REVERIE simultaneously (~10% and ~12% improvements in SR), and showcasing the newly emergent global thinking and path planning abilities of the GPT."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.529	Jiaqi Chen, Bingqian Lin, Ran Xu, Zhenhua Chai, Xiaodan Liang, Kwan-Yee Wong
Self-Modifying State Modeling for Simultaneous Machine Translation	Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) generates target outputs while receiving stream source inputs and requires a read/write policy to decide whether to wait for the next source token or generate a new target token, whose decisions form a decision path. Existing SiMT methods, which learn the policy by exploring various decision paths in training, face inherent limitations. These methods not only fail to precisely optimize the policy due to the inability to accurately assess the individual impact of each decision on SiMT performance, but also cannot sufficiently explore all potential paths because of their vast number. Besides, building decision paths requires unidirectional encoders to simulate streaming source inputs, which impairs the translation quality of SiMT models. To solve these issues, we propose Self-Modifying State Modeling (SM 2 ), a novel training paradigm for SiMT task. Without building decision paths, SM 2 individually optimizes decisions at each state during training. To precisely optimize the policy, SM 2 introduces Self-Modifying process to independently assess and adjust decisions at each state. For sufficient exploration, SM 2 proposes Prefix Sampling to efficiently traverse all potential states. Moreover, SM 2 ensures compatibility with bidirectional encoders, thus achieving higher translation quality. Experiments show that SM 2 outperforms strong baselines. Furthermore, SM 2 allows offline machine translation models to acquire SiMT ability with fine-tuning.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.528	Donglei Yu, Xiaomian Kang, Yuchen Liu, Yu Zhou, Chengqing Zong
VulLibGen: Generating Names of Vulnerability-Affected Packages via a Large Language Model	Security practitioners maintain vulnerability reports (e.g., GitHub Advisory) to help developers mitigate security risks. An important task for these databases is automatically extracting structured information mentioned in the report, e.g., the affected software packages, to accelerate the defense of the vulnerability ecosystem.However, it is challenging for existing work on affected package identification to achieve high precision. One reason is that all existing work focuses on relatively smaller models, thus they cannot harness the knowledge and semantic capabilities of large language models.To address this limitation, we propose VulLibGen, the first method to use LLM for affected package identification. In contrast to existing work, VulLibGen proposes the novel idea to directly generate the affected package. To improve the precision, VulLibGen employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT), retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and a local search algorithm. The local search algorithm is a novel post-processing algorithm we introduce for reducing the hallucination of the generated packages. Our evaluation results show that VulLibGen has an average precision of 0.806 for identifying vulnerable packages in the four most popular ecosystems in GitHub Advisory (Java, JS, Python, Go) while the best average precision in previous work is 0.721. Additionally, VulLibGen has high value to security practice: we submitted 60 <vulnerability, affected package> pairs to GitHub Advisory (covers four ecosystems) and 34 of them have been accepted and merged.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.527	Tianyu Chen, Lin Li, ZhuLiuchuan ZhuLiuchuan, Zongyang Li, Xueqing Liu, Guangtai Liang, Qianxiang Wang, Tao Xie
Robust Singing Voice Transcription Serves Synthesis	Note-level Automatic Singing Voice Transcription (AST) converts singing recordings into note sequences, facilitating the automatic annotation of singing datasets for Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) applications. Current AST methods, however, struggle with accuracy and robustness when used for practical annotation. This paper presents ROSVOT, the first robust AST model that serves SVS, incorporating a multi-scale framework that effectively captures coarse-grained note information and ensures fine-grained frame-level segmentation, coupled with an attention-based pitch decoder for reliable pitch prediction. We also established a comprehensive annotation-and-training pipeline for SVS to test the model in real-world settings. Experimental findings reveal that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art transcription accuracy with either clean or noisy inputs. Moreover, when trained on enlarged, automatically annotated datasets, the SVS model outperforms its baseline, affirming the capability for practical application.

Parrot: Enhancing Multi-Turn Instruction Following for Large Language Models	Humans often interact with large language models (LLMs) in multi-turn interaction to obtain desired answers or more information. However, most existing studies overlook the multi-turn instruction following ability of LLMs, in terms of training dataset, training method, and evaluation benchmark. In this paper, we introduce Parrot, a solution aiming to enhance multi-turn instruction following for LLMs. First, we introduce an efficient but effective method for collecting multi-turn instructions that feature human-like queries, such as anaphora and ellipsis. Second, we propose a context-aware preference optimization strategy to further enhance LLMs for complex queries in multi-turn interaction. Moreover, to quantitatively evaluate LLMs in multi-turn instruction following, we manually build a multi-turn benchmark derived from existing ones. Extensive experiments show that Parrot improves current LLMs by up to 7.2% in multi-turn instruction following. Our dataset and codes will be open-sourced to facilitate future research.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.525	Yuchong Sun, Che Liu, Kun Zhou, Jinwen Huang, Ruihua Song, Xin Zhao, Fuzheng Zhang, Di Zhang, Kun Gai
Direct Large Language Model Alignment Through Self-Rewarding Contrastive Prompt Distillation	Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human expectations without human-annotated preference data is an important problem. In this paper, we propose a method to evaluate the response preference by using the output probabilities of response pairs under contrastive prompt pairs, which could achieve better performance on LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA2-13B compared to RLAIF. Based on this, we propose an automatic alignment method, Direct Large Model Alignment (DLMA). First, we use contrastive prompt pairs to automatically generate preference data. Then, we continue to evaluate the generated preference data using contrastive prompt pairs and calculate a self-rewarding score. Finally, we use the DPO algorithm to effectively align LLMs by combining this self-rewarding score. In the experimental stage, our DLMA method could surpass the RLHF method without relying on human-annotated preference data.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.523	Aiwei Liu, Haoping Bai, Zhiyun Lu, Xiang Kong, Xiaoming Wang, Jiulong Shan, Meng Cao, Lijie Wen
Diffusion Lens: Interpreting Text Encoders in Text-to-Image Pipelines	Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I) use a latent representation of a text prompt to guide the image generation process. However, the process by which the encoder produces the text representation is unknown. We propose the Diffusion Lens, a method for analyzing the text encoder of T2I models by generating images from its intermediate representations. Using the Diffusion Lens, we perform an extensive analysis of two recent T2I models. Exploring compound prompts, we find that complex scenes describing multiple objects are composed progressively and more slowly compared to simple scenes; Exploring knowledge retrieval, we find that representation of uncommon concepts require further computation compared to common concepts, and that knowledge retrieval is gradual across layers. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the text encoder component in T2I pipelines.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.524	Michael Toker, Hadas Orgad, Mor Ventura, Dana Arad, Yonatan Belinkov
AnyGPT: Unified Multimodal LLM with Discrete Sequence Modeling	We introduce AnyGPT, an any-to-any multimodal language model that utilizes discrete representations for the unified processing of various modalities, including speech, text, images, and music. AnyGPT can be trained stably without any alterations to the current large language model (LLM) architecture or training paradigms. Instead, it relies exclusively on data-level preprocessing, facilitating the seamless integration of new modalities into LLMs, akin to the incorporation of new languages.We build a multimodal text-centric dataset for multimodal alignment pre-training. Utilizing generative models, we synthesize the first large-scale any-to-any multimodal instruction dataset. It consists of 108k samples of multi-turn conversations that intricately interweave various modalities, thus equipping the model to handle arbitrary combinations of multimodal inputs and outputs.Experimental results demonstrate that AnyGPT is capable of facilitating any-to-any multimodal conversation while achieving performance comparable to specialized models across all modalities, proving that discrete representations can effectively and conveniently unify multiple modalities within a language model.

CofiPara: A Coarse-to-fine Paradigm for Multimodal Sarcasm Target Identification with Large Multimodal Models	Social media abounds with multimodal sarcasm, and identifying sarcasm targets is particularly challenging due to the implicit incongruity not directly evident in the text and image modalities. Current methods for Multimodal Sarcasm Target Identification (MSTI) predominantly focus on superficial indicators in an end-to-end manner, overlooking the nuanced understanding of multimodal sarcasm conveyed through both the text and image. This paper proposes a versatile MSTI framework with a coarse-to-fine paradigm, by augmenting sarcasm explainability with reasoning and pre-training knowledge. Inspired by the powerful capacity of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on multimodal reasoning, we first engage LMMs to generate competing rationales for coarser-grained pre-training of a small language model on multimodal sarcasm detection. We then propose fine-tuning the model for finer-grained sarcasm target identification. Our framework is thus empowered to adeptly unveil the intricate targets within multimodal sarcasm and mitigate the negative impact posed by potential noise inherently in LMMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our model far outperforms state-of-the-art MSTI methods, and markedly exhibits explainability in deciphering sarcasm as well.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.522	Zixin Chen, Hongzhan Lin, Ziyang Luo, Mingfei Cheng, Jing Ma, Guang Chen
Beyond Recognising Entailment: Formalising Natural Language Inference from an Argumentative Perspective	In argumentation theory, argument schemes are a characterisation of stereotypical patterns of inference. There has been little work done to develop computational approaches to identify these schemes in natural language. Moreover, advancements in recognizing textual entailment lack a standardized definition of inference, which makes it challenging to compare methods trained on different datasets and rely on the generalisability of their results. In this work, we propose a rigorous approach to align entailment recognition with argumentation theory. Wagemans' Periodic Table of Arguments (PTA), a taxonomy of argument schemes, provides the appropriate framework to unify these two fields. To operationalise the theoretical model, we introduce a tool to assist humans in annotating arguments according to the PTA. Beyond providing insights into non-expert annotator training, we present Kialo-PTA24, the first multi-topic dataset for the PTA. Finally, we benchmark the performance of pre-trained language models on various aspects of argument analysis. Our experiments show that the task of argument canonicalisation poses a significant challenge for state-of-the-art models, suggesting an inability to represent argumentative reasoning and a direction for future investigation.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.520	Ameer Saadat-Yazdi, Nadin Kökciyan
Temperature-scaling surprisal estimates improve fit to human reading times – but does it do so for the “right reasons”?	A wide body of evidence shows that human language processing difficulty is predicted by the information-theoretic measure surprisal, a word's negative log probability in context. However, it is still unclear how to best estimate these probabilities needed for predicting human processing difficulty – while a long-standing belief held that models with lower perplexity would provide more accurate estimates of word predictability, and therefore lead to better reading time predictions, recent work has shown that for very large models, psycholinguistic predictive power decreases. One reason could be that language models might be more confident of their predictions than humans, because they have had exposure to several magnitudes more data. In this paper, we test what effect temperature-scaling of large language model (LLM) predictions has on surprisal estimates and their predictive power of reading times of English texts. Firstly, we show that calibration of large language models typically improves with model size, i.e. poorer calibration cannot account for poorer fit to reading times. Secondly, we find that temperature-scaling probabilities lead to a systematically better fit to reading times (up to 89% improvement in delta log likelihood), across several reading time corpora. Finally, we show that this improvement in fit is chiefly driven by words that are composed of multiple subword tokens.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.519	Tong Liu, Iza Škrjanec, Vera Demberg
Linear Transformers with Learnable Kernel Functions are Better In-Context Models	Advancing the frontier of subquadratic architectures for Language Models (LMs) is crucial in the rapidly evolving field of natural language processing. Current innovations, including State Space Models, were initially celebrated for surpassing Transformer performance on language modeling tasks. However, these models have revealed deficiencies in essential In-Context Learning capabilities – a domain where the Transformer traditionally shines. The Based model emerged as a hybrid solution, blending a Linear Transformer with a kernel inspired by the Taylor expansion of exponential functions, augmented by convolutional networks. Mirroring the Transformer's in-context adeptness, it became a strong contender in the field. In our work, we present a singular, elegant alteration to the Based kernel that amplifies its In-Context Learning abilities evaluated with the Multi-Query Associative Recall task and overall language modeling process, as demonstrated on the Pile dataset.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.518	Yaroslav Aksenov, Nikita Balagansky, Sofia Lo Cicero Vaina, Boris Shaposhnikov, Alexey Gorbatovski, Daniil Gavrilov
Synergistic Interplay between Search and Large Language Models for Information Retrieval	Information retrieval (IR) plays a crucial role in locating relevant resources from vast amounts of data, and its applications have evolved from traditional knowledge bases to modern retrieval models (RMs). The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has further revolutionized the IR field by enabling users to interact with search systems in natural languages. In this paper, we explore the advantages and disadvantages of LLMs and RMs, highlighting their respective strengths in understanding user-issued queries and retrieving up-to-date information. To leverage the benefits of both paradigms while circumventing their limitations, we propose **InteR**, a novel framework that facilitates information refinement through synergy between RMs and LLMs. InteR allows RMs to expand knowledge in queries using LLM-generated knowledge collections and enables LLMs to enhance prompt formulation using retrieved documents. This iterative refinement process augments the inputs of RMs and LLMs, leading to more accurate retrieval. Experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks involving web search and low-resource retrieval tasks show that InteR achieves overall superior **zero-shot** retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, even those using relevance judgment.

Are LLM-based Evaluators Confusing NLG Quality Criteria?	Some prior work has shown that LLMs perform well in NLG evaluation for different tasks. However, we discover that LLMs seem to confuse different evaluation criteria, which reduces their reliability. For further verification, we first consider avoiding issues of inconsistent conceptualization and vague expression in existing NLG quality criteria themselves. So we summarize a clear hierarchical classification system for 11 common aspects with corresponding different criteria from previous studies involved. Inspired by behavioral testing, we elaborately design 18 types of aspect-targeted perturbation attacks for fine-grained analysis of the evaluation behaviors of different LLMs. We also conduct human annotations beyond the guidance of the classification system to validate the impact of the perturbations. Our experimental results reveal confusion issues inherent in LLMs, as well as other noteworthy phenomena, and necessitate further research and improvements for LLM-based evaluation.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.516	Xinyu Hu, Mingqi Gao, Sen Hu, Yang Zhang, Yicheng Chen, Teng Xu, Xiaojun Wan
T-Eval: Evaluating the Tool Utilization Capability of Large Language Models Step by Step	Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on various NLP tasks and are augmented by tools for broader applications. Yet, how to evaluate and analyze the tool utilization capability of LLMs is still under-explored. In contrast to previous works that evaluate models holistically, we comprehensively decompose the tool utilization into multiple sub-processes, including instruction following, planning, reasoning, retrieval, understanding, and review. Based on that, we further introduce T-Eval to evaluate the tool-utilization capability step by step. T-Eval disentangles the tool utilization evaluation into several sub-domains along model capabilities, facilitating the inner understanding of both holistic and isolated competency of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on T-Eval and in-depth analysis of various LLMs. T-Eval not only exhibits consistency with the outcome-oriented evaluation but also provides a more fine-grained analysis of the capabilities of LLMs, providing a new perspective in LLM evaluation on tool-utilization ability. The benchmark will be available.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.515	Zehui Chen, Weihua Du, Wenwei Zhang, Kuikun Liu, Jiangning Liu, Miao Zheng, Jingming Zhuo, Songyang Zhang, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen, Feng Zhao
Fine-Grained Image-Text Alignment in Medical Imaging Enables Explainable Cyclic Image-Report Generation	Fine-grained vision-language models (VLM) have been widely used for inter-modality local alignment between the predefined fixed patches and textual words. However, in medical analysis, lesions exhibit varying sizes and positions, and using fixed patches may cause incomplete representations of lesions. Moreover, these methods provide explainability by using heatmaps to show the general image areas potentially associated with texts rather than specific regions, making their explanations not explicit and specific enough. To address these issues, we propose a novel Adaptive patch-word Matching (AdaMatch) model to correlate chest X-ray (CXR) image regions with words in medical reports and apply it to CXR-report generation to provide explainability for the generation process. AdaMatch exploits the fine-grained relation between adaptive patches and words to provide explanations of specific image regions with corresponding words. To capture the abnormal regions of varying sizes and positions, we introduce an Adaptive Patch extraction (AdaPatch) module to acquire adaptive patches for these regions adaptively. Aiming to provide explicit explainability for the CXR-report generation task, we propose an AdaMatch-based bidirectional LLM for Cyclic CXR-report generation (AdaMatch-Cyclic). It employs AdaMatch to obtain the keywords for CXR images and 'keypatches' for medical reports as hints to guide CXR-report generation. Extensive experiments on two publicly available CXR datasets validate the effectiveness of our method and its superior performance over existing methods. Source code will be released.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.514	Wenting Chen, Linlin Shen, Jingyang Lin, Jiebo Luo, Xiang Li, Yixuan Yuan
Synchronized Video Storytelling: Generating Video Narrations with Structured Storyline	Video storytelling is engaging multimedia content that utilizes video and its accompanying narration to share a story and attract the audience, where a key challenge is creating narrations for recorded visual scenes. Previous studies on dense video captioning and video story generation have made some progress. However, in practical applications, we typically require synchronized narrations for ongoing visual scenes. In this work, we introduce a new task of Synchronized Video Storytelling, which aims to generate synchronous and informative narrations for videos. These narrations, associated with each video clip, should relate to the visual content, integrate relevant knowledge, and have an appropriate word count corresponding to the clip's duration. Specifically, a structured storyline is beneficial to guide the generation process, ensuring coherence and integrity. To support the exploration of this task, we introduce a new benchmark dataset E-SyncVidStory with rich annotations. Since existing Multimodal LLMs are not effective in addressing this task in one-shot or few-shot settings, we propose a framework named VideoNarrator that can generate a storyline for input videos and simultaneously generate narrations with the guidance of the generated or predefined storyline. We further introduce a set of evaluation metrics to thoroughly assess the generation. Both automatic and human evaluations validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our dataset, codes, and evaluations will be released.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.513	Dingyi Yang, Chunru Zhan, Ziheng Wang, Biao Wang, Tiezheng Ge, Bo Zheng, Qin Jin
Improving Large Language Models in Event Relation Logical Prediction	Event relations are crucial for narrative understanding and reasoning. Governed by nuanced logic, event relation extraction (ERE) is a challenging task that demands thorough semantic understanding and rigorous logical reasoning. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth investigation to systematically explore the capability of LLMs in understanding and applying event relation logic. More in detail, we first investigate the deficiencies of LLMs in logical reasoning across different tasks. Our study reveals that LLMs are not logically consistent reasoners, which results in their suboptimal performance on tasks that need rigorous reasoning. To address this, we explore three different approaches to endow LLMs with event relation logic, and thus enable them to generate more coherent answers across various scenarios. Based on our approach, we also contribute a synthesized dataset (LLM-ERL) involving high-order reasoning for evaluation and fine-tuning. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses on different tasks also validate the effectiveness of our approach and provide insights for solving practical tasks with LLMs in future work.

Large Language Models are not Fair Evaluators	"In this paper, we uncover a positional bias in the evaluation paradigm of adopting large language models (LLMs), e.g., GPT-4, as a referee to score and compare the quality of responses generated by candidate models. We find that the quality ranking of candidate responses can be easily hacked by simply altering their order of appearance in the context. This manipulation allows us to skew the evaluation result, making one model appear considerably superior to the other, e.g., Vicuna-13B could beat ChatGPT on 66 over 80 tested queries with ChatGPT as an evaluator. We propose a simple yet effective calibration framework to address our discovered positional bias.To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we manually annotate the ""win/tie/lose"" outcomes of responses from ChatGPT and Vicuna-13B in the Vicuna Benchmark's question prompt. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach successfully alleviates evaluation bias, resulting in closer alignment with human judgments."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.511	Peiyi Wang, Lei Li, Liang Chen, Zefan Cai, Dawei Zhu, Binghuai Lin, Yunbo Cao, Lingpeng Kong, Qi Liu, Tianyu Liu, Zhifang Sui
Math-Shepherd: Verify and Reinforce LLMs Step-by-step without Human Annotations	In this paper, we present an innovative process-oriented math process reward model called Math-shepherd, which assigns a reward score to each step of math problem solutions. The training of Math-shepherd is achieved using automatically constructed process-wise supervision data, breaking the bottleneck of heavy reliance on manual annotation in existing work. We explore the effectiveness of Math-shepherd in two scenarios: 1) Verification : Math-shepherd is utilized for reranking multiple outputs generated by Large Language Models (LLMs); 2) Reinforcement Learning (RL) : Math-shepherd is employed to reinforce LLMs.With Math-shepherd, a series of open-source LLMs demonstrates exceptional performance. For instance, process RL with Math-shepherd significantly enhances Mistral-7B (77.9% → 84.1% on GSM8K and 28.6% → 33.0% on MATH).The accuracy can be further improved to 89.1% and 43.5% on two benchmarks with verification of Math-shepherd.We believe that automatic process supervision holds significant potential for the future evolution of LLMs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.510	Peiyi Wang, Lei Li, Zhihong Shao, Runxin Xu, Damai Dai, Yifei Li, Deli Chen, Yu Wu, Zhifang Sui
Whose Preferences? Differences in Fairness Preferences and Their Impact on the Fairness of AI Utilizing Human Feedback	There is a growing body of work on learning from human feedback to align various aspects of machine learning systems with human values and preferences. We consider the setting of fairness in content moderation, in which human feedback is used to determine how two comments — referencing different sensitive attribute groups — should be treated in comparison to one another. With a novel dataset collected from Prolific and MTurk, we find significant gaps in fairness preferences depending on the race, age, political stance, educational level, and LGBTQ+ identity of annotators. We also demonstrate that demographics mentioned in text have a strong influence on how users perceive individual fairness in moderation. Further, we find that differences also exist in downstream classifiers trained to predict human preferences. Finally, we observe that an ensemble, giving equal weight to classifiers trained on annotations from different demographics, performs better for different demographic intersections; compared to a single classifier that gives equal weight to each annotation.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.509	Maria Lerner, Florian Dorner, Elliott Ash, Naman Goel
Comparing Inferential Strategies of Humans and Large Language Models in Deductive Reasoning	Deductive reasoning plays a pivotal role in the formulation of sound and cohesive arguments. It allows individuals to draw conclusions that logically follow, given the truth value of the information provided. Recent progress in the domain of large language models (LLMs) has showcased their capability in executing deductive reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, a significant portion of research primarily assesses the accuracy of LLMs in solving such tasks, often overlooking a deeper analysis of their reasoning behavior. In this study, we draw upon principles from cognitive psychology to examine inferential strategies employed by LLMs, through a detailed evaluation of their responses to propositional logic problems. Our findings indicate that LLMs display reasoning patterns akin to those observed in humans, including strategies like supposition following or chain construction . Moreover, our research demonstrates that the architecture and scale of the model significantly affect its preferred method of reasoning, with more advanced models tending to adopt strategies more frequently than less sophisticated ones. Importantly, we assert that a model's accuracy, that is the correctness of its final conclusion, does not necessarily reflect the validity of its reasoning process. This distinction underscores the necessity for more nuanced evaluation procedures in the field.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.508	Philipp Mondorf, Barbara Plank
F-Eval: Asssessing Fundamental Abilities with Refined Evaluation Methods	Large language models (LLMs) garner significant attention for their unprecedented performance, leading to an increasing number of researches evaluating LLMs. However, these evaluation benchmarks are limited to assessing the instruction-following capabilities, overlooking the fundamental abilities that emerge during the pre-training stage. Previous subjective evaluation methods mainly reply on scoring by API models. However, in the absence of references, large models have shown limited ability to discern subtle differences. To bridge the gap, we propose F-Eval, a bilingual evaluation benchmark to evaluate the fundamental abilities, including expression, commonsense and logic. The tasks in F-Eval include multi-choice objective tasks, open-ended objective tasks, reference-based subjective tasks and reference-free subjective tasks. For reference-free subjective tasks, we devise new evaluation methods, serving as alternatives to scoring by API models. We conduct evaluations on 13 advanced LLMs. Results show that our evaluation methods show higher correlation coefficients and larger distinction than other evaluators. Additionally, we discuss the influence of different model sizes, dimensions, and normalization methods. We anticipate that F-Eval will facilitate the study of LLMs' fundamental abilities.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.507	Yu Sun, Keyuchen Keyuchen, Shujie Wang, Peiji Li, Qipeng Guo, Hang Yan, Xipeng Qiu, Xuanjing Huang, Dahua Lin
InterrogateLLM: Zero-Resource Hallucination Detection in LLM-Generated Answers	Despite the many advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their unprecedented rapid evolution, their impact and integration into every facet of our daily lives is limited due to various reasons. One critical factor hindering their widespread adoption is the occurrence of hallucinations, where LLMs invent answers that sound realistic, yet drift away from factual truth. In this paper, we present a novel method for detecting hallucinations in large language models, which tackles a critical issue in the adoption of these models in various real-world scenarios. Through extensive evaluations across multiple datasets and LLMs, including Llama-2, we study the hallucination levels of various recent LLMs and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method to automatically detect them. Notably, we observe up to 87% hallucinations for Llama-2 in a specific experiment, where our method achieves a Balanced Accuracy of 81%, all without relying on external knowledge.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.506	Yakir Yehuda, Itzik Malkiel, Oren Barkan, Jonathan Weill, Royi Ronen, Noam Koenigstein
SeeClick: Harnessing GUI Grounding for Advanced Visual GUI Agents	Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents are designed to automate complex tasks on digital devices, such as smartphones and desktops. Most existing GUI agents interact with the environment through extracted structured data, which can be notably lengthy (e.g., HTML) and occasionally inaccessible (e.g., on desktops). To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel visual GUI agent – SeeClick, which only relies on screenshots for task automation. In our preliminary study, we have discovered a key challenge in developing visual GUI agents: GUI grounding – the capacity to accurately locate screen elements based on instructions. To tackle this challenge, we propose to enhance SeeClick with GUI grounding pre-training and devise a method to automate the curation of GUI grounding data. Along with the efforts above, we have also created ScreenSpot, the first realistic GUI grounding benchmark that encompasses mobile, desktop, and web environments. After pre-training, SeeClick demonstrates significant improvement in ScreenSpot over various baselines. Moreover, comprehensive evaluations on three widely used benchmarks consistently support our finding that advancements in GUI grounding directly correlate with enhanced performance in downstream GUI agent tasks. The model, data and code will be open-sourced.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.505	Kanzhi Cheng, Qiushi Sun, Yougang Chu, Fangzhi Xu, Li YanTao, Jianbing Zhang, Zhiyong Wu
Semi-Supervised Spoken Language Glossification	"Spoken language glossification (SLG) aims to translate the spoken language text into the sign language gloss, i.e., a written record of sign language. In this work, we present a framework named S emi- S upervised S poken L anguage G lossification ( S3 LG) for SLG. To tackle the bottleneck of limited parallel data in SLG, our S3 LG incorporates large-scale monolingual spoken language text into SLG training. The proposed framework follows the self-training structure that iteratively annotates and learns from pseudo labels. Considering the lexical similarity and syntactic difference between sign language and spoken language, our S3 LG adopts both the rule-based heuristic and model-based approach for auto-annotation. During training, we randomly mix these complementary synthetic datasets and mark their differences with a special token. As the synthetic data may be less quality, the S3 LG further leverages consistency regularization to reduce the negative impact of noise in the synthetic data. Extensive experiments are conducted on public benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the S3 LG.

Understanding Retrieval Robustness for Retrieval-augmented Image Captioning	Recent advances in retrieval-augmented models for image captioning highlight the benefit of retrieving related captions for efficient, lightweight models with strong domain-transfer capabilities. While these models demonstrate the success of retrieval augmentation, retrieval models are still far from perfect in practice: the retrieved information can sometimes mislead the model, resulting in incorrect generation and worse performance. In this paper, we analyze the robustness of a retrieval-augmented captioning model SmallCap. Our analysis shows that the model is sensitive to tokens that appear in the majority of the retrieved captions, and the input attribution shows that those tokens are likely copied into the generated output. Given these findings, we propose to train the model by sampling retrieved captions from more diverse sets. This decreases the chance that the model learns to copy majority tokens, and improves both in-domain and cross-domain performance.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.503	Wenyan Li, Jiaang Li, Rita Ramos, Raphael Tang, Desmond Elliott
Hyperspherical Multi-Prototype with Optimal Transport for Event Argument Extraction	"Event Argument Extraction (EAE) aims to extract arguments for specified events from a text. Previous research has mainly focused on addressing long-distance dependencies of arguments, modeling co-occurrence relationships between roles and events, but overlooking potential inductive biases: (i) semantic differences among arguments of the same type and (ii) large margin separation between arguments of the different types. Inspired by prototype networks, we introduce a new model named HMPEAE, which takes the two inductive biases above as targets to locate prototypes and guide the model to learn argument representations based on these prototypes.Specifically, we set multiple prototypes to represent each role to capture intra-class differences. Simultaneously, we use hypersphere as the output space for prototypes, defining large margin separation between prototypes to encourage the model to learn significant differences between different types of arguments effectively.We solve the ""argument-prototype"" assignment as an optimal transport problem to optimize the argument representation and minimize the absolute distance between arguments and prototypes to achieve compactness within sub-clusters. Experimental results on the RAMS and WikiEvents datasets show that HMPEAE achieves state-of-the-art performances."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.502	Guangjun Zhang, Hu Zhang, YuJie Wang, Ru Li, Hongye Tan, Jiye Liang
Reward-based Input Construction for Cross-document Relation Extraction	Relation extraction (RE) is a fundamental task in natural language processing, aiming to identify relations between target entities in text. While many RE methods are designed for a single sentence or document, cross-document RE has emerged to address relations across multiple long documents. Given the nature of long documents in cross-document RE, extracting document embeddings is challenging due to the length constraints of pre-trained language models. Therefore, we propose REward-based Input Construction (REIC), the first learning-based sentence selector for cross-document RE. REIC extracts sentences based on relational evidence, enabling the RE module to effectively infer relations. Since supervision of evidence sentences is generally unavailable, we train REIC using reinforcement learning with RE prediction scores as rewards. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over heuristic methods for different RE structures and backbones in cross-document RE. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/aailabkaist/REIC.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.501	Byeonghu Na, Suhyeon Jo, Yeongmin Kim, Il-chul Moon
Multi-Aspect Controllable Text Generation with Disentangled Counterfactual Augmentation	"Multi-aspect controllable text generation aims to control the generated texts in attributes from multiple aspects (e.g., ""positive"" from sentiment and ""sport"" from topic). Existing works neglect attribute correlations formed by the intertwining of different attributes. Particularly, the stereotype formed by imbalanced attribute correlations significantly affects multi-aspect control. In this paper, we propose MAGIC, a new multi-aspect controllable text generation method with disentangled counterfactual augmentation. We alleviate the issue of imbalanced attribute correlations during training using counterfactual feature vectors in the attribute latent space by disentanglement. During inference, we enhance attribute correlations by target-guided counterfactual augmentation to further improve multi-aspect control. Experiments show that MAGIC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both imbalanced and balanced attribute correlation scenarios."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.500	Yi Liu, Xiangyu Liu, Xiangrong Zhu, Wei Hu
Focus on Your Question! Interpreting and Mitigating Toxic CoT Problems in Commonsense Reasoning	Large language models exhibit high-level commonsense reasoning abilities, especially with enhancement methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, we find these CoT-like methods lead to a considerable number of originally correct answers turning wrong, which we define as the Toxic CoT problem. To interpret and mitigate this problem, we first utilize attribution tracing and causal tracing methods to probe the internal working mechanism of the LLM during CoT reasoning. Through comparisons, we prove that the model exhibits information loss from the question over the shallow attention layers when generating rationales or answers. Based on the probing findings, we design a novel method called RIDERS (Residual decodIng and sERial-position Swap), which compensates for the information deficit in the model from both decoding and serial-position perspectives. Through extensive experiments on multiple commonsense reasoning benchmarks, we validate that this method not only significantly eliminates Toxic CoT problems (decreased by 23.6 %), but also effectively improves the model's overall commonsense reasoning performance (increased by 5.5 %).	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.499	Jiachun Li, Pengfei Cao, Chenhao Wang, Zhuoran Jin, Yubo Chen, Daojian Zeng, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao
MM-SAP: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Assessing Self-Awareness of Multimodal Large Language Models in Perception	Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in visual perception and understanding. However, these models also suffer from hallucinations, which limit their reliability as AI systems. We believe that these hallucinations are partially due to the models' struggle with understanding what they can and cannot perceive from images, a capability we refer to as self-awareness in perception. Despite its importance, this aspect of MLLMs has been overlooked in prior studies. In this paper, we aim to define and evaluate the self-awareness of MLLMs in perception. To do this, we first introduce the knowledge quadrant in perception, which helps define what MLLMs know and do not know about images. Using this framework, we propose a novel benchmark, the Self-Awareness in Perception for MLLMs (MM-SAP), specifically designed to assess this capability. We apply MM-SAP to a variety of popular MLLMs, offering a comprehensive analysis of their self-awareness and providing detailed insights. The experiment results reveal that current MLLMs possess limited self-awareness capabilities, pointing to a crucial area for future advancement in the development of trustworthy MLLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/YHWmz/MM-SAP.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.498	Yuhao Wang, Yusheng Liao, Heyang Liu, Hongcheng Liu, Yanfeng Wang, Yu Wang
Text-like Encoding of Collaborative Information in Large Language Models for Recommendation	When adapting Large Language Models for Recommendation (LLMRec), it is crucial to integrate collaborative information. Existing methods achieve this by learning collaborative embeddings in LLMs' latent space from scratch or by mapping from external models. However, they fail to represent the information in a text-like format, which may not align optimally with LLMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce BinLLM, a novel LLMRec method that seamlessly integrates collaborative information through text-like encoding. BinLLM converts collaborative embeddings from external models into binary sequences — a specific text format that LLMs can understand and operate on directly, facilitating the direct usage of collaborative information in text-like format by LLMs. Additionally, BinLLM provides options to compress the binary sequence using dot-decimal notation to avoid excessively long lengths. Extensive experiments validate that BinLLM introduces collaborative information in a manner better aligned with LLMs, resulting in enhanced performance. We release our code at https://github.com/zyang1580/BinLLM.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.497	Yang Zhang, Keqin Bao, Ming Yan, Wenjie Wang, Fuli Feng, Xiangnan He
WatME: Towards Lossless Watermarking Through Lexical Redundancy	Text watermarking has emerged as a pivotal technique for identifying machine-generated text. However, existing methods often rely on arbitrary vocabulary partitioning during decoding to embed watermarks, which compromises the availability of suitable tokens and significantly degrades the quality of responses. This study assesses the impact of watermarking on different capabilities of large language models (LLMs) from a cognitive science lens. Our finding highlights a significant disparity; knowledge recall and logical reasoning are more adversely affected than language generation. These results suggest a more profound effect of watermarking on LLMs than previously understood. To address these challenges, we introduce Watermarking with Mutual Exclusion (WatME), a novel approach leveraging linguistic prior knowledge of inherent lexical redundancy in LLM vocabularies to seamlessly integrate watermarks. Specifically, WatME dynamically optimizes token usage during the decoding process by applying a mutually exclusive rule to the identified lexical redundancies. This strategy effectively prevents the unavailability of appropriate tokens and preserves the expressive power of LLMs. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence showing that WatME effectively preserves the diverse capabilities of LLMs while ensuring watermark detectability.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.496	Liang Chen, Yatao Bian, Yang Deng, Deng Cai, Shuaiyi Li, Peilin Zhao, Kam-Fai Wong
Few-shot Transfer Learning for Knowledge Base Question Answering: Fusing Supervised Models with In-Context Learning	Existing Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) architectures are hungry for annotated data, which make them costly and time-consuming to deploy. We introduce the problem of few-shot transfer learning for KBQA, where the target domain offers only a few labeled examples, but a large labeled training dataset is available in a source domain. We propose a novel KBQA architecture called FuSIC-KBQA that performs KB-retrieval using multiple source-trained retrievers, re-ranks using an LLM and uses this as input for LLM few-shot in-context learning to generate logical forms, which are further refined using execution-guided feedback. Experiments over four source-target KBQA pairs of varying complexity show that FuSIC-KBQA significantly outperforms adaptations of SoTA KBQA models for this setting. Additional experiments in the in-domain setting show that FuSIC-KBQA also outperforms SoTA KBQA models when training data is limited.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.495	Mayur Patidar, Riya Sawhney, Avinash Singh, Biswajit Chatterjee, Mausam ., Indrajit Bhattacharya
Ex3: Automatic Novel Writing by Extracting, Excelsior and Expanding	Generating long-term texts such as novels using artificial intelligence has always been a challenge. A common approach is to use large language models (LLMs) to construct a hierarchical framework that first plans and then writes. Despite the fact that the generated novels reach a sufficient length, they exhibit poor logical coherence and appeal in their plots and deficiencies in character and event depiction, ultimately compromising the overall narrative quality. In this paper, we propose a method named Extracting Excelsior and Expanding. Ex3 initially extract structural information by learning from raw novel data. By combining this structure information with the novel data, an instruction-following dataset is meticulously crafted. This dataset is then utilized to fine-tune the LLM, aiming for excelsior generation performance. In the final stage, a tree-like expansion method is deployed to facilitate the generation of arbitrarily long novels.Evaluation against previous methods showcases Ex3's ability to produce higher-quality long-form novels.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.494	Huang Lei, Jiaming Guo, Guanhua He, Xishan Zhang, Rui Zhang, Shaohui Peng, Shaoli Liu, Tianshi Chen
Multimodal Table Understanding	Although great progress has been made by previous table understanding methods including recent approaches based on large language models (LLMs), they rely heavily on the premise that given tables must be converted into a certain text sequence (such as Markdown or HTML) to serve as model input. However, it is difficult to access such high-quality textual table representations in some real-world scenarios, and table images are much more accessible. Therefore, how to directly understand tables using intuitive visual information is a crucial and urgent challenge for developing more practical applications. In this paper, we propose a new problem, multimodal table understanding, where the model needs to generate correct responses to various table-related requests based on the given table image. To facilitate both the model training and evaluation, we construct a large-scale dataset named MMTab, which covers a wide spectrum of table images, instructions and tasks. On this basis, we develop Table-LLaVA, a generalist tabular multimodal large language model (MLLM), which significantly outperforms recent open-source MLLM baselines on 23 benchmarks under held-in and held-out settings.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.493	Mingyu Zheng, Xinwei Feng, Qingyi Si, Qiaoqiao She, Zheng Lin, Wenbin Jiang, Weiping Wang
Revisiting Demonstration Selection Strategies in In-Context Learning	Large language models (LLMs) have shown an impressive ability to perform a wide range of tasks using in-context learning (ICL), where a few examples are used to describe a task to the model. However, the performance of ICL varies significantly with the choice of demonstrations, and previous research usually focuses on the data aspect ignoring the model's effect. In this work, we first revisit the factors contributing to this variance from the model aspect, and find that the demonstration choice is both data- and model-dependent. We further propose a conjecture that the performance of a demonstration positively correlates with its contribution to the model's understanding of the test samples, and accordingly propose a data- and model-dependent demonstration selection method, TopK + ConE. Empirically, our method yields consistent improvements in both language understanding and generation tasks with different model scales. Further analyses confirm that, besides the generality and stability under different circumstances, our method provides a unified explanation for the effectiveness of previous methods.

Domain Adaptation for Subjective Induction Questions Answering on Products by Adversarial Disentangled Learning	This paper focuses on answering subjective questions about products. Different from the factoid question with a single answer span, this subjective one involves multiple viewpoints. For example, the question of 'how the phone's battery is?' not only involves facts of battery capacity but also contains users' opinions on the battery's pros and cons. A good answer should be able to integrate these heterogeneous and even inconsistent viewpoints, which is formalized as a subjective induction QA task. For this task, the data distributions are often imbalanced across different product domains. It is hard for traditional methods to work well without considering the shift of domain patterns. To address this problem, we propose a novel domain-adaptive model. Concretely, for each sample in the source and target domain, we first retrieve answer-related knowledge and represent them independently. To facilitate knowledge transferring, we then disentangle the representations into domain-invariant and domain-specific latent factors. Moreover, we develop an adversarial discriminator with contrastive learning to reduce the impact of out-of-domain bias. Based on learned latent vectors in a target domain, we yield multi-perspective summaries as inductive answers. Experiments on popular datasets show the effectiveness of our method.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.491	Yufeng Zhang, Jianxing Yu, Yanghui Rao, Libin Zheng, Qinliang Su, Huaijie Zhu, Jian Yin
Mitigating Biases for Instruction-following Language Models via Bias Neurons Elimination	Instruction-following language models often show undesirable biases. These undesirable biases may be accelerated in the real-world usage of language models, where a wide range of instructions is used through zero-shot example prompting. To solve this problem, we first define the bias neuron, which significantly affects biased outputs, and prove its existence empirically. Furthermore, we propose a novel and practical bias mitigation method, CRISPR, to eliminate bias neurons of language models in instruction-following settings. CRISPR automatically determines biased outputs and categorizes neurons that affect the biased outputs as bias neurons using an explainability method. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating biases under zero-shot instruction-following settings without losing the model's task performance and existing knowledge. The experimental results reveal the generalizability of our method as it shows robustness under various instructions and datasets. Surprisingly, our method can mitigate the bias in language models by eliminating only a few neurons (at least three).	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.490	Nakyeong Yang, Taegwan Kang, Stanley Jungkyu Choi, Honglak Lee, Kyomin Jung
M3AV: A Multimodal, Multigenre, and Multipurpose Audio-Visual Academic Lecture Dataset	Publishing open-source academic video recordings is an emergent and prevalent approach to sharing knowledge online. Such videos carry rich multimodal information including speech, the facial and body movements of the speakers, as well as the texts and pictures in the slides and possibly even the papers. Although multiple academic video datasets have been constructed and released, few of them support both multimodal content recognition and understanding tasks, which is partially due to the lack of high-quality human annotations. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal, multigenre, and multipurpose audio-visual academic lecture dataset (M 3 AV), which has almost 367 hours of videos from five sources covering computer science, mathematics, and medical and biology topics. With high-quality human annotations of the slide text and spoken words, in particular high-valued name entities, the dataset can be used for multiple audio-visual recognition and understanding tasks. Evaluations performed on contextual speech recognition, speech synthesis, and slide and script generation tasks demonstrate that the diversity of M 3 AV makes it a challenging dataset.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.489	Zhe Chen, Heyang Liu, Wenyi Yu, Guangzhi Sun, Hongcheng Liu, Ji Wu, Chao Zhang, Yu Wang, Yanfeng Wang
NaijaHate: Evaluating Hate Speech Detection on Nigerian Twitter Using Representative Data	To address the global issue of online hate, hate speech detection (HSD) systems are typically developed on datasets from the United States, thereby failing to generalize to English dialects from the Majority World. Furthermore, HSD models are often evaluated on non-representative samples, raising concerns about overestimating model performance in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce NaijaHate, the first dataset annotated for HSD which contains a representative sample of Nigerian tweets. We demonstrate that HSD evaluated on biased datasets traditionally used in the literature consistently overestimates real-world performance by at least two-fold. We then propose NaijaXLM-T, a pretrained model tailored to the Nigerian Twitter context, and establish the key role played by domain-adaptive pretraining and finetuning in maximizing HSD performance. Finally, owing to the modest performance of HSD systems in real-world conditions, we find that content moderators would need to review about ten thousand Nigerian tweets flagged as hateful daily to moderate 60% of all hateful content, highlighting the challenges of moderating hate speech at scale as social media usage continues to grow globally. Taken together, these results pave the way towards robust HSD systems and a better protection of social media users from hateful content in low-resource settings.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.488	Manuel Tonneau, Pedro Quinta De Castro, Karim Lasri, Ibrahim Farouq, Lakshmi Subramanian, Victor Orozco-Olvera, Samuel Fraiberger
Why Don’t Prompt-Based Fairness Metrics Correlate?	The widespread use of large language models has brought up essential questions about the potential biases these models might learn. This led to the development of several metrics aimed at evaluating and mitigating these biases. In this paper, we first demonstrate that prompt-based fairness metrics exhibit poor agreement, as measured by correlation, raising important questions about the reliability of fairness assessment using prompts. Then, we outline six relevant reasons why such a low correlation is observed across existing metrics. Based on these insights, we propose a method called Correlated Fairness Output (CAIRO) to enhance the correlation between fairness metrics. CAIRO augments the original prompts of a given fairness metric by using several pre-trained language models and then selects the combination of the augmented prompts that achieves the highest correlation across metrics. We show a significant improvement in Pearson correlation from 0.3 and 0.18 to 0.90 and 0.98 across metrics for gender and religion biases, respectively.

Investigating Multi-Hop Factual Shortcuts in Knowledge Editing of Large Language Models	Recent work has showcased the powerful capability of large language models (LLMs) in recalling knowledge and reasoning. However, the reliability of LLMs in combining these two capabilities into reasoning through multi-hop facts has not been widely explored. This paper systematically investigates the possibilities for LLMs to utilize shortcuts based on direct connections between the initial and terminal entities of multi-hop knowledge. We first explore the existence of factual shortcuts through Knowledge Neurons, revealing that: (i) the strength of factual shortcuts is highly correlated with the frequency of co-occurrence of initial and terminal entities in the pre-training corpora; (ii) few-shot prompting leverage more shortcuts in answering multi-hop questions compared to chain-of-thought prompting. Then, we analyze the risks posed by factual shortcuts from the perspective of multi-hop knowledge editing. Analysis shows that approximately 20% of the failures are attributed to shortcuts, and the initial and terminal entities in these failure instances usually have higher co-occurrences in the pre-training corpus. Finally, we propose erasing shortcut neurons to mitigate the associated risks and find that this approach significantly reduces failures in multiple-hop knowledge editing caused by shortcuts. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/Jometeorie/MultiHopShortcuts.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.486	Tianjie Ju, Yijin Chen, Xinwei Yuan, Zhuosheng Zhang, Wei Du, Yubin Zheng, Gongshen Liu
StreamSpeech: Simultaneous Speech-to-Speech Translation with Multi-task Learning	"Simultaneous speech-to-speech translation (Simul-S2ST, a.k.a streaming speech translation) outputs target speech while receiving streaming speech inputs, which is critical for real-time communication. Beyond accomplishing translation between speech, Simul-S2ST requires a policy to control the model to generate corresponding target speech at the opportune moment within speech inputs, thereby posing a double challenge of translation and policy. In this paper, we propose StreamSpeech, a direct Simul-S2ST model that jointly learns translation and simultaneous policy in a unified framework of multi-task learning. Adhering to a multi-task learning approach, StreamSpeech can perform offline and simultaneous speech recognition, speech translation and speech synthesis via an ""All-in-One"" seamless model. Experiments on CVSS benchmark demonstrate that StreamSpeech achieves state-of-the-art performance in both offline S2ST and Simul-S2ST tasks. Besides, StreamSpeech is able to present high-quality intermediate results (i.e., ASR or translation results) during simultaneous translation process, offering a more comprehensive real-time communication experience."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.485	Shaolei Zhang, Qingkai Fang, Shoutao Guo, Zhengrui Ma, Min Zhang, Yang Feng
ProtLLM: An Interleaved Protein-Language LLM with Protein-as-Word Pre-Training	We propose ProtLLM, a versatile cross-modal large language model (LLM) for both protein-centric and protein-language tasks. ProtLLM features a unique dynamic protein mounting mechanism, enabling it to handle complex inputs where the natural language text is interspersed with an arbitrary number of proteins. Besides, we propose the protein-as-word language modeling approach to train ProtLLM. By developing a specialized protein vocabulary, we equip the model with the capability to predict not just natural language but also proteins from a vast pool of candidates. Additionally, we construct a large-scale interleaved protein-text dataset, named InterPT, for pre-training. This dataset comprehensively encompasses both (1) structured data sources like protein annotations and (2) unstructured data sources like biological research papers, thereby endowing ProtLLM with crucial knowledge for understanding proteins. We evaluate ProtLLM on classic supervised protein-centric tasks and explore its novel protein-language applications. Experimental results demonstrate that ProtLLM not only achieves superior performance against protein-specialized baselines on protein-centric tasks but also induces zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities on protein-language tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.484	Le Zhuo, Zewen Chi, Minghao Xu, Heyan Huang, Jianan Zhao, Heqi Zheng, Conghui He, Xian-Ling Mao, Wentao Zhang
TruthX: Alleviating Hallucinations by Editing Large Language Models in Truthful Space	Large Language Models (LLMs) sometimes suffer from producing hallucinations, especially LLMs may generate untruthful responses despite knowing the correct knowledge. Activating the truthfulness within LLM is the key to fully unlocking LLM's knowledge potential. In this paper, we propose TruthX, an inference-time intervention method to activate the truthfulness of LLM by identifying and editing the features within LLM's internal representations that govern the truthfulness. TruthX employs an auto-encoder to map LLM's representations into semantic and truthful latent spaces respectively, and applies contrastive learning to identify a truthful editing direction within the truthful space. During inference, by editing LLM's internal representations in truthful space, TruthX effectively enhances the truthfulness of LLM. Experiments show that TruthX improves the truthfulness of 13 advanced LLMs by an average of 20% on TruthfulQA benchmark. Further analyses suggest that TruthX can control LLM to produce truthful or hallucinatory responses via editing only one vector in LLM's internal representations.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.483	Shaolei Zhang, Tian Yu, Yang Feng
I am a Strange Dataset: Metalinguistic Tests for Language Models	"Statements involving metalinguistic self-reference (""This paper has six sections."") are prevalent in many domains. Can large language models (LLMs) handle such language? In this paper, we present ""I am a Strange Dataset"", a new dataset for addressing this question. There are two subtasks: generation and verification. In generation, models continue statements like ""The penultimate word in this sentence is"" (where a correct continuation is ""is""). In verification, models judge the truth of statements like ""The penultimate word in this sentence is sentence."" (false). We also provide minimally different metalinguistic non-self-reference examples to complement the main dataset by probing for whether models can handle metalinguistic language at all. The dataset is hand-crafted by experts and validated by non-expert annotators. We test a variety of open-source LLMs (7B to 70B parameters) as well as closed-source LLMs through APIs. All models perform close to chance across both subtasks and even on the non-self-referential metalinguistic control data, though we find some steady improvement with model scale. GPT 4 is the only model to consistently do significantly better than chance, and it is still only in the 60% range, while our untrained human annotators score well in the 89-93% range. The dataset and evaluation toolkit are available at https://github.com/TristanThrush/i-am-a-strange-dataset"	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.482	Tristan Thrush, Jared Moore, Miguel Monares, Christopher Potts, Douwe Kiela
Defending Large Language Models Against Jailbreaking Attacks Through Goal Prioritization	While significant attention has been dedicated to exploiting weaknesses in LLMs through jailbreaking attacks, there remains a paucity of effort in defending against these attacks. We point out a pivotal factor contributing to the success of jailbreaks: the intrinsic conflict between the goals of being helpful and ensuring safety. Accordingly, we propose to integrate goal prioritization at both training and inference stages to counteract. Implementing goal prioritization during inference substantially diminishes the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of jailbreaking from 66.4% to 3.6% for ChatGPT. And integrating goal prioritization into model training reduces the ASR from 71.0% to 6.6% for Llama2-13B. Remarkably, even in scenarios where no jailbreaking samples are included during training, our approach slashes the ASR by half. Additionally, our findings reveal that while stronger LLMs face greater safety risks, they also possess a greater capacity to be steered towards defending against such attacks, both because of their stronger ability in instruction following. Our work thus contributes to the comprehension of jailbreaking attacks and defenses, and sheds light on the relationship between LLMs' capability and safety.

Decoder-only Streaming Transformer for Simultaneous Translation	Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) generates translation while reading source tokens, essentially producing the target prefix based on the source prefix. To achieve good performance, it leverages the relationship between source and target prefixes to exact a policy to guide the generation of translations. Although existing SiMT methods primarily focus on the Encoder-Decoder architecture, we explore the potential of Decoder-only architecture, owing to its superior performance in various tasks and its inherent compatibility with SiMT. However, directly applying the Decoder-only architecture to SiMT poses challenges in terms of training and inference. To alleviate the above problems, we propose the first Decoder-only SiMT model, named Decoder-only Streaming Transformer (DST). Specifically, DST separately encodes the positions of the source and target prefixes, ensuring that the position of the target prefix remains unaffected by the expansion of the source prefix. Furthermore, we propose a Streaming Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism tailored for the Decoder-only architecture. It is capable of obtaining translation policy by assessing the sufficiency of input source information and integrating with the soft-attention mechanism to generate translations. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three translation tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.480	Shoutao Guo, Shaolei Zhang, Yang Feng
MC2: Towards Transparent and Culturally-Aware NLP for Minority Languages in China	Current large language models demonstrate deficiencies in understanding low-resource languages, particularly the minority languages in China. This limitation stems from the scarcity of available pre-training data. To address this accessibility challenge, we present MC 2 , a Multilingual Corpus of Minority Languages in China, which is the largest open-source corpus of its kind so far. MC 2 includes four underrepresented languages: Tibetan, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian. Notably, we focus on the less common writing systems of Kazakh and Mongolian, i.e., Kazakh Arabic script and traditional Mongolian script, respectively, which have been long neglected in previous corpus construction efforts. Recognizing the prevalence of language contamination within existing corpora, we adopt a quality-centric solution for collecting MC 2 , prioritizing accuracy while enhancing diversity. Furthermore, we underscore the importance of attending to the multiplicity of writing systems, which is closely related to the cultural awareness of the resulting models. The MC 2 corpus and related models are made public to the community.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.479	Chen Zhang, Mingxu Tao, Quzhe Huang, Jiuheng Lin, Zhibin Chen, Yansong Feng
Mobile-Bench: An Evaluation Benchmark for LLM-based Mobile Agents	With the remarkable advancements of large language models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have become a research hotspot in human-computer interaction.However, there is a scarcity of benchmarks available for LLM-based mobile agents.Benchmarking these agents generally faces three main challenges:(1) The inefficiency of UI-only operations imposes limitations to task evaluation.(2) Specific instructions within a singular application lack adequacy for assessing the multi-dimensional reasoning and decision-making capacities of LLM mobile agents.(3) Current evaluation metrics are insufficient to accurately assess the process of sequential actions. To this end, we propose Mobile-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of LLM-based mobile agents.First, we expand conventional UI operations by incorporating 103 collected APIs to accelerate the efficiency of task completion.Subsequently, we collect evaluation data by combining real user queries with augmentation from LLMs.To better evaluate different levels of planning capabilities for mobile agents, our data is categorized into three distinct groups: SAST, SAMT, and MAMT, reflecting varying levels of task complexity. Mobile-Bench comprises 832 data entries, with more than 200 tasks specifically designed to evaluate multi-APP collaboration scenarios.Furthermore, we introduce a more accurate evaluation metric, named CheckPoint, to assess whether LLM-based mobile agents reach essential points during their planning and reasoning steps. Dataset and platform will be released in the future.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.478	Shihan Deng, Weikai Xu, Hongda Sun, Wei Liu, Tao Tan, Liujianfeng Liujianfeng, Ang Li, Jian Luan, Bin Wang, Rui Yan, Shuo Shang
On the Multi-turn Instruction Following for Conversational Web Agents	Web agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in planning and executing multi-step interactions within complex web-based environments, fulfilling a wide range of web navigation tasks. Despite these advancements, the potential for LLM-powered agents to effectively engage with sequential user instructions in real-world scenarios has not been fully explored. In this work, we introduce a new task of Conversational Web Navigation, which necessitates sophisticated interactions that span multiple turns with both the users and the environment, supported by a specially developed dataset named Multi-Turn Mind2Web (MT-Mind2Web). To tackle the limited context length of LLMs and the context-dependency issue of the conversational tasks, we further propose a novel framework, named self-reflective memory-augmented planning (Self-MAP), which employs memory utilization and self-reflection techniques. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark the MT-Mind2Web dataset, and validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.477	Yang Deng, Xuan Zhang, Wenxuan Zhang, Yifei Yuan, See-Kiong Ng, Tat-Seng Chua
ERA-CoT: Improving Chain-of-Thought through Entity Relationship Analysis	Large language models (LLMs) have achieved commendable accomplishments in various natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs still encounter significant challenges when dealing with complex scenarios involving multiple entities. These challenges arise from the presence of implicit relationships that demand multi-step reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel approach ERA-CoT, which aids LLMs in understanding context by capturing relationships between entities and supports the reasoning of diverse tasks through Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT).Experimental results show that ERA-CoT demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed method compared to current CoT prompting methods, achieving a significant improvement of an average of 5.1% on GPT3.5 compared to previous SOTA baselines. Our analysis indicates that ERA-CoT increases the LLM's understanding of entity relationships, significantly improves the accuracy of question answering, and enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.476	Yanming Liu, Xinyue Peng, Tianyu Du, Jianwei Yin, Weihao Liu, Xuhong Zhang
MetaSumPerceiver: Multimodal Multi-Document Evidence Summarization for Fact-Checking	Fact-checking real-world claims often requires reviewing multiple multimodal documents in order to assess the claim's truthfulness, a highly laborious and time-consuming task. In this paper, we present a summarization model crafted to generate claim-specific summaries useful for fact-checking from multimodal multi-document datasets. The model takes inputs in the form of documents, images, and a claim, with the objective of assisting in fact-checking tasks. We introduce a dynamic perceiver-based model that is able to handle inputs from multiple modalities of arbitrary lengths. To train our model, we leverage a novel reinforcement learning-based entailment objective in order to generate summaries that provide evidence distinguishing between different truthfulness labels. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we conduct experiments on both an existing benchmark as well as a new dataset of multi-document claims which we contribute. Our approach outperforms the SOTA approach by 4.6% in the claim verification task on the MOCHEG dataset and demonstrates strong performance on our new Multi-News-Fact-Checking dataset.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.474	Ting-Chih Chen, Chia-Wei Tang, Chris Thomas
Enhancing Dialogue State Tracking Models through LLM-backed User-Agents Simulation	Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is designed to monitor the evolving dialogue state in the conversations and plays a pivotal role in developing task-oriented dialogue systems. However, obtaining the annotated data for the DST task is usually a costly endeavor. In this paper, we focus on employing LLMs to generate dialogue data to reduce dialogue collection and annotation costs. Specifically, GPT-4 is used to simulate the user and agent interaction, generating thousands of dialogues annotated with DST labels. Then a two-stage fine-tuning on LLaMA 2 is performed on the generated data and the real data for the DST prediction. Experimental results on two public DST benchmarks show that with the generated dialogue data, our model performs better than the baseline trained solely on real data. In addition, our approach is also capable of adapting to the dynamic demands in real-world scenarios, generating dialogues in new domains swiftly. After replacing dialogue segments in any domain with the corresponding generated ones, the model achieves comparable performance to the model trained on real data. The source code and generated dialogue data are available at https://github.com/ParticleMedia/LUAS.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.473	Cheng Niu, Xingguang Wang, Xuxin Cheng, Juntong Song, Tong Zhang
Faithful Chart Summarization with ChaTS-Pi	Chart-to-summary generation can help explore data, communicate insights, and help the visually impaired people. Multi-modal generative models have been used to produce fluent summaries, but they can suffer from factual and perceptual errors. In this work we present CHATS-CRITIC, a reference-free chart summarization metric for scoring faithfulness. CHATS-CRITIC is composed of an image-to-text model to recover the table from a chart, and a tabular entailment model applied to score the summary sentence by sentence. We find that CHATS-CRITIC evaluates the summary quality according to human ratings better than reference-based metrics, either learned or n-gram based, and can be further used to fix candidate summaries by removing not supported sentences. We then introduce CHATS-PI, a chart-to-summary pipeline that leverages CHATS-CRITIC during inference to fix and rank sampled candidates from any chart-summarization model. We evaluate CHATS-PI and CHATS-CRITIC using human raters, establishing state-of-the-art results on two popular chart-to-summary datasets.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.472	Syrine Krichene, Francesco Piccinno, Fangyu Liu, Julian Eisenschlos
Large Language Models as Zero-shot Dialogue State Tracker through Function Calling	Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent in conversational systems due to their advanced understanding and generative capabilities in general contexts. However, their effectiveness in task-oriented dialogues (TOD), which requires not only response generation but also effective dialogue state tracking (DST) within specific tasks and domains, remains less satisfying. In this work, we propose a novel approach FnCTOD for solving DST with LLMs through function calling. This method improves zero-shot DST, allowing adaptation to diverse domains without extensive data collection or model tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves exceptional performance with both modestly sized open-source and also proprietary LLMs: with in-context prompting it enables various 7B or 13B parameter models to surpass the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) achieved by ChatGPT, and improves ChatGPT's performance beating the SOTA by 5.6% average joint goal accuracy (JGA). Individual model results for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are boosted by 4.8% and 14%, respectively. We also show that by fine-tuning on a small collection of diverse task-oriented dialogues, we can equip modestly sized models, specifically a 13B parameter LLaMA2-Chat model, with function-calling capabilities and DST performance comparable to ChatGPT while maintaining their chat capabilities. We have made the code publicly available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/FnCTOD.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.471	Zekun Li, Zhiyu Chen, Mike Ross, Patrick Huber, Seungwhan Moon, Zhaojiang Lin, Xin Dong, Adithya Sagar, Xifeng Yan, Paul Crook
RAVEL: Evaluating Interpretability Methods on Disentangling Language Model Representations	Individual neurons participate in the representation of multiple high-level concepts. To what extent can different interpretability methods successfully disentangle these roles? To help address this question, we introduce RAVEL (Resolving Attribute-Value Entanglements in Language Models), a dataset that enables tightly controlled, quantitative comparisons between a variety of existing interpretability methods. We use the resulting conceptual framework to define the new method of Multi-task Distributed Alignment Search (MDAS), which allows us to find distributed representations satisfying multiple causal criteria. With Llama2-7B as the target language model, MDAS achieves state-of-the-art results on RAVEL, demonstrating the importance of going beyond neuron-level analyses to identify features distributed across activations.

Towards Real-World Writing Assistance: A Chinese Character Checking Benchmark with Faked and Misspelled Characters	Writing assistance aims to improve the correctness and quality of input texts, with character checking being crucial in detecting and correcting wrong characters. In the real world where handwriting occupies the vast majority, characters that humans get wrong include faked characters (i.e., untrue characters created due to writing errors) and misspelled characters (i.e., true characters used incorrectly due to spelling errors). However, existing datasets and related studies only focus on misspelled characters that can be represented by computer text encoding systems, thereby ignoring faked characters which are more common and difficult. To break through this dilemma, we present Visual-C 3 , a human-annotated Visual C hinese C haracter C hecking dataset with faked and misspelled Chinese characters. To the best of our knowledge, Visual-C 3 is the first real-world visual and the largest human-crafted dataset for the Chinese character checking scenario. Additionally, we also propose and evaluate novel baseline methods on Visual-C 3 . Extensive empirical results and analyses show that Visual-C 3 is high-quality yet challenging. As the first study focusing on Chinese faked characters, the dataset and the baseline methods are publicly available at https://github.com/THUKElab/Visual-C3.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.469	Yinghui Li, Zishan Xu, Shaoshen Chen, Haojing Huang, Yangning Li, Shirong Ma, Yong Jiang, Zhongli Li, Qingyu Zhou, Hai-Tao Zheng, Ying Shen
Arithmetic Control of LLMs for Diverse User Preferences: Directional Preference Alignment with Multi-Objective Rewards	Fine-grained control over large language models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge, hindering their adaptability to diverse user needs. While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) shows promise in aligning LLMs, its reliance on scalar rewards often limits its ability to capture diverse user preferences in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we introduce the Directional Preference Alignment (DPA) framework. Unlike the scalar-reward RLHF, DPA incorporates multi-objective reward modeling to represent diverse preference profiles. Additionally, DPA models user preferences as directions (i.e., unit vectors) in the reward space to achieve user-dependent preference control. Our method involves training a multi-objective reward model and then fine-tuning the LLM with a preference-conditioned variant of Rejection Sampling Finetuning (RSF), an RLHF method adopted by Llama 2. This method enjoys a better performance trade-off across various reward objectives. In comparison with the scalar-reward RLHF, DPA offers users intuitive control over LLM generation: they can arithmetically specify their desired trade-offs (e.g., more helpfulness with less verbosity). We also validate the effectiveness of DPA with real-world alignment experiments on Mistral-7B. Our method provides straightforward arithmetic control over the trade-off between helpfulness and verbosity while maintaining competitive performance with strong baselines such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.468	Haoxiang Wang, Yong Lin, Wei Xiong, Rui Yang, Shizhe Diao, Shuang Qiu, Han Zhao, Tong Zhang
Towards Privacy-Aware Sign Language Translation at Scale	A major impediment to the advancement of sign language translation (SLT) is data scarcity. Much of the sign language data currently available on the web cannot be used for training supervised models due to the lack of aligned captions. Furthermore, scaling SLT using large-scale web-scraped datasets bears privacy risks due to the presence of biometric information, which the responsible development of SLT technologies should account for. In this work, we propose a two-stage framework for privacy-aware SLT at scale that addresses both of these issues. We introduce SSVP-SLT, which leverages self-supervised video pretraining on anonymized and unannotated videos, followed by supervised SLT finetuning on a curated parallel dataset. SSVP-SLT achieves state-of-the-art finetuned and zero-shot gloss-free SLT performance on the How2Sign dataset, outperforming the strongest respective baselines by over 3 BLEU-4. Based on controlled experiments, we further discuss the advantages and limitations of self-supervised pretraining and anonymization via facial obfuscation for SLT.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.467	Phillip Rust, Bowen Shi, Skyler Wang, Necati Cihan Camgoz, Jean Maillard
OpenToM: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Theory-of-Mind Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models	Neural Theory-of-Mind (N-ToM), machine's ability to understand and keep track of the mental states of others, is pivotal in developing socially intelligent agents. However, prevalent N-ToM benchmarks have several shortcomings, including the presence of ambiguous and artificial narratives, absence of personality traits and preferences, a lack of questions addressing characters' psychological mental states, and limited diversity in the questions posed. In response to these issues, we construct OpenToM, a new benchmark for assessing N-ToM with (1) longer and clearer narrative stories, (2) characters with explicit personality traits, (3) actions that are triggered by character intentions, and (4) questions designed to challenge LLMs' capabilities of modeling characters' mental states of both the physical and psychological world. Using OpenToM, we reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs thrive at modeling certain aspects of mental states in the physical world but fall short when tracking characters' mental states in the psychological world.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.466	Hainiu Xu, Runcong Zhao, Lixing Zhu, Jinhua Du, Yulan He
Parallel Structures in Pre-training Data Yield In-Context Learning	Pre-trained language models (LMs) are capable of in-context learning (ICL): they can adapt to a task with only a few examples given in the prompt without any parameter update. However, it is unclear where this capability comes from as there is a stark distribution shift between pre-training text and ICL prompts. In this work, we study what patterns of the pre-training data contribute to ICL. We find that LMs' ICL ability depends on parallel structures in the pre-training data—pairs of phrases following similar templates in the same context window. Specifically, we detect parallel structures by checking whether training on one phrase improves prediction of the other, and conduct ablation experiments to study their effect on ICL. We show that removing parallel structures in the pre-training data reduces LMs' ICL accuracy by 51 % (vs 2% from random ablation). This drop persists even when excluding common patterns such as n-gram repetitions and long-range dependency, showing the diversity and generality of parallel structures. A closer look at the detected parallel structures indicates that they cover diverse linguistic tasks and span long distances in the data.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.465	Yanda Chen, Chen Zhao, Zhou Yu, Kathleen McKeown, He He
Bypassing LLM Watermarks with Color-Aware Substitutions	"Watermarking approaches are proposed to identify if text being circulated is human- or large language model- (LLM) generated. The state-of-the-art watermarking strategy of Kirchenbauer et al. (2023a) biases the LLM to generate specific (""green"") tokens. However, determining the robustness of this watermarking method under finite (low) edit budgets is an open problem. Additionally, existing attack methods failto evade detection for longer text segments. We overcome these limitations, and propose Self Color Testing-based Substitution (SCTS), thefirst ""color-aware"" attack. SCTS obtains color information by strategically prompting the watermarked LLM and comparing output tokensfrequencies. It uses this information to determine token colors, and substitutes green tokens with non-green ones. In our experiments, SCTS successfully evades watermark detection using fewer number of edits than related work. Additionally, we show both theoretically and empirically that SCTS can remove the watermark for arbitrarily long watermarked text."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.464	Qilong Wu, Varun Chandrasekaran
DocLLM: A Layout-Aware Generative Language Model for Multimodal Document Understanding	Enterprise documents such as forms, receipts, reports, and other such records, often carry rich semantics at the intersection of textual and spatial modalities. The visual cues offered by their complex layouts play a crucial role in comprehending these documents effectively. In this paper, we present DocLLM, a lightweight extension to traditional large language models (LLMs) for reasoning over visual documents, taking into account both textual semantics and spatial layout. Our model differs from existing multimodal LLMs by avoiding expensive image encoders and focuses exclusively on bounding box information to incorporate the spatial layout structure. Specifically, the cross-alignment between text and spatial modalities is captured by decomposing the attention mechanism in classical transformers to a set of disentangled matrices. Furthermore, we devise a pre-training objective that learns to infill text segments. This approach allows us to address irregular layouts and heterogeneous content frequently encountered in visual documents. The pre-trained model is fine-tuned using a large-scale instruction dataset, covering four core document intelligence tasks. We demonstrate that our solution outperforms SotA LLMs on 14 out of 16 datasets across all tasks, and generalizes well to 4 out of 5 previously unseen datasets.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.463	Dongsheng Wang, Natraj Raman, Mathieu Sibue, Zhiqiang Ma, Petr Babkin, Simerjot Kaur, Yulong Pei, Armineh Nourbakhsh, Xiaomo Liu
Speech language models lack important brain-relevant semantics	Despite known differences between reading and listening in the brain, recent work has shown that text-based language models predict both text-evoked and speech-evoked brain activity to an impressive degree. This poses the question of what types of information language models truly predict in the brain. We investigate this question via a direct approach, in which we systematically remove specific low-level stimulus features (textual, speech, and visual) from language model representations to assess their impact on alignment with fMRI brain recordings during reading and listening. Comparing these findings with speech-based language models reveals starkly different effects of low-level features on brain alignment. While text-based models show reduced alignment in early sensory regions post-removal, they retain significant predictive power in late language regions. In contrast, speech-based models maintain strong alignment in early auditory regions even after feature removal but lose all predictive power in late language regions. These results suggest that speech-based models provide insights into additional information processed by early auditory regions, but caution is needed when using them to model processing in late language regions. We make our code publicly available. [https://github.com/subbareddy248/speech-llm-brain]	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.462	Subba Reddy Oota, Emin Çelik, Fatma Deniz, Mariya Toneva
Safety Alignment in NLP Tasks: Weakly Aligned Summarization as an In-Context Attack	Recent developments in balancing the usefulness and safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised a critical question: Are mainstream NLP tasks adequately aligned with safety consideration? Our study, focusing on safety-sensitive documents obtained through adversarial attacks, reveals significant disparities in the safety alignment of various NLP tasks. For instance, LLMs can effectively summarize malicious long documents but often refuse to translate them. This discrepancy highlights a previously unidentified vulnerability: attacks exploiting tasks with weaker safety alignment, like summarization, can potentially compromise the integrity of tasks traditionally deemed more robust, such as translation and question-answering (QA). Moreover, the concurrent use of multiple NLP tasks with lesser safety alignment increases the risk of LLMs inadvertently processing harmful content. We demonstrate these vulnerabilities in various safety-aligned LLMs, particularly Llama2 models, Gemini and GPT-4, indicating an urgent need for strengthening safety alignments across a broad spectrum of NLP tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.461	Yu Fu, Yufei Li, Wen Xiao, Cong Liu, Yue Dong
BvSP: Broad-view Soft Prompting for Few-Shot Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction	Aspect sentiment quad prediction (ASQP) aims to predict four aspect-based elements, including aspect term, opinion term, aspect category, and sentiment polarity. In practice, unseen aspects, due to distinct data distribution, impose many challenges for a trained neural model. Motivated by this, this work formulates ASQP into the few-shot scenario, which aims for fast adaptation in real applications. Therefore, we first construct a few-shot ASQP dataset (FSQP) that contains richer categories and is more balanced for the few-shot study. Moreover, recent methods extract quads through a generation paradigm, which involves converting the input sentence into a templated target sequence. However, they primarily focus on the utilization of a single template or the consideration of different template orders, thereby overlooking the correlations among various templates. To tackle this issue, we further propose a Broad-view Soft Prompting (BvSP) method that aggregates multiple templates with a broader view by taking into account the correlation between the different templates. Specifically, BvSP uses the pre-trained language model to select the most relevant k templates with Jensen–Shannon divergence. BvSP further introduces soft prompts to guide the pre-trained language model using the selected templates. Then, we aggregate the results of multi-templates by voting mechanism. Empirical results demonstrate that BvSP significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under four few-shot settings and other public datasets. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/byinhao/BvSP.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.460	Yinhao Bai, Yalan Xie, Xiaoyi Liu, Yuhua Zhao, Zhixin Han, Mengting Hu, Hang Gao, Renhong Cheng
FactPICO: Factuality Evaluation for Plain Language Summarization of Medical Evidence	Plain language summarization with LLMs can be useful for improving textual accessibility of technical content. But how factual are these summaries in a high-stakes domain like medicine? This paper presents FactPICO, a factuality benchmark for plain language summarization of medical texts describing randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which are the basis of evidence-based medicine and can directly inform patient treatment. FactPICO consists of 345 plain language summaries of RCT abstracts generated from three LLMs (i.e., GPT-4, Llama-2, and Alpaca), with fine-grained evaluation and natural language rationales from experts. We assess the factuality of critical elements of RCTs in those summaries: Populations, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes (PICO), as well as the reported findings concerning these. We also evaluate the correctness of the extra information (e.g., explanations) added by LLMs. Using FactPICO, we benchmark a range of existing factuality metrics, including the newly devised ones based on LLMs. We find that plain language summarization of medical evidence is still challenging, especially when balancing between simplicity and factuality, and that existing metrics correlate poorly with expert judgments on the instance level.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.459	Sebastian Joseph, Lily Chen, Jan Trienes, Hannah Göke, Monika Coers, Wei Xu, Byron Wallace, Junyi Jessy Li
Competition of Mechanisms: Tracing How Language Models Handle Facts and Counterfactuals	Interpretability research aims to bridge the gap between the empirical success and our scientific understanding of the inner workings of large language models (LLMs). However, most existing research in this area focused on analyzing a single mechanism, such as how models copy or recall factual knowledge. In this work, we propose the formulation of competition of mechanisms, which instead of individual mechanisms focuses on the interplay of multiple mechanisms, and traces how one of them becomes dominant in the final prediction. We uncover how and where the competition of mechanisms happens within LLMs using two interpretability methods, logit inspection and attention modification. Our findings show traces of the mechanisms and their competition across various model components, and reveal attention positions that effectively control the strength of certain mechanisms.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.458	Francesco Ortu, Zhijing Jin, Diego Doimo, Mrinmaya Sachan, Alberto Cazzaniga, Bernhard Schölkopf
Machine Unlearning of Pre-trained Large Language Models	This study investigates the concept of the 'right to be forgotten' within the context of large language models (LLMs). We explore machine unlearning as a pivotal solution, with a focus on pre-trained models–a notably under-researched area. Our research delineates a comprehensive framework for machine unlearning in pre-trained LLMs, encompassing a critical analysis of seven diverse unlearning methods. Through rigorous evaluation using curated datasets from arXiv, books, and GitHub, we establish a robust benchmark for unlearning performance, demonstrating that these methods are over 105 times more computationally efficient than retraining. Our results show that integrating gradient ascent with gradient descent on in-distribution data improves hyperparameter robustness. We also provide detailed guidelines for efficient hyperparameter tuning in the unlearning process. Our findings advance the discourse on ethical AI practices, offering substantive insights into the mechanics of machine unlearning for pre-trained LLMs and underscoring the potential for responsible AI development.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.457	Jin Yao, Eli Chien, Minxin Du, Xinyao Niu, Tianhao Wang, Zezhou Cheng, Xiang Yue
Label-Efficient Model Selection for Text Generation	Model selection for a given target task can be costly, as it may entail extensive annotation of the quality of outputs of different models. We introduce DiffUse, an efficient method to make an informed decision between candidate text generation models based on preference annotations. DiffUse reduces the required amount of annotations, thus saving valuable time and resources in performing evaluation.DiffUse intelligently selects instances by clustering embeddings that represent the semantic differences between model outputs. Thus, it is able to identify a subset of examples that are more informative for preference decisions. Our method is model-agnostic, and can be applied to any text generation model for selecting between models, prompts and configurations. Moreover, we propose a practical iterative approach for dynamically determining how many instances to annotate. In a series of experiments over hundreds of model pairs, we demonstrate that DiffUse can dramatically reduce the required number of annotations – by up to 75% – while maintaining high evaluation reliability.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.456	Shir Ashury Tahan, Ariel Gera, Benjamin Sznajder, Leshem Choshen, Liat Ein-Dor, Eyal Shnarch
Inducing Systematicity in Transformers by Attending to Structurally Quantized Embeddings	Transformers generalize to novel compositions of structures and entities after being trained on a complex dataset, but easily overfit on datasets of insufficient complexity. We observe that when the training set is sufficiently complex, the model encodes structurally equivalent sentences using a systematic attention pattern. Inspired by this observation, we propose SQ-Transformer (Structurally Quantized) that explicitly encourages systematicity in the embeddings and attention layers even with low-complexity data. At the embedding level, we introduce Structure-oriented Vector Quantization (SoVQ) to cluster word embeddings into several classes of structurally equivalent entities. At the attention level, we devise the Systematic Attention Layer (SAL) and an alternative, Systematically Regularized Layer (SRL) that operate on the quantized word embeddings so that sentences of the same structure are encoded with invariant or similar attention patterns. Empirically, we show SQ-Transformer achieves stronger compositional generalization than the vanilla Transformer on multiple low-complexity semantic parsing and machine translation datasets. In our analysis, we show SoVQ indeed learns a syntactically clustered embedding space, and SAL/SRL induces generalizable attention patterns, altogether leading to improved systematicity.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.455	Yichen Jiang, Xiang Zhou, Mohit Bansal
Deciphering Hate: Identifying Hateful Memes and Their Targets	Internet memes have become a powerful means for individuals to express emotions, thoughts, and perspectives on social media. While often considered as a source of humor and entertainment, memes can also disseminate hateful content targeting individuals or communities. Most existing research focuses on the negative aspects of memes in high-resource languages, overlooking the distinctive challenges associated with low-resource languages like Bengali (also known as Bangla). Furthermore, while previous work on Bengali memes has focused on detecting hateful memes, there has been no work on detecting their targeted entities. To bridge this gap and facilitate research in this arena, we introduce a novel multimodal dataset for Bengali, BHM (Bengali Hateful Memes). The dataset consists of 7,148 memes with Bengali as well as code-mixed captions, tailored for two tasks: (i) detecting hateful memes, and (ii) detecting the social entities they target (i.e., Individual, Organization, Community, and Society). To solve these tasks, we propose DORA (Dual cO-attention fRAmework), a multimodal deep neural network that systematically extracts the significant modality features from the memes and jointly evaluates them with the modality-specific features to understand the context better. Our experiments show that DORA is generalizable on other low-resource hateful meme datasets and outperforms several state-of-the-art rivaling baselines.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.454	Eftekhar Hossain, Omar Sharif, Mohammed Moshiul Hoque, Sarah Masud Preum
Direct Metric Optimization for Image Captioning through Reward-Weighted Augmented Data Utilization	While image captioning is an essential field of vision language models (VLM), a lack of continuity between the learning objective and final performance metrics of VLMs complicates their training and optimization. Reinforcement learning (RL) can directly optimize such metrics, but it is accompanied by a significant computational cost, making it difficult to apply to recent large-scale VLMs. In this paper, we propose Direct Metric Optimization (DMO), which is a lightweight final-metric-optimizing training method. We replace the computationally expensive exploration process in RL with an offline, diverse text data augmentation and show that self-supervised training on reward-weighted augmented data leads to direct and stable metric optimization. Our experiments demonstrate that DMO achieves performance comparable to those of the state-of-the-art RL method while saving hundreds of times more model forwarding iterations and greater amounts of computation time. This suggests that DMO constitutes a promising alternative for metric optimization in the era of large-scale VLMs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.453	Takumi Takada, Yuma Suzuki, Hiroki Takushima, Hayato Tanoue, Haruki Sato, Aiswariya Kumar, Hiroki Nishihara, Takayuki Hori, Kazuya Ueki
BizBench: A Quantitative Reasoning Benchmark for Business and Finance	Answering questions within business and finance requires reasoning, precision, and a wide-breadth of technical knowledge. Together, these requirements make this domain difficult for large language models (LLMs). We introduce BizBench, a benchmark for evaluating models' ability to reason about realistic financial problems. BizBench comprises eight quantitative reasoning tasks, focusing on question-answering (QA) over financial data via program synthesis. We include three financially-themed code-generation tasks from newly collected and augmented QA data. Additionally, we isolate the reasoning capabilities required for financial QA: reading comprehension of financial text and tables for extracting intermediate values, and understanding financial concepts and formulas needed to calculate complex solutions. Collectively, these tasks evaluate a model's financial background knowledge, ability to parse financial documents, and capacity to solve problems with code. We conduct an in-depth evaluation of open-source and commercial LLMs, comparing and contrasting the behavior of code-focused and language-focused models. We demonstrate that the current bottleneck in performance is due to LLMs' limited business and financial understanding, highlighting the value of a challenging benchmark for quantitative reasoning within this domain.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.452	Michael Krumdick, Rik Koncel-Kedziorski, Viet Lai, Varshini Reddy, Charles Lovering, Chris Tanner
Think Twice: Perspective-Taking Improves Large Language Models’ Theory-of-Mind Capabilities	"Human interactions are deeply rooted in the interplay of thoughts, beliefs, and desires made possible by Theory of Mind (ToM): our cognitive ability to understand the mental states of ourselves and others. Although ToM may come naturally to us, emulating it presents a challenge to even the most advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent improvements to LLMs' reasoning capabilities from simple yet effective prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have seen limited applicability to ToM. In this paper, we turn to the prominent cognitive science theory ""Simulation Theory"" to bridge this gap. We introduce SimToM, a novel two-stage prompting framework inspired by Simulation Theory's notion of perspective-taking. To implement this idea on current ToM benchmarks, SimToM first filters context based on what the character in question knows before answering a question about their mental state. Our approach, which requires no additional training and minimal prompt-tuning, shows substantial improvement over existing methods, and our analysis reveals the importance of perspective-taking to Theory-of-Mind capabilities. Our findings suggest perspective-taking as a promising direction for future research into improving LLMs' ToM capabilities."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.451	Alex Wilf, Sihyun Lee, Paul Pu Liang, Louis-Philippe Morency
A Modular Approach for Multimodal Summarization of TV Shows	In this paper we address the task of summarizing television shows, which touches key areas in AI research: complex reasoning, multiple modalities, and long narratives. We present a modular approach where separate components perform specialized sub-tasks which we argue affords greater flexibility compared to end-to-end methods. Our modules involve detecting scene boundaries, reordering scenes so as to minimize the number of cuts between different events, converting visual information to text, summarizing the dialogue in each scene, and fusing the scene summaries into a final summary for the entire episode. We also present a new metric, PRISMA (**P**recision and **R**ecall Evaluat**i**on of **s**ummary F**a**cts), to measure both precision and recall of generated summaries, which we decompose into atomic facts. Tested on the recently released SummScreen3D dataset (Papalampidi & Lapata, 2023), our method produces higher quality summaries than comparison models, as measured with ROUGE and our new fact-based metric.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.450	Louis Mahon, Mirella Lapata
Hard Prompts Made Interpretable: Sparse Entropy Regularization for Prompt Tuning with RL	With the advent of foundation models, prompt tuning has positioned itself as an important technique for directing model behaviors and eliciting desired responses. Prompt tuning regards selecting appropriate keywords included into the input, thereby adapting to the downstream task without adjusting or fine-tuning the model parameters. There is a wide range of work in prompt tuning, from approaches that directly harness the backpropagated gradient signals from the model, to those employing black-box optimization such as reinforcement learning (RL) methods. Our primary focus is on RLPrompt, which aims to find optimal prompt tokens leveraging soft Q-learning. While the results show promise, we have observed that the prompts frequently appear unnatural, which impedes their interpretability. We address this limitation by using sparse Tsallis entropy regularization, a principled approach to filtering out unlikely tokens from consideration. We extensively evaluate our approach across various tasks, including few-shot text classification, unsupervised text style transfer, and textual inversion from images. The results indicate a notable improvement over baselines, highlighting the efficacy of our approach in addressing the challenges of prompt tuning. Moreover, we show that the prompts discovered using our method are more natural and interpretable compared to those from other baselines.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.449	Yunseon Choi, Sangmin Bae, Seonghyun Ban, Minchan Jeong, Chuheng Zhang, Lei Song, Li Zhao, Jiang Bian, Kee-Eung Kim
Label-Synchronous Neural Transducer for E2E Simultaneous Speech Translation	While the neural transducer is popular for online speech recognition, simultaneous speech translation (SST) requires both streaming and re-ordering capabilities. This paper presents the LS-Transducer-SST, a label-synchronous neural transducer for SST, which naturally possesses these two properties. The LS-Transducer-SST dynamically decides when to emit translation tokens based on an Auto-regressive Integrate-and-Fire (AIF) mechanism. A latency-controllable AIF is also proposed, which can control the quality-latency trade-off either only during decoding, or it can be used in both decoding and training. The LS-Transducer-SST can naturally utilise monolingual text-only data via its prediction network which helps alleviate the key issue of data sparsity for E2E SST. During decoding, a chunk-based incremental joint decoding technique is designed to refine and expand the search space. Experiments on the Fisher-CallHome Spanish (Es-En) and MuST-C En-De data show that the LS-Transducer-SST gives a better quality-latency trade-off than existing popular methods. For example, the LS-Transducer-SST gives a 3.1/2.9 point BLEU increase (Es-En/En-De) relative to CAAT at a similar latency and a 1.4 s reduction in average lagging latency with similar BLEU scores relative to Wait-k.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.448	Keqi Deng, Phil Woodland
Long Context is Not Long at All: A Prospector of Long-Dependency Data for Large Language Models	Long-context modeling capabilities are important for large language models (LLMs) in various applications. However, directly training LLMs with long context windows is insufficient to enhance this capability since some training samples do not exhibit strong semantic dependencies across long contexts.In this study, we propose a data mining framework ProLong that can assign each training sample with a long dependency score, which can be used to rank and filter samples that are more advantageous for enhancing long-context modeling abilities in LLM training. Specifically, we first use delta perplexity scores to measure the Dependency Strength between text segments in a given document. Then, we refine this metric based on the Dependency Distance of these segments to incorporate spatial relationships across long contexts. Final results are calibrated with a Dependency Specificity metric to prevent trivial dependencies introduced by repetitive patterns. Moreover, a random sampling approach is proposed to optimize the computational efficiency of ProLong. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks indicate that ProLong effectively identifies documents that carry long dependencies, and LLMs trained on these documents exhibit significantly enhanced long-context modeling capabilities.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.447	Longze Chen, Ziqiang Liu, Wanwei He, Yinhe Zheng, Hao Sun, Yunshui Li, Run Luo, Min Yang
M3CoT: A Novel Benchmark for Multi-Domain Multi-step Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought	Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) requires models to leverage knowledge from both textual and visual modalities for step-by-step reasoning, which gains increasing attention. Nevertheless, the current MCoT benchmark still faces some challenges: (1) absence of visual modal reasoning, (2) single-step visual modal reasoning, and (3) domain missing, thereby hindering the development of MCoT. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel benchmark (M 3 CoT) to address the above challenges, advancing the multi-domain, multi-step, and multi-modal CoT. Additionally, we conduct a thorough evaluation involving abundant MCoT approaches on Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). In addition, we highlight that the current VLLMs still struggle to correctly reason in M 3 CoT and there is a large gap between VLLMs and human performance in M 3 CoT, despite their superior results on previous MCoT benchmarks. To our knowledge, we take the first meaningful step toward the multi-domain, multi-step, and multi-modal scenario in MCoT. We hope that M 3 CoT will serve as a valuable resource, providing a pioneering foundation in multi-domain, multi-step, multi-modal chain-of-thought research.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.446	Qiguang Chen, Libo Qin, Jin Zhang, Zhi Chen, Xiao Xu, Wanxiang Che
Full Parameter Fine-tuning for Large Language Models with Limited Resources	Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) but demand massive GPU resources for training. Lowering the threshold for LLMs training would encourage greater participation from researchers, benefiting both academia and society. While existing approaches have focused on parameter-efficient fine-tuning, which tunes or adds a small number of parameters, few have addressed the challenge of tuning the full parameters of LLMs with limited resources. In this work, we propose a new optimizer, LOw-Memory Optimization (LOMO), which fuses the gradient computation and the parameter update in one step to reduce memory usage. By integrating LOMO with existing memory saving techniques, we reduce memory usage to 10.8% compared to the standard approach (DeepSpeed solution). Consequently, our approach enables the full parameter fine-tuning of a 65B model on a single machine with 8 × RTX 3090, each with 24GB memory.

Revealing the Parametric Knowledge of Language Models: A Unified Framework for Attribution Methods	Language Models (LMs) acquire parametric knowledge from their training process, embedding it within their weights. The increasing scalability of LMs, however, poses significant challenges for understanding a model's inner workings and further for updating or correcting this embedded knowledge without the significant cost of retraining. This underscores the importance of unveiling exactly what knowledge is stored and its association with specific model components. Instance Attribution (IA) and Neuron Attribution (NA) offer insights into this training-acquired knowledge, though they have not been compared systematically. Our study introduces a novel evaluation framework to quantify and compare the knowledge revealed by IA and NA. To align the results of the methods we introduce the attribution method NA-Instances to apply NA for retrieving influential training instances, and IA-Neurons to discover important neurons of influential instances discovered by IA. We further propose a comprehensive list of faithfulness tests to evaluate the comprehensiveness and sufficiency of the explanations provided by both methods. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that NA generally reveals more diverse and comprehensive information regarding the LM's parametric knowledge compared to IA. Nevertheless, IA provides unique and valuable insights into the LM's parametric knowledge, which are not revealed by NA. Our findings further suggest the potential of a synergistic approach of combining the diverse findings of IA and NA for a more holistic understanding of an LM's parametric knowledge.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.444	Haeun Yu, Pepa Atanasova, Isabelle Augenstein
Aligning Large Language Models for Controllable Recommendations	Inspired by the exceptional general intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have begun to explore their application in pioneering the next generation of recommender systems — systems that are conversational, explainable, and controllable. However, existing literature primarily concentrates on integrating domain-specific knowledge into LLMs to enhance accuracy using a fixed task template, often overlooking the diversity of recommendation tasks and the ability of LLMs to follow recommendation-specific instructions. To address this gap, we first introduce a collection of supervised learning tasks, augmented with labels derived from a conventional recommender model, aimed at explicitly improving LLMs' proficiency in adhering to recommendation-specific instructions. Next, we propose a reinforcement learning-based alignment procedure to enhance LLMs' generalization ability. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the capability of LLMs to respond to instructions within recommender systems, reducing formatting errors while maintaining a high level of accuracy.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.443	Wensheng Lu, Jianxun Lian, Wei Zhang, Guanghua Li, Mingyang Zhou, Hao Liao, Xing Xie
ANAH: Analytical Annotation of Hallucinations in Large Language Models	Reducing the hallucination problem of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for their wide applications. A comprehensive and fine-grained measurement of the hallucination is the first key step for the governance of this issue but is under-explored in the community.Thus, we present ANAH, a bilingual dataset that offers AN alytical A nnotation of H allucinations in LLMs within Generative Question Answering.Each answer sentence in our dataset undergoes rigorous annotation, involving the retrieval of a reference fragment, the judgment of the hallucination type, and the correction of hallucinated content. ANAH consists of ~12k sentence-level annotations for ~4.3k LLM responses covering over 700 topics, constructed by a human-in-the-loop pipeline.Thanks to the fine granularity of the hallucination annotations, we can quantitatively confirm that the hallucinations of LLMs progressively accumulate in the answer and use ANAH to train and evaluate hallucination annotators. We conduct extensive experiments on studying generative and discriminative annotators and show that, although current open-source LLMs have difficulties in fine-grained hallucination annotation, the generative annotator trained with ANAH can surpass all open-source LLMs and GPT-3.5, obtain performance competitive with GPT-4, and exhibits better generalization ability on unseen questions.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.442	Ziwei Ji, Yuzhe Gu, Wenwei Zhang, Chengqi Lyu, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen
Acquiring Clean Language Models from Backdoor Poisoned Datasets by Downscaling Frequency Space	Despite the notable success of language models (LMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, the reliability of LMs is susceptible to backdoor attacks. Prior research attempts to mitigate backdoor learning while training the LMs on the poisoned dataset, yet struggles against complex backdoor attacks in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the learning mechanisms of backdoor LMs in the frequency space by Fourier analysis. Our findings indicate that the backdoor mapping presented on the poisoned datasets exhibits a more discernible inclination towards lower frequency compared to clean mapping, resulting in the faster convergence of backdoor mapping. To alleviate this dilemma, we propose Multi-Scale Low-Rank Adaptation (MuScleLoRA), which deploys multiple radial scalings in the frequency space with low-rank adaptation to the target model and further aligns the gradients when updating parameters. Through downscaling in the frequency space, MuScleLoRA encourages the model to prioritize the learning of relatively high-frequency clean mapping, consequently mitigating backdoor learning. Experimental results demonstrate that MuScleLoRA outperforms baselines significantly. Notably, MuScleLoRA reduces the average success rate of diverse backdoor attacks to below 15% across multiple datasets and generalizes to various backbone LMs, including BERT, RoBERTa, and Llama2. The codes are publicly available at Anonymous.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.441	Zongru Wu, Zhuosheng Zhang, Pengzhou Cheng, Gongshen Liu
Efficient OCR for Building a Diverse Digital History	Many users consult digital archives daily, but the information they can access is unrepresentative of the diversity of documentary history. The sequence-to-sequence architecture typically used for optical character recognition (OCR) – which jointly learns a vision and language model – is poorly extensible to low-resource document collections, as learning a language-vision model requires extensive labeled sequences and compute. This study models OCR as a character level image retrieval problem, using a contrastively trained vision encoder. Because the model only learns characters' visual features, it is more sample efficient and extensible than existing architectures, enabling accurate OCR in settings where existing solutions fail. Crucially, it opens new avenues for community engagement in making digital history more representative of documentary history.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.440	Jacob Carlson, Tom Bryan, Melissa Dell
MemeGuard: An LLM and VLM-based Framework for Advancing Content Moderation via Meme Intervention	In the digital world, memes present a unique challenge for content moderation due to their potential to spread harmful content. Although detection methods have improved, proactive solutions such as intervention are still limited, with current research focusing mostly on text-based content, neglecting the widespread influence of multimodal content like memes. Addressing this gap, we present MemeGuard, a comprehensive framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) for meme intervention. MemeGuard harnesses a specially fine-tuned VLM, VLMeme, for meme interpretation, and a multimodal knowledge selection and ranking mechanism (MKS) for distilling relevant knowledge. This knowledge is then employed by a general-purpose LLM to generate contextually appropriate interventions. Another key contribution of this work is the Intervening Cyberbullying in Multimodal Memes (ICMM) dataset, a high-quality, labeled dataset featuring toxic memes and their corresponding human-annotated interventions. We leverage ICMM to test MemeGuard, demonstrating its proficiency in generating relevant and effective responses to toxic memes. red Disclaimer: This paper contains harmful content that may be disturbing to some readers.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.439	Prince Jha, Raghav Jain, Konika Mandal, Aman Chadha, Sriparna Saha, Pushpak Bhattacharyya
PokeMQA: Programmable knowledge editing for Multi-hop Question Answering	Multi-hop question answering (MQA) is one of the challenging tasks to evaluate machine's comprehension and reasoning abilities, where large language models (LLMs) have widely achieved the human-comparable performance. Due to the dynamics of knowledge facts in real world, knowledge editing has been explored to update model with the up-to-date facts while avoiding expensive re-training or fine-tuning. Starting from the edited fact, the updated model needs to provide cascading changes in the chain of MQA. The previous art simply adopts a mix-up prompt to instruct LLMs conducting multiple reasoning tasks sequentially, including question decomposition, answer generation, and conflict checking via comparing with edited facts. However, the coupling of these functionally-diverse reasoning tasks inhibits LLMs' advantages in comprehending and answering questions while disturbing them with the unskilled task of conflict checking. We thus propose a framework, Programmable knowledge editing for Multi-hop Question Answering (PokeMQA), to decouple the jobs. Specifically, we prompt LLMs to decompose knowledge-augmented multi-hop question, while interacting with a detached trainable scope detector to modulate LLMs behavior depending on external conflict signal. The experiments on three LLM backbones and two benchmark datasets validate our superiority in knowledge editing of MQA, outperforming all competitors by a large margin in almost all settings and consistently producing reliable reasoning process.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.438	Hengrui Gu, Kaixiong Zhou, Xiaotian Han, Ninghao Liu, Ruobing Wang, Xin Wang
Moûsai: Efficient Text-to-Music Diffusion Models	"Recent years have seen the rapid development of large generative models for text; however, much less research has explored the connection between text and another ""language"" of communication – music. Music, much like text, can convey emotions, stories, and ideas, and has its own unique structure and syntax. In our work, we bridge text and music via a text-to-music generation model that is highly efficient, expressive, and can handle long-term structure. Specifically, we develop Moûsai, a cascading two-stage latent diffusion model that can generate multiple minutes of high-quality stereo music at 48kHz from textual descriptions. Moreover, our model features high efficiency, which enables real-time inference on a single consumer GPU with a reasonable speed. Through experiments and property analyses, we show our model's competence over a variety of criteria compared with existing music generation models. Lastly, to promote the open-source culture, we provide a collection of open-source libraries with the hope of facilitating future work in the field. We open-source the following: Codes: https://github.com/archinetai/audio-diffusion-pytorch. Music samples for this paper: http://bit.ly/44ozWDH.

To be Continuous, or to be Discrete, Those are Bits of Questions	Recently, binary representation has been proposed as a novel representation that lies between continuous and discrete representations. It exhibits considerable information-preserving capability when being used to replace continuous input vectors. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of further introducing it to the output side, aiming to allow models to output binary labels instead. To preserve the structural information on the output side along with label information, we extend the previous contrastive hashing method as structured contrastive hashing. More specifically, we upgrade CKY from label-level to bit-level, define a new similarity function with span marginal probabilities, and introduce a novel contrastive loss function with a carefully designed instance selection strategy. Our model achieves competitive performance on various structured prediction tasks, and demonstrates that binary representation can be considered a novel representation that further bridges the gap between the continuous nature of deep learning and the discrete intrinsic property of natural languages.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.436	Yiran Wang, Masao Utiyama
Speech Sense Disambiguation: Tackling Homophone Ambiguity in End-to-End Speech Translation	End-to-end speech translation (ST) presents notable disambiguation challenges as it necessitates simultaneous cross-modal and cross-lingual transformations. While word sense disambiguation is an extensively investigated topic in textual machine translation, the exploration of disambiguation strategies for ST models remains limited. Addressing this gap, this paper introduces the concept of speech sense disambiguation (SSD), specifically emphasizing homophones - words pronounced identically but with different meanings. To facilitate this, we first create a comprehensive homophone dictionary and an annotated dataset rich with homophone information established based on speech-text alignment. Building on this unique dictionary, we introduce AmbigST, an innovative homophone-aware contrastive learning approach that integrates a homophone-aware masking strategy. Our experiments on different MuST-C and CoVoST ST benchmarks demonstrate that AmbigST sets new performance standards. Specifically, it achieves SOTA results on BLEU scores for English to German, Spanish, and French ST tasks, underlining its effectiveness in reducing speech sense ambiguity.

LEMON: Reviving Stronger and Smaller LMs from Larger LMs with Linear Parameter Fusion	In the new era of language models, small models (with billions of parameter sizes) are receiving increasing attention due to their flexibility and cost-effectiveness in deployment. However, limited by the model size, the performance of small models trained from scratch may often be unsatisfactory. Learning a stronger and smaller model with the help of larger models is an intuitive idea. Inspired by the observing modular structures in preliminary analysis, we propose LEMON to learn competent initial points for smaller models by fusing parameters from larger models, thereby laying a solid foundation for subsequent training. Specifically, the parameter fusion process involves two operators for layer and dimension, respectively, and we also introduce controllable receptive fields to model the prior parameter characteristics. In this way, the larger model could be transformed into any specific smaller scale and architecture. Starting from LLaMA 2-7B, we revive two stronger and smaller models with 1.3B and 2.7B. Experimental results demonstrate that the fusion-based method exhibits flexibility and outperforms a series of competitive baselines in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.434	Yilong Chen, Junyuan Shang, Zhenyu Zhang, Shiyao Cui, Tingwen Liu, Shuohuan Wang, Yu Sun, Hua Wu
LLMEmbed: Rethinking Lightweight LLM’s Genuine Function in Text Classification	With the booming of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt-learning has become a promising method mainly researched in various research areas. Recently, many attempts based on prompt-learning have been made to improve the performance of text classification. However, most of these methods are based on heuristic Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and tend to be more complex but less efficient. In this paper, we rethink the LLM-based text classification methodology, propose a simple and effective transfer learning strategy, namely LLMEmbed, to address this classical but challenging task. To illustrate, we first study how to properly extract and fuse the text embeddings via various lightweight LLMs at different network depths to improve their robustness and discrimination, then adapt such embeddings to train the classifier. We perform extensive experiments on publicly available datasets, and the results show that LLMEmbed achieves strong performance while enjoys low training overhead using lightweight LLM backbones compared to recent methods based on larger LLMs, *i.e.* GPT-3, and sophisticated prompt-based strategies. Our LLMEmbed achieves adequate accuracy on publicly available benchmarks without any fine-tuning while merely use 4% model parameters, 1.8% electricity consumption and 1.5% runtime compared to its counterparts. Code is available at: https://github.com/ChunLiu-cs/LLMEmbed-ACL2024.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.433	ChunLiu ChunLiu, Hongguang Zhang, Kainan Zhao, Xinghai Ju, Lin Yang
Chain-of-Exemplar: Enhancing Distractor Generation for Multimodal Educational Question Generation	Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are important in enhancing concept learning and student engagement for educational purposes. Despite the multimodal nature of educational content, current methods focus mainly on text-based inputs and often neglect the integration of visual information. In this work, we study the problem of multimodal educational question generation, which aims at generating subject-specific educational questions with plausible yet incorrect distractors based on multimodal educational content. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel framework, named Chain-of-Exemplar (CoE), which utilizes multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with Chain-of-Thought reasoning to improve the generation of challenging distractors. Furthermore, CoE leverages three-stage contextualized exemplar retrieval to retrieve exemplary questions as guides for generating more subject-specific educational questions. Experimental results on the ScienceQA benchmark demonstrate the superiority of CoE in both question generation and distractor generation over existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.432	Haohao Luo, Yang Deng, Ying Shen, See-Kiong Ng, Tat-Seng Chua
Dataflow-Guided Retrieval Augmentation for Repository-Level Code Completion	Recent years have witnessed the deployment of code language models (LMs) in various code intelligence tasks such as code completion. Yet, it is challenging for pre-trained LMs to generate correct completions in private repositories. Previous studies retrieve cross-file context based on import relations or text similarity, which is insufficiently relevant to completion targets. In this paper, we propose a dataflow-guided retrieval augmentation approach, called DraCo, for repository-level code completion. DraCo parses a private repository into code entities and establishes their relations through an extended dataflow analysis, forming a repo-specific context graph. Whenever triggering code completion, DraCo precisely retrieves relevant background knowledge from the repo-specific context graph and generates well-formed prompts to query code LMs. Furthermore, we construct a large Python dataset, ReccEval, with more diverse completion targets. Our experiments demonstrate the superior accuracy and applicable efficiency of DraCo, improving code exact match by 3.43% and identifier F1-score by 3.27% on average compared to the state-of-the-art approach.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.431	Wei Cheng, Yuhan Wu, Wei Hu
Context-aware Difference Distilling for Multi-change Captioning	Multi-change captioning aims to describe complex and coupled changes within an image pair in natural language. Compared with single-change captioning, this task requires the model to have higher-level cognition ability to reason an arbitrary number of changes. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware difference distilling (CARD) network to capture all genuine changes for yielding sentences. Given an image pair, CARD first decouples context features that aggregate all similar/dissimilar semantics, termed common/difference context features. Then, the consistency and independence constraints are designed to guarantee the alignment/discrepancy of common/difference context features. Further, the common context features guide the model to mine locally unchanged features, which are subtracted from the pair to distill locally difference features. Next, the difference context features augment the locally difference features to ensure that all changes are distilled. In this way, we obtain an omni-representation of all changes, which is translated into linguistic sentences by a transformer decoder. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show CARD performs favourably against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/tuyunbin/CARD.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.430	Yunbin Tu, Liang Li, Li Su, Zheng-Jun Zha, Chenggang Yan, Qingming Huang
NACL: A General and Effective KV Cache Eviction Framework for LLM at Inference Time	Large Language Models (LLMs) have ignited an innovative surge of AI applications, marking a new era of exciting possibilities equipped with extended context windows. However, hosting these models is cost-prohibitive mainly due to the extensive memory consumption of KV Cache involving long-context modeling. Despite several works proposing to evict unnecessary tokens from the KV Cache, most of them rely on the biased local statistics of accumulated attention scores and report performance using unconvincing metric like perplexity on inadequate short-text evaluation. In this paper, we propose NACL, a general framework for long-context KV cache eviction that achieves more optimal and efficient eviction in a single operation during the encoding phase. Due to NACL's efficiency, we combine more accurate attention score statistics in Proxy-Tokens Eviction with the diversified random eviction strategy of Random Eviction, aiming to alleviate the issue of attention bias and enhance the robustness in maintaining pivotal tokens for long-context modeling tasks. Notably, our method significantly improves the performance on short- and long-text tasks by 80% and 76% respectively, reducing KV Cache by up to 5× with over 95% performance maintenance.

SpikeVoice: High-Quality Text-to-Speech Via Efficient Spiking Neural Network	"Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Network (SNN) has demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency in vision, natural language, and speech understanding tasks, indicating their capacity to ""see"", ""listen"", and ""read"". In this paper, we design SpikeVoice, which performs high-quality Text-To-Speech (TTS) via SNN, to explore the potential of SNN to ""speak"". A major obstacle to using SNN for such generative tasks lies in the demand for models to grasp long-term dependencies. The serial nature of spiking neurons, however, leads to the invisibility of information at future spiking time steps, limiting SNN models to capture sequence dependencies solely within the same time step. We term this phenomenon ""partial-time dependency"". To address this issue, we introduce Spiking Temporal-Sequential Attention (STSA) in the SpikeVoice. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeVoice is the first TTS work in the SNN field. We perform experiments using four well-established datasets that cover both Chinese and English languages, encompassing scenarios with both single-speaker and multi-speaker configurations. The results demonstrate that SpikeVoice can achieve results comparable to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with only 10.5% energy consumption of ANN. Both our demo and code are available as supplementary material."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.429	Kexin Wang, Jiahong Zhang, Yong Ren, Man Yao, Di Shang, Bo Xu, Guoqi Li
Analysing The Impact of Sequence Composition on Language Model Pre-Training	Most language model pre-training frameworks concatenate multiple documents into fixed-length sequences and use causal masking to compute the likelihood of each token given its context; this strategy is widely adopted due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, to this day, the influence of the pre-training sequence composition strategy on the generalisation properties of the model remains under-explored.In this work, we find that applying causal masking can lead to the inclusion of distracting information from previous documents during pre-training, which negatively impacts the performance of the models on language modelling and downstream tasks. In intra-document causal masking, the likelihood of each token is only conditioned on the previous tokens in the same document, eliminating potential distracting information from previous documents and significantly improving performance. Furthermore, we find that concatenating related documents can reduce some potential distractions during pre-training, and our proposed efficient retrieval-based sequence construction method, Bm25Chunk, can improve in-context learning (+11.6%), knowledge memorisation (+9.8%), and context utilisation (+7.2%) abilities of language models without sacrificing efficiency.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.427	Yu Zhao, Yuanbin Qu, Konrad Staniszewski, Szymon Tworkowski, Wei Liu, Piotr Miłoś, Yuxiang Wu, Pasquale Minervini
STRUCTSUM Generation for Faster Text Comprehension	We consider the task of generating structured representations of text using large language models (LLMs). We focus on tables and mind maps as representative modalities. Tables are more organized way of representing data, while mind maps provide a visually dynamic and flexible approach, particularly suitable for sparse content. Despite the effectiveness of LLMs on different tasks, we show that current models struggle with generating structured outputs. In response, we present effective prompting strategies for both of these tasks. We introduce a taxonomy of problems around factuality, global and local structure, common to both modalities and propose a set of critiques to tackle these issues resulting in an absolute improvement in accuracy of +37 pp (79%) for mind maps and +15 pp (78%) for tables. To evaluate semantic coverage of generated structured representations we propose Auto-QA, and we verify the adequacy of Auto-QA using SQuAD dataset. We further evaluate the usefulness of structured representations via a text comprehension user study. The results show a significant reduction in comprehension time compared to text when using table (42.9%) and mind map (31.9%), without loss in accuracy.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.426	Parag Jain, Andreea Marzoca, Francesco Piccinno
Synthesizing Text-to-SQL Data from Weak and Strong LLMs	The capability gap between open-source and closed-source large language models (LLMs) remains a challenge in text-to-SQL tasks. In this paper, we introduce a synthetic data approach that combines data produced by larger, more powerful models (strong models) with error information data generated by smaller, not well-aligned models (weak models). The method not only enhances the domain generalization of text-to-SQL models but also explores the potential of error data supervision through preference learning. Furthermore, we employ the synthetic data approach for instruction tuning on open-source LLMs, resulting SENSE, a specialized text-to-SQL model. The effectiveness of SENSE is demonstrated through state-of-the-art results on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks, bridging the performance gap between open-source models and methods prompted by closed-source models.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.425	Jiaxi Yang, Binyuan Hui, Min Yang, Jian Yang, Junyang Lin, Chang Zhou
PlatoLM: Teaching LLMs in Multi-Round Dialogue via a User Simulator	The unparalleled performance of closed-sourced ChatGPT has sparked efforts towards its democratization, with notable strides made by leveraging real user and ChatGPT dialogues, as evidenced by Vicuna. However, due to challenges in gathering dialogues involving human participation, current endeavors like Baize and UltraChat rely on ChatGPT conducting roleplay to simulate humans based on instructions, resulting in overdependence on seeds, diminished human-likeness, limited topic diversity, and an absence of genuine multi-round conversational dynamics. To address the above issues, we propose a paradigm to simulate human behavior better and explore the benefits of incorporating more human-like questions in multi-turn conversations. Specifically, we directly target human questions extracted from genuine human-machine conversations as a learning goal and provide a novel user simulator called 'Socratic'. The experimental results show our response model, 'PlatoLM', achieves SoTA performance among LLaMA-based 7B models in MT-Bench. Our findings further demonstrate that our method introduces highly human-like questioning patterns and rich topic structures, which can teach the response model better than previous works in multi-round conversations.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.424	Chuyi Kong, Yaxin Fan, Xiang Wan, Feng Jiang, Benyou Wang
Large Language Models are Superpositions of All Characters: Attaining Arbitrary Role-play via Self-Alignment	Considerable efforts have been invested in augmenting the role-playing proficiency of open-source large language models (LLMs) by emulating proprietary counterparts. Nevertheless, we posit that LLMs inherently harbor role-play capabilities, owing to the extensive knowledge of characters and potential dialogues ingrained in their vast training corpora. Thus, we introduce Ditto, the first self-alignment method for role-play, which encourages an instruction-following LLM to simulate role-play dialogues as a variant of reading comprehension, and creates a role-play training set comprising 4000 characters, surpassing the scale of currently available datasets by tenfold regarding the number of roles. Subsequently, we fine-tune the LLM using this self-generated dataset to augment its role-playing capabilities. Upon evaluating our meticulously constructed role-play benchmark and the roleplay subset of MT-Bench, Ditto, in various parameter scales, consistently maintains a consistent role identity and provides accurate role-specific knowledge in multi-turn role-play conversations, outperforming all open-source role-play baselines. Furthermore, we present the first cross-supervision role-play experiment, revealing that the role-play styles can be easily acquired, while the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs confine the knowledge within role-play.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.423	Keming Lu, Bowen Yu, Chang Zhou, Jingren Zhou
Text Embedding Inversion Security for Multilingual Language Models	Textual data is often represented as real-numbered embeddings in NLP, particularly with the popularity of large language models (LLMs) and Embeddings as a Service (EaaS). However, storing sensitive information as embeddings can be susceptible to security breaches, as research shows that text can be reconstructed from embeddings, even without knowledge of the underlying model. While defence mechanisms have been explored, these are exclusively focused on English, leaving other languages potentially exposed to attacks. This work explores LLM security through multilingual embedding inversion. We define the problem of black-box multilingual and crosslingual inversion attacks, and explore their potential implications. Our findings suggest that multilingual LLMs may be more vulnerable to inversion attacks, in part because English-based defences may be ineffective. To alleviate this, we propose a simple masking defense effective for both monolingual and multilingual models. This study is the first to investigate multilingual inversion attacks, shedding light on the differences in attacks and defenses across monolingual and multilingual settings.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.422	Yiyi Chen, Heather Lent, Johannes Bjerva
Order-Agnostic Data Augmentation for Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition	Data augmentation (DA) methods have been proven to be effective for pre-trained language models (PLMs) in low-resource settings, including few-shot named entity recognition (NER). However, existing NER DA techniques either perform rule-based manipulations on words that break the semantic coherence of the sentence, or exploit generative models for entity or context substitution, which requires a substantial amount of labeled data and contradicts the objective of operating in low-resource settings. In this work, we propose order-agnostic data augmentation (OaDA), an alternative solution that exploits the often overlooked order-agnostic property in the training data construction phase of sequence-to-sequence NER methods for data augmentation. To effectively utilize the augmented data without suffering from the one-to-many issue, where multiple augmented target sequences exist for one single sentence, we further propose the use of ordering instructions and an innovative OaDA-XE loss. Specifically, by treating each permutation of entity types as an ordering instruction, we rearrange the entity set accordingly, ensuring a distinct input-output pair, while OaDA-XE assigns loss based on the best match between the target sequence and model predictions. We conduct comprehensive experiments and analyses across three major NER benchmarks and significantly enhance the few-shot capabilities of PLMs with OaDA.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.421	Huiming Wang, Liying Cheng, Wenxuan Zhang, De Wen Soh, Lidong Bing
EXAMS-V: A Multi-Discipline Multilingual Multimodal Exam Benchmark for Evaluating Vision Language Models	We introduce EXAMS-V, a new challenging multi-discipline multimodal multilingual exam benchmark for evaluating vision language models. It consists of 20,932 multiple-choice questions across 20 school disciplines covering natural science, social science, and other miscellaneous studies, e.g., religion, fine arts, business, etc. EXAMS-V includes a variety of multimodal features such as text, images, tables, figures, diagrams, maps, scientific symbols, and equations. The questions come in 11 languages from 7 language families. Unlike existing benchmarks, EXAMS-V is uniquely curated by gathering school exam questions from various countries, with a variety of education systems. This distinctive approach calls for intricate reasoning across diverse languages and relies on region-specific knowledge. Solving the problems in the dataset requires advanced perception and joint reasoning over the text and the visual content in the image. Our evaluation results demonstrate that this is a challenging dataset, which is difficult even for advanced vision–text models such as GPT-4V and Gemini; this underscores the inherent complexity of the dataset and its significance as a future benchmark.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.420	Rocktim Das, Simeon Hristov, Haonan Li, Dimitar Dimitrov, Ivan Koychev, Preslav Nakov
MARS: Meaning-Aware Response Scoring for Uncertainty Estimation in Generative LLMs	Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely utilized for their excellence in various tasks. However, their tendency to produce inaccurate or misleading outputs poses a potential risk, particularly in high-stakes environments. Therefore, estimating the correctness of generative LLM outputs is an important task for enhanced reliability. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) in generative LLMs is an evolving domain, where SOTA probability-based methods commonly employ length-normalized scoring. In this work, we propose Meaning-Aware Response Scoring (MARS) as an alternative to length-normalized scoring for UE methods. MARS is a novel scoring function that considers the semantic contribution of each token in the generated sequence in the context of the question. We demonstrate that integrating MARS into UE methods results in a universal and significant improvement in UE performance. We conduct experiments using three distinct closed-book question-answering datasets across five popular pre-trained LLMs. Lastly, we validate the efficacy of MARS on a Medical QA dataset. Code can be found here.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.419	Yavuz Faruk Bakman, Duygu Nur Yaldiz, Baturalp Buyukates, Chenyang Tao, Dimitrios Dimitriadis, Salman Avestimehr
EIT: Enhanced Interactive Transformer	Two principles: the complementary principle and the consensus principle are widely acknowledged in the literature of multi-view learning. However, the current design of multi-head self-attention, an instance of multi-view learning, prioritizes the complementarity while ignoring the consensus. To address this problem, we propose an enhanced multi-head self-attention (EMHA). First, to satisfy the complementary principle, EMHA removes the one-to-one mapping constraint among queries and keys in multiple subspaces and allows each query to attend to multiple keys. On top of that, we develop a method to fully encourage consensus among heads by introducing two interaction models, namely inner-subspace interaction and cross-subspace interaction. Extensive experiments on a wide range of language tasks (e.g., machine translation, abstractive summarization and grammar correction, language modeling), show its superiority, with a very modest increase in model size. Our code would be available at: https://github.com/zhengkid/EIT-Enhanced-Interactive-Transformer.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.418	Tong Zheng, Bei Li, Huiwen Bao, Tong Xiao, JingBo Zhu
STICKERCONV: Generating Multimodal Empathetic Responses from Scratch	Stickers, while widely recognized for enhancing empathetic communication in online interactions, remain underexplored in current empathetic dialogue research, notably due to the challenge of a lack of comprehensive datasets. In this paper, we introduce the Agent for STICKERCONV (Agent4SC), which uses collaborative agent interactions to realistically simulate human behavior with sticker usage, thereby enhancing multimodal empathetic communication. Building on this foundation, we develop a multimodal empathetic dialogue dataset, STICKERCONV, comprising 12.9K dialogue sessions, 5.8K unique stickers, and 2K diverse conversational scenarios. This dataset serves as a benchmark for multimodal empathetic generation. To advance further, we propose PErceive and Generate Stickers (PEGS), a multimodal empathetic response generation framework, complemented by a comprehensive set of empathy evaluation metrics based on LLM. Our experiments demonstrate PEGS's effectiveness in generating contextually relevant and emotionally resonant multimodal empathetic responses, contributing to the advancement of more nuanced and engaging empathetic dialogue systems.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.417	Yiqun Zhang, Fanheng Kong, Peidong Wang, Shuang Sun, SWangLing SWangLing, Shi Feng, Daling Wang, Yifei Zhang, Kaisong Song
Label Augmentation for Zero-Shot Hierarchical Text Classification	Hierarchical Text Classification poses the difficult challenge of classifying documents into multiple labels organized in a hierarchy. The vast majority of works aimed to address this problem relies on supervised methods which are difficult to implement due to the scarcity of labeled data in many real world applications. This paper focuses on strict Zero-Shot Classification, the setting in which the system lacks both labeled instances and training data.We propose a novel approach that uses a Large Language Model to augment the deepest layer of the labels hierarchy in order to enhance its specificity. We achieve this by generating semantically relevant labels as children connected to the existing branches, creating a deeper taxonomy that better overlaps with the input texts. We leverage the enriched hierarchy to perform Zero-Shot Hierarchical Classification by using the Upward score Propagation technique. We test our method on four public datasets, obtaining new state-of-the art results on three of them. We introduce two cosine similarity-based metrics to quantify the density and granularity of a label taxonomy and we show a strong correlation between the metric values and the classification performance of our method on the datasets.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.416	Lorenzo Paletto, Valerio Basile, Roberto Esposito
Angry Men, Sad Women: Large Language Models Reflect Gendered Stereotypes in Emotion Attribution	Large language models (LLMs) reflect societal norms and biases, especially about gender. While societal biases and stereotypes have been extensively researched in various NLP applications, there is a surprising gap for emotion analysis. However, emotion and gender are closely linked in societal discourse. E.g., women are often thought of as more empathetic, while men's anger is more socially accepted. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive study of gendered emotion attribution in five state-of-the-art LLMs (open- and closed-source). We investigate whether emotions are gendered, and whether these variations are based on societal stereotypes. We prompt the models to adopt a gendered persona and attribute emotions to an event like 'When I had a serious argument with a dear person'. We then analyze the emotions generated by the models in relation to the gender-event pairs. We find that all models consistently exhibit gendered emotions, influenced by gender stereotypes. These findings are in line with established research in psychology and gender studies. Our study sheds light on the complex societal interplay between language, gender, and emotion. The reproduction of emotion stereotypes in LLMs allows us to use those models to study the topic in detail, but raises questions about the predictive use of those same LLMs for emotion applications.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.415	Flor Plaza-del-Arco, Amanda Curry, Alba Cercas Curry, Gavin Abercrombie, Dirk Hovy
Conundrums in Cross-Prompt Automated Essay Scoring: Making Sense of the State of the Art	Cross-prompt automated essay scoring (AES), an under-investigated but challenging task that has gained increasing popularity in the AES community, aims to train an AES system that can generalize well to prompts that are unseen during model training. While recently-developed cross-prompt AES models have combined essay representations that are learned via sophisticated neural architectures with so-called prompt-independent features, an intriguing question is: are complex neural models needed to achieve state-of-the-art results? We answer this question by abandoning sophisticated neural architectures and developing a purely feature-based approach to cross-prompt AES that adopts a simple neural architecture. Experiments on the ASAP dataset demonstrate that our simple approach to cross-prompt AES can achieve state-of-the-art results.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.414	Shengjie Li, Vincent Ng
HD-Eval: Aligning Large Language Model Evaluators Through Hierarchical Criteria Decomposition	Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to expensive human evaluations. However, the alignment and coverage of LLM-based evaluations are often limited by the scope and potential bias of the evaluation prompts and criteria. To address this challenge, we propose HD-Eval, a novel framework that iteratively aligns LLM-based evaluators with human preference via Hierarchical Criteria Decomposition. HD-Eval inherits the essence from the evaluation mindset of human experts and enhances the alignment of LLM-based evaluators by decomposing a given evaluation task into finer-grained criteria, aggregating them according to estimated human preferences, pruning insignificant criteria with attribution, and further decomposing significant criteria. By integrating these steps within an iterative alignment training process, we obtain a hierarchical decomposition of criteria that comprehensively captures aspects of natural language at multiple levels of granularity. Implemented as a white box, the human preference-guided aggregator is efficient to train and more explainable than relying solely on prompting, and its independence from model parameters makes it applicable to closed-source LLMs. Extensive experiments on three evaluation domains demonstrate the superiority of HD-Eval in further aligning state-of-the-art evaluators and providing deeper insights into the explanation of evaluation results and the task itself.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.413	Yuxuan Liu, Tianchi Yang, Shaohan Huang, Zihan Zhang, Haizhen Huang, Furu Wei, Weiwei Deng, Feng Sun, Qi Zhang
FreeCtrl: Constructing Control Centers with Feedforward Layers for Learning-Free Controllable Text Generation	Controllable text generation (CTG) seeks to craft texts adhering to specific attributes, traditionally employing learning-based techniques such as training, fine-tuning, or prefix-tuning with attribute-specific datasets. These approaches, while effective, demand extensive computational and data resources. In contrast, some proposed learning-free alternatives circumvent learning but often yield inferior results, exemplifying the fundamental machine learning trade-off between computational expense and model efficacy. To overcome these limitations, we propose FreeCtrl, a learning-free approach that dynamically adjusts the weights of selected feedforward neural network (FFN) vectors to steer the outputs of large language models (LLMs). FreeCtrl hinges on the principle that the weights of different FFN vectors influence the likelihood of different tokens appearing in the output. By identifying and adaptively adjusting the weights of attribute-related FFN vectors, FreeCtrl can control the output likelihood of attribute keywords in the generated content. Extensive experiments on single- and multi-attribute control reveal that the learning-free FreeCtrl outperforms other learning-free and learning-based methods, successfully resolving the dilemma between learning costs and model performance.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.412	Zijian Feng, Hanzhang Zhou, Kezhi Mao, Zixiao Zhu
ReFT: Reasoning with Reinforced Fine-Tuning	One way to enhance the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is to conduct Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations. This approach does not show sufficiently strong generalization ability, however, because the training only relies on the given CoT data. In math problem-solving, for example, there is usually only one annotated reasoning path for each question in the training data. Intuitively, it would be better for the algorithm to learn from multiple annotated reasoning paths given a question. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach called Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) to enhance the generalizability of learning LLMs for reasoning, with math problem-solving as an example. ReFT first warmups the model with SFT, and then employs on-line reinforcement learning, specifically the PPO algorithm in this paper, to further fine-tune the model, where an abundance of reasoning paths are automatically sampled given the question and the rewards are naturally derived from the ground-truth answers. Extensive experiments on GSM8K, MathQA, and SVAMP datasets show that ReFT significantly outperforms SFT, and the performance can be potentially further boosted by combining inference-time strategies such as majority voting and re-ranking. Note that ReFT obtains the improvement by learning from the same training questions as SFT, without relying on extra or augmented training questions. This indicates a superior generalization ability for ReFT.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.410	Luong Trung, Xinbo Zhang, Zhanming Jie, Peng Sun, Xiaoran Jin, Hang Li
Cognitive Visual-Language Mapper: Advancing Multimodal Comprehension with Enhanced Visual Knowledge Alignment	Evaluating and Rethinking the current landscape of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), we observe that widely-used visual-language projection approaches (e.g., Q-former or MLP) focus on the alignment of image-text descriptions yet ignore the visual knowledge-dimension alignment, i.e., connecting visuals to their relevant knowledge. Visual knowledge plays a significant role in analyzing, inferring, and interpreting information from visuals, helping improve the accuracy of answers to knowledge-based visual questions. In this paper, we mainly explore improving LMMs with visual-language knowledge alignment, especially aimed at challenging knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA). To this end, we present a Cognitive Visual-Language Mapper (CVLM), which contains a pretrained Visual Knowledge Aligner (VKA) and a Fine-grained Knowledge Adapter (FKA) used in the multimodal instruction tuning stage. Specifically, we design the VKA based on the interaction between a small language model and a visual encoder, training it on collected image-knowledge pairs to achieve visual knowledge acquisition and projection. FKA is employed to distill the fine-grained visual knowledge of an image and inject it into Large Language Models (LLMs). We conduct extensive experiments on knowledge-based VQA benchmarks and experimental results show that CVLM significantly improves the performance of LMMs on knowledge-based VQA (average gain by 5.0%). Ablation studies also verify the effectiveness of VKA and FKA, respectively.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.411	Yunxin Li, Xinyu Chen, Baotian Hu, Haoyuan Shi, Min Zhang
Unlocking the Power of Large Language Models for Entity Alignment	Entity Alignment (EA) is vital for integrating diverse knowledge graph (KG) data, playing a crucial role in data-driven AI applications. Traditional EA methods primarily rely on comparing entity embeddings, but their effectiveness is constrained by the limited input KG data and the capabilities of the representation learning techniques. Against this backdrop, we introduce ChatEA, an innovative framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) to improve EA. To address the constraints of limited input KG data, ChatEA introduces a KG-code translation module that translates KG structures into a format understandable by LLMs, thereby allowing LLMs to utilize their extensive background knowledge to improve EA accuracy. To overcome the over-reliance on entity embedding comparisons, ChatEA implements a two-stage EA strategy that capitalizes on LLMs' capability for multi-step reasoning in a dialogue format, thereby enhancing accuracy while preserving efficiency. Our experimental results affirm ChatEA's superior performance, highlighting LLMs' potential in facilitating EA tasks.The source code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ChatEA/.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.408	Xuhui Jiang, Yinghan Shen, Zhichao Shi, Chengjin Xu, Wei Li, Zixuan Li, Jian Guo, Huawei Shen, Yuanzhuo Wang
Trial and Error: Exploration-Based Trajectory Optimization of LLM Agents	Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral components in various autonomous agent systems.In this study, we present an exploration-based trajectory optimization approach, referred to as ETO. This learning method is designed to enhance the performance of open LLM agents. Contrary to previous studies that exclusively train on successful expert trajectories, our method allows agents to learn from their exploration failures. This leads to improved performance through an iterative optimization framework. During the exploration phase, the agent interacts with the environment while completing given tasks, gathering failure trajectories to create contrastive trajectory pairs. In the subsequent training phase, the agent utilizes these trajectory preference pairs to update its policy using contrastive learning methods like DPO. This iterative cycle of exploration and training fosters continued improvement in the agents. Our experiments on three complex tasks demonstrate that ETO consistently surpasses baseline performance by a large margin. Furthermore, an examination of task-solving efficiency and potential in scenarios lacking expert trajectory underscores the effectiveness of our approach.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.409	Yifan Song, Da Yin, Xiang Yue, Jie Huang, Sujian Li, Bill Yuchen Lin
SEGO: Sequential Subgoal Optimization for Mathematical Problem-Solving	Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven substantial progress in artificial intelligence in recent years, exhibiting impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including mathematical problem-solving. Inspired by the success of subgoal-based methods, we propose a novel framework called SEquential subGoal Optimization (SEGO) to enhance LLMs' ability to solve mathematical problems. By establishing a connection between the subgoal breakdown process and the probability of solving problems, SEGO aims to identify better subgoals with theoretical guarantees. Addressing the challenge of identifying suitable subgoals in a large solution space, our framework generates problem-specific subgoals and adjusts them according to carefully designed criteria. Incorporating these optimized subgoals into the policy model training leads to significant improvements in problem-solving performance. We validate SEGO's efficacy through experiments on two benchmarks, GSM8K and MATH, where our approach outperforms existing methods, highlighting the potential of SEGO in AI-driven mathematical problem-solving.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.407	Xueliang Zhao, Xinting Huang, Wei Bi, Lingpeng Kong
Can LLMs Reason with Rules? Logic Scaffolding for Stress-Testing and Improving LLMs	Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive human-like performance across various reasoning tasks. However, their mastery of underlying inferential rules still falls short of human capabilities. To investigate this, we propose a logic scaffolding inferential rule generation framework, to construct an inferential rule base, ULogic, comprising both primitive and compositional rules across five domains. Our analysis of GPT-series models over a rule subset reveals significant gaps in LLMs' logic understanding compared to human performance, especially in compositional and structural complex rules with certain bias patterns. We further distill these rules into a smaller-scale inference engine for flexible rule generation and enhancing downstream reasoning. Through a multi-judger evaluation, our inference engine proves effective in generating accurate, complex and abstract conclusions and premises, and improve various commonsense reasoning tasks. Overall, our work sheds light on LLMs' limitations in grasping inferential rule and suggests ways to enhance their logical reasoning abilities .	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.406	Siyuan Wang, Zhongyu Wei, Yejin Choi, Xiang Ren
LangBridge: Multilingual Reasoning Without Multilingual Supervision	We introduce LangBridge, a zero-shot approach to adapt language models for multilingual reasoning tasks without multilingual supervision. LangBridge operates by bridging two models, each specialized in different aspects: (1) one specialized in understanding multiple languages (e.g., mT5 encoder) and (2) one specialized in reasoning (e.g., MetaMath). LangBridge connects the two models by introducing minimal trainable parameters between them. Despite utilizing only English data for training, LangBridge considerably enhances the performance of language models on low-resource languages across mathematical reasoning, code completion, logical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning. Our analysis suggests that the efficacy of LangBridge stems from the language-agnostic characteristics of multilingual representations. We publicly release our code and models.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.405	Dongkeun Yoon, Joel Jang, Sungdong Kim, Seungone Kim, Sheikh Shafayat, Minjoon Seo
Advancement in Graph Understanding: A Multimodal Benchmark and Fine-Tuning of Vision-Language Models	Graph data organizes complex relationships and interactions between objects, facilitating advanced analysis and decision-making across different fields. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for interactive and instructional graph data understanding and reasoning.Instead of adopting complex graph neural models or heuristic graph-to-text instruction design, we leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to encode the graph images with varying structures across different domains. This paper first evaluates the capabilities of public VLMs in graph learning from multiple aspects. Then it introduces a novel instruction-following dataset for multimodal graph understanding and reasoning in English and Chinese. Besides, by fine-tuning MiniGPT-4 and LLaVA on our dataset, we achieved an accuracy increase of 5%-15% compared to baseline models, with the best-performing model attaining scores comparable to Gemini in GPT-asissted Evaluation. This research not only showcases the potential of integrating VLMs with graph data but also opens new avenues for advancements in graph data understanding.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.404	Qihang Ai, Jiafan Li, Jincheng Dai, Jianwu Zhou, Lemao Liu, Haiyun Jiang, Shuming Shi
What Evidence Do Language Models Find Convincing?	"Retrieval-augmented language models are being increasingly tasked with subjective, contentious, and conflicting queries such as ""is aspartame linked to cancer"". To resolve these ambiguous queries, one must search through a large range of websites and consider ""which, if any, of this evidence do I find convincing?"". In this work, we study how LLMs answer this question. In particular, we construct ConflictingQA, a dataset that pairs controversial queries with a series of real-world evidence documents that contain different facts (e.g., quantitative results), argument styles (e.g., appeals to authority), and answers (Yes or No). We use this dataset to perform sensitivity and counterfactual analyses to explore which text features most affect LLM predictions. Overall, we find that current models rely heavily on the relevance of a website to the query, while largely ignoring stylistic features that humans find important such as whether a text contains scientific references or is written with a neutral tone. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of RAG corpus quality (e.g., the need to filter misinformation), and possibly even a shift in how LLMs are trained to better align with human judgements."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.403	Alexander Wan, Eric Wallace, Dan Klein
EFSA: Towards Event-Level Financial Sentiment Analysis	In this paper, we extend financial sentiment analysis (FSA) to event-level since events usually serve as the subject of the sentiment in financial text. Though extracting events from the financial text may be conducive to accurate sentiment predictions, it has specialized challenges due to the lengthy and discontinuity of events in a financial text. To this end, we reconceptualize the event extraction as a classification task by designing a categorization comprising coarse-grained and fine-grained event categories. Under this setting, we formulate the Event-Level Financial Sentiment Analysis(EFSA for short) task that outputs quintuples consisting of (company, industry, coarse-grained event, fine-grained event, sentiment) from financial text. A large-scale Chinese dataset containing 12,160 news articles and 13,725 quintuples is publicized as a brand new testbed for our task. A four-hop Chain-of-Thought LLM-based approach is devised for this task. Systematically investigations are conducted on our dataset, and the empirical results demonstrate the benchmarking scores of existing methods and our proposed method can reach the current state-of-the-art. Our dataset and framework implementation are available at https://github.com/cty1934/EFSA	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.402	Tianyu Chen, Yiming Zhang, Guoxin Yu, Dapeng Zhang, Li Zeng, Qing He, Xiang Ao
MT-Bench-101: A Fine-Grained Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Multi-Turn Dialogues	The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has drastically enhanced dialogue systems. However, comprehensively evaluating the dialogue abilities of LLMs remains a challenge. Previous benchmarks have primarily focused on single-turn dialogues or provided coarse-grained and incomplete assessments of multi-turn dialogues, overlooking the complexity and fine-grained nuances of real-life dialogues. To address this issue, we introduce MT-Bench-101, specifically designed to evaluate the fine-grained abilities of LLMs in multi-turn dialogues. By conducting a detailed analysis of real multi-turn dialogue data, we construct a three-tier hierarchical ability taxonomy comprising 4208 turns across 1388 multi-turn dialogues in 13 distinct tasks. We then evaluate 21 popular LLMs based on MT-Bench-101, conducting comprehensive analyses from both ability and task perspectives and observing differing trends in LLMs performance across dialogue turns within various tasks. Further analysis indicates that neither utilizing common alignment techniques nor chat-specific designs has led to obvious enhancements in the multi-turn abilities of LLMs. Extensive case studies suggest that our designed tasks accurately assess the corresponding multi-turn abilities. The data and code are available at https://github.com/mtbench101/mt-bench-101.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.401	Ge Bai, Jie Liu, Xingyuan Bu, Yancheng He, Jiaheng Liu, Zhanhui Zhou, Zhuoran Lin, Wenbo Su, Tiezheng Ge, Bo Zheng, Wanli Ouyang
AboutMe: Using Self-Descriptions in Webpages to Document the Effects of English Pretraining Data Filters	"Large language models' (LLMs) abilities are drawn from their pretraining data, and model development begins with data curation. However, decisions around what data is retained or removed during this initial stage are under-scrutinized. In our work, we ground web text, which is a popular pretraining data source, to its social and geographic contexts. We create a new dataset of 10.3 million self-descriptions of website creators, and extract information about who they are and where they are from: their topical interests, social roles, and geographic affiliations. Then, we conduct the first study investigating how ten ""quality"" and English language identification (langID) filters affect webpages that vary along these social dimensions. Our experiments illuminate a range of implicit preferences in data curation: we show that some quality classifiers act like topical domain filters, and langID can overlook English content from some regions of the world. Overall, we hope that our work will encourage a new line of research on pretraining data curation practices and its social implications."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.400	Li Lucy, Suchin Gururangan, Luca Soldaini, Emma Strubell, David Bamman, Lauren Klein, Jesse Dodge
LaMP: When Large Language Models Meet Personalization	This paper highlights the importance of personalization in large language models and introduces the LaMP benchmark — a novel benchmark for training and evaluating language models for producing personalized outputs. LaMP offers a comprehensive evaluation framework with diverse language tasks and multiple entries for each user profile. It consists of seven personalized tasks, spanning three text classification and four text generation tasks. We additionally propose two retrieval augmentation approaches that retrieve personal items from each user profile for personalizing language model outputs. To this aim, we study various retrieval models, including term matching, semantic matching, and time-aware methods. Extensive experiments on LaMP for zero-shot and fine-tuned language models demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed retrieval augmentation approach and highlight the impact of personalization in various natural language tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.399	Alireza Salemi, Sheshera Mysore, Michael Bendersky, Hamed Zamani
Multimodal Contextualized Semantic Parsing from Speech	We introduce Semantic Parsing in Contextual Environments (SPICE), a task designed to enhance artificial agents' contextual awareness by integrating multimodal inputs with prior contexts. SPICE goes beyond traditional semantic parsing by offering a structured, interpretable framework for dynamically updating an agent's knowledge with new information, mirroring the complexity of human communication. We develop the VG-SPICE dataset, crafted to challenge agents with visual scene graph construction from spoken conversational exchanges, highlighting speech and visual data integration. We also present the Audio-Vision Dialogue Scene Parser (AViD-SP) developed for use on VG-SPICE. These innovations aim to improve multimodal information processing and integration. Both the VG-SPICE dataset and the AViD-SP model are publicly available.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.398	Jordan Voas, David Harwath, Ray Mooney
Generate-then-Ground in Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Multi-hop Question Answering	Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) task presents a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to the intensive knowledge required. Current solutions, like Retrieval-Augmented Generation, typically retrieve potential documents from an external corpus to read an answer. However, the performance of this retrieve-then-read paradigm is constrained by the retriever and the inevitable noise in the retrieved documents. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a novel generate-then-ground (GenGround) framework, synergizing the parametric knowledge of LLMs and external documents to solve a multi-hop question. GenGround empowers LLMs to alternate two phases until the final answer is derived: (1) formulate a simpler, single-hop question and directly generate the answer; (2) ground the question-answer pair into retrieved documents, amending any wrong predictions in the answer. We also propose an instructional grounding distillation method to generalize our method into smaller models. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets illustrate the superiority of our method. To further facilitate future research, we have collected a dataset that traces the reasoning process.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.397	Zhengliang Shi, Shuo Zhang, Weiwei Sun, Shen Gao, Pengjie Ren, Zhumin Chen, Zhaochun Ren
StreamVoice: Streamable Context-Aware Language Modeling for Real-time Zero-Shot Voice Conversion	Recent language model (LM) advancements have showcased impressive zero-shot voice conversion (VC) performance. However, existing LM-based VC models usually apply offline conversion from source semantics to acoustic features, demanding the complete source speech and limiting their deployment to real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce StreamVoice, a novel streaming LM-based model for zero-shot VC, facilitating real-time conversion given arbitrary speaker prompts and source speech. Specifically, to enable streaming capability, StreamVoice employs a fully causal context-aware LM with a temporal-independent acoustic predictor, while alternately processing semantic and acoustic features at each time step of autoregression which eliminates the dependence on complete source speech. To address the potential performance degradation from the incomplete context in streaming processing, we enhance the context-awareness of the LM through two strategies: 1) teacher-guided context foresight, using a teacher model to summarize the present and future semantic context during training to guide the model's forecasting for missing context; 2) semantic masking strategy, promoting acoustic prediction from preceding corrupted semantic and acoustic input, enhancing context-learning ability. Notably, StreamVoice is the first LM-based streaming zero-shot VC model without any future look-ahead. Experiments demonstrate StreamVoice's streaming conversion capability while achieving zero-shot performance comparable to non-streaming VC systems.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.396	Zhichao Wang, Yuanzhe Chen, Xinsheng Wang, Lei Xie, Yuping Wang
Prompt Optimization via Adversarial In-Context Learning	We propose a new method, Adversarial In-Context Learning (adv-ICL), to optimize prompts for in-context learning (ICL). Inspired by adversarial learning, adv-ICL is implemented as a two-player game between a generator and discriminator, with LLMs acting as both. In each round, given an input prefixed by task instructions and several exemplars, the generator produces an output. The discriminator then classifies the generator's input-output pair as model-generated or real data. Based on the discriminator's loss, a prompt modifier LLM proposes possible edits to the generator and discriminator prompts, and the edits that most improve the adversarial loss are selected. We show that applying adv-ICL results in significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques for both open and closed-source models on 13 generation and classification tasks including summarization, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, data-to-text generation, and the MMLU and big-bench hard benchmarks. In addition, our method is computationally efficient, easily extensible to other LLMs and tasks, and effective in low-resource settings.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.395	Do Long, Yiran Zhao, Hannah Brown, Yuxi Xie, James Zhao, Nancy Chen, Kenji Kawaguchi, Michael Shieh, Junxian He
CQIL: Inference Latency Optimization with Concurrent Computation of Quasi-Independent Layers	The fast-growing large scale language models are delivering unprecedented performance on almost all natural language processing tasks. However, the effectiveness of large language models are reliant on an exponentially increasing number of parameters. The overwhelming computation complexity incurs a high inference latency that negatively affects user experience. Existing methods to improve inference efficiency, such as tensor parallelism and quantization, target to reduce per-layer computing latency, yet overlook the cumulative latency due to the number of layers. Recent works on reducing the cumulative latency through layer removing, however, lead to significant performance drop. Motivated by the similarity of inputs among adjacent layers, we propose to identify quasi-independent layers, which can be concurrently computed to significantly decrease inference latency. We also introduce a bypassing technique to mitigate the effect of information loss. Empirical experiments of the proposed approach on the LLaMA models confirm that Concurrent Computation of Quasi-Independent Layers (CQIL) can reduce latency by up to 48.3% on LLaMA-33B, while maintaining a close level of performance.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.394	Longwei Zou, Qingyang Wang, Han Zhao, Jiangangkong Jiangangkong, Yi Yang, Yangdong Deng
Enhancing EEG-to-Text Decoding through Transferable Representations from Pre-trained Contrastive EEG-Text Masked Autoencoder	Reconstructing natural language from non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) holds great promise as a language decoding technology for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, EEG-based language decoding is still in its nascent stages, facing several technical issues such as: 1) Absence of a hybrid strategy that can effectively integrate cross-modality (between EEG and text) self-learning with intra-modality self-reconstruction of EEG features or textual sequences; 2) Under-utilization of large language models (LLMs) to enhance EEG-based language decoding. To address above issues, we propose the Contrastive EEG-Text Masked Autoencoder (CET-MAE), a novel model that orchestrates compound self-supervised learning across and within EEG and text through a dedicated multi-stream encoder. Furthermore, we develop a framework called E2T-PTR (EEG-to-Text decoding using Pretrained Transferable Representations), which leverages pre-trained modules alongside the EEG stream from CET-MAE and further enables an LLM (specifically BART) to decode text from EEG sequences. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the popular text-evoked EEG database, ZuCo, demonstrate the superiority of E2T-PTR, which outperforms the baseline framework in ROUGE-1 F1 and BLEU-4 scores by 8.34% and 32.21%, respectively. Our proposed pre-trained EEG-Text model shows the potential to improve downstream tasks involving EEG and text. This opens up promising avenues for its application in inner speech BCI paradigms, meriting further investigation.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.393	Jiaqi Wang, Zhenxi Song, Zhengyu Ma, Xipeng Qiu, Min Zhang, Zhiguo Zhang
Can We Achieve High-quality Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation without Parallel Speech Data?	Recently proposed two-pass direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) models decompose the task into speech-to-text translation (S2TT) and text-to-speech (TTS) within an end-to-end model, yielding promising results. However, the training of these models still relies on parallel speech data, which is extremely challenging to collect. In contrast, S2TT and TTS have accumulated a large amount of data and pretrained models, which have not been fully utilized in the development of S2ST models. Inspired by this, in this paper, we first introduce a composite S2ST model named ComSpeech, which can seamlessly integrate any pretrained S2TT and TTS models into a direct S2ST model. Furthermore, to eliminate the reliance on parallel speech data, we propose a novel training method ComSpeech-ZS that solely utilizes S2TT and TTS data. It aligns representations in the latent space through contrastive learning, enabling the speech synthesis capability learned from the TTS data to generalize to S2ST in a zero-shot manner. Experimental results on the CVSS dataset show that when the parallel speech data is available, ComSpeech surpasses previous two-pass models like UnitY and Translatotron 2 in both translation quality and decoding speed. When there is no parallel speech data, ComSpeech-ZS lags behind by only 0.7 ASR-BLEU and outperforms the cascaded models.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.392	Qingkai Fang, Shaolei Zhang, Zhengrui Ma, Min Zhang, Yang Feng
End-to-end Learning of Logical Rules for Enhancing Document-level Relation Extraction	Document-level relation extraction (DocRE) aims to extract relations between entities in a whole document. One of the pivotal challenges of DocRE is to capture the intricate interdependencies between relations of entity pairs. Previous methods have shown that logical rules can explicitly help capture such interdependencies. These methods either learn logical rules to refine the output of a trained DocRE model, or first learn logical rules from annotated data and then inject the learnt rules into a DocRE model using an auxiliary training objective. However, these learning pipelines may suffer from the issue of error propagation. To mitigate this issue, we propose Joint Modeling Relation extraction and Logical rules or JMRL for short, a novel rule-based framework that jointly learns both a DocRE model and logical rules in an end-to-end fashion. Specifically, we parameterize a rule reasoning module in JMRL to simulate the inference of logical rules, thereby explicitly modeling the reasoning process. We also introduce an auxiliary loss and a residual connection mechanism in JMRL to better reconcile the DocRE model and the rule reasoning module. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed JMRL framework is consistently superior to existing rule-based frameworks, improving five baseline models for DocRE by a significant margin.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.391	Kunxun Qi, Jianfeng Du, Hai Wan
From Moments to Milestones: Incremental Timeline Summarization Leveraging Large Language Models	Timeline summarization (TLS) is essential for distilling coherent narratives from a vast collection of texts, tracing the progression of events and topics over time. Prior research typically focuses on either event or topic timeline summarization, neglecting the potential synergy of these two forms. In this study, we bridge this gap by introducing a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) for generating both event and topic timelines. Our approach diverges from conventional TLS by prioritizing event detection, leveraging LLMs as pseudo-oracles for incremental event clustering and the construction of timelines from a text stream. As a result, it produces a more interpretable pipeline. Empirical evaluation across four TLS benchmarks reveals that our approach outperforms the best prior published approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in timeline summarization for real-world applications.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.390	Qisheng Hu, Geonsik Moon, Hwee Tou Ng
Intrinsic Task-based Evaluation for Referring Expression Generation	Recently, a human evaluation study of Referring Expression Generation (REG) models had an unexpected conclusion: on WEBNLG, Referring Expressions (REs) generated by the state-of-the-art neural models were not only indistinguishable from the REs in WEBNLG but also from the REs generated by a simple rule-based system. Here, we argue that this limitation could stem from the use of a purely ratings-based human evaluation (which is a common practice in Natural Language Generation). To investigate these issues, we propose an intrinsic task-based evaluation for REG models, in which, in addition to rating the quality of REs, participants were asked to accomplish two meta-level tasks. One of these tasks concerns the referential success of each RE; the other task asks participants to suggest a better alternative for each RE. The outcomes suggest that, in comparison to previous evaluations, the new evaluation protocol assesses the performance of each REG model more comprehensively and makes the participants' ratings more reliable and discriminable.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.389	Guanyi Chen, Fahime Same, Kees Van Deemter
Leveraging Large Language Models for Learning Complex Legal Concepts through Storytelling	Making legal knowledge accessible to non-experts is crucial for enhancing general legal literacy and encouraging civic participation in democracy. However, legal documents are often challenging to understand for people without legal backgrounds. In this paper, we present a novel application of large language models (LLMs) in legal education to help non-experts learn intricate legal concepts through storytelling, an effective pedagogical tool in conveying complex and abstract concepts. We also introduce a new dataset LegalStories, which consists of 294 complex legal doctrines, each accompanied by a story and a set of multiple-choice questions generated by LLMs. To construct the dataset, we experiment with various LLMs to generate legal stories explaining these concepts. Furthermore, we use an expert-in-the-loop approach to iteratively design multiple-choice questions. Then, we evaluate the effectiveness of storytelling with LLMs through randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with legal novices on 10 samples from the dataset. We find that LLM-generated stories enhance comprehension of legal concepts and interest in law among non-native speakers compared to only definitions. Moreover, stories consistently help participants relate legal concepts to their lives. Finally, we find that learning with stories shows a higher retention rate for non-native speakers in the follow-up assessment. Our work has strong implications for using LLMs in promoting teaching and learning in the legal field and beyond.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.388	Hang Jiang, Xiajie Zhang, Robert Mahari, Daniel Kessler, Eric Ma, Tal August, Irene Li, Alex Pentland, Yoon Kim, Deb Roy, Jad Kabbara
An Investigation of Neuron Activation as a Unified Lens to Explain Chain-of-Thought Eliciting Arithmetic Reasoning of LLMs	"Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong arithmetic reasoning capabilities when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. However, we have only a limited understanding of how they are processed by LLMs. To demystify it, prior work has primarily focused on ablating different components in the CoT prompt and empirically observing their resulting LLM performance change. Yet, the reason why these components are important to LLM reasoning is not explored. To fill this gap, in this work, we investigate ""neuron activation"" as a lens to provide a unified explanation to observations made by prior work. Specifically, we look into neurons within the feed-forward layers of LLMs that may have activated their arithmetic reasoning capabilities, using Llama2 as an example. To facilitate this investigation, we also propose an approach based on GPT-4 to automatically identify neurons that imply arithmetic reasoning. Our analyses revealed that the activation of reasoning neurons in the feed-forward layers of an LLM can explain the importance of various components in a CoT prompt, and future research can extend it for a more complete understanding."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.387	Daking Rai, Ziyu Yao
ChiMed-GPT: A Chinese Medical Large Language Model with Full Training Regime and Better Alignment to Human Preferences	Recently, the increasing demand for superior medical services has highlighted the discrepancies in the medical infrastructure. With big data, especially texts, forming the foundation of medical services, there is an exigent need for effective natural language processing (NLP) solutions tailored to the healthcare domain. Conventional approaches leveraging pre-trained models present promising results in this domain and current large language models (LLMs) offer advanced foundation for medical text processing. However, most medical LLMs are trained only with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), even though it efficiently empowers LLMs to understand and respond to medical instructions but is ineffective in learning domain knowledge and aligning with human preference. In this work, we propose ChiMed-GPT, a new benchmark LLM designed explicitly for Chinese medical domain, and undergoes a comprehensive training regime with pre-training, SFT, and RLHF. Evaluations on tasks including information extraction, question answering, and dialogue generation demonstrate ChiMed-GPT's superior performance over general domain LLMs. Furthermore, we analyze possible biases through prompting ChiMed-GPT to perform attitude scales regarding discrimination of patients, so as to contribute to further responsible development of LLMs in the medical domain.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.386	Yuanhe Tian, Ruyi Gan, Yan Song, Jiaxing Zhang, Yongdong Zhang
Dialogue Summarization with Mixture of Experts based on Large Language Models	Dialogue summarization is an important task that requires to generate highlights for a conversation from different aspects (e.g., content of various speakers). While several studies successfully employ large language models (LLMs) and achieve satisfying results, they are limited by using one model at a time or treat it as a black box, which makes it hard to discriminatively learn essential content in a dialogue from different aspects, therefore may lead to anticipation bias and potential loss of information in the produced summaries. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based approach with role-oriented routing and fusion generation to utilize mixture of experts (MoE) for dialogue summarization. Specifically, the role-oriented routing is an LLM-based module that selects appropriate experts to process different information; fusion generation is another LLM-based module to locate salient information and produce finalized dialogue summaries. The proposed approach offers an alternative solution to employing multiple LLMs for dialogue summarization by leveraging their capabilities of in-context processing and generation in an effective manner. We run experiments on widely used benchmark datasets for this task, where the results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in producing informative and accurate dialogue summarization.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.385	Yuanhe Tian, Fei Xia, Yan Song
Large Language Models Are No Longer Shallow Parsers	The development of large language models (LLMs) brings significant changes to the field of natural language processing (NLP), enabling remarkable performance in various high-level tasks, such as machine translation, question-answering, dialogue generation, etc., under end-to-end settings without requiring much training data. Meanwhile, fundamental NLP tasks, particularly syntactic parsing, are also essential for language study as well as evaluating the capability of LLMs for instruction understanding and usage. In this paper, we focus on analyzing and improving the capability of current state-of-the-art LLMs on a classic fundamental task, namely constituency parsing, which is the representative syntactic task in both linguistics and natural language processing. We observe that these LLMs are effective in shallow parsing but struggle with creating correct full parse trees. To improve the performance of LLMs on deep syntactic parsing, we propose a three-step approach that firstly prompts LLMs for chunking, then filters out low-quality chunks, and finally adds the remaining chunks to prompts to instruct LLMs for parsing, with later enhancement by chain-of-thought prompting. Experimental results on English and Chinese benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on improving LLMs' performance on constituency parsing.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.384	Yuanhe Tian, Fei Xia, Yan Song
Where Do People Tell Stories Online? Story Detection Across Online Communities	Story detection in online communities is a challenging task as stories are scattered across communities and interwoven with non-storytelling spans within a single text. We address this challenge by building and releasing the StorySeeker toolkit, including a richly annotated dataset of 502 Reddit posts and comments, a detailed codebook adapted to the social media context, and models to predict storytelling at the document and span levels. Our dataset is sampled from hundreds of popular English-language Reddit communities ranging across 33 topic categories, and it contains fine-grained expert annotations, including binary story labels, story spans, and event spans. We evaluate a range of detection methods using our data, and we identify the distinctive textual features of online storytelling, focusing on storytelling spans, which we introduce as a new task. We illuminate distributional characteristics of storytelling on a large community-centric social media platform, and we also conduct a case study on r/ChangeMyView, where storytelling is used as one of many persuasive strategies, illustrating that our data and models can be used for both inter- and intra-community research. Finally, we discuss implications of our tools and analyses for narratology and the study of online communities.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.383	Maria Antoniak, Joel Mire, Maarten Sap, Elliott Ash, Andrew Piper
Mirror: Multiple-perspective Self-Reflection Method for Knowledge-rich Reasoning	While Large language models (LLMs) have the capability to iteratively reflect on their own outputs, recent studies have observed their struggles with knowledge-rich problems without access to external resources. In addition to the inefficiency of LLMs in self-assessment, we also observe that LLMs struggle to revisit their predictions despite receiving explicit negative feedback. Therefore, We propose Mirror, a Multiple-perspective self-reflection method for knowledge-rich reasoning, to avoid getting stuck at a particular reflection iteration. Mirror enables LLMs to reflect from multiple-perspective clues, achieved through a heuristic interaction between a Navigator and a Reasoner. It guides agents toward diverse yet plausibly reliable reasoning trajectory without access to ground truth by encouraging (1) diversity of directions generated by Navigator and (2) agreement among strategically induced perturbations in responses generated by the Reasoner. The experiments on five reasoning datasets demonstrate that Mirror's superiority over several contemporary self-reflection approaches. Additionally, the ablation study studies clearly indicate that our strategies alleviate the aforementioned challenges.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.382	Hanqi Yan, Qinglin Zhu, Xinyu Wang, Lin Gui, Yulan He
ReConcile: Round-Table Conference Improves Reasoning via Consensus among Diverse LLMs	Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with natural language reasoning tasks. Motivated by the society of minds (Minsky, 1988), we propose ReConcile, a multi-model multi-agent framework designed as a round table conference among diverse LLM agents. ReConcile enhances collaborative reasoning between LLM agents via multiple rounds of discussion, learning to convince other agents to improve their answers, and employing a confidence-weighted voting mechanism that leads to a better consensus. In each round, ReConcile initiates discussion between agents via a 'discussion prompt' that consists of (a) grouped answers and explanations generated by each agent in the previous round, (b) their confidence scores, and (c) demonstrations of answer-rectifying human explanations, used for convincing other agents. Experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that ReConcile significantly improves LLMs' reasoning – both individually and as a team – surpassing prior single-agent and multi-agent baselines by up to 11.4% and even outperforming GPT-4 on three datasets. ReConcile also flexibly incorporates different combinations of agents, including API-based, open-source, and domain-specific models, leading to an 8% improvement on MATH. Finally, we analyze the individual components of ReConcile, demonstrating that the diversity originating from different models is critical to its superior performance.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.381	Justin Chen, Swarnadeep Saha, Mohit Bansal
MIDGARD: Self-Consistency Using Minimum Description Length for Structured Commonsense Reasoning	We study the task of conducting structured reasoning as generating a reasoning graph from natural language input using large language models (LLMs). Previous approaches have explored various prompting schemes, yet they suffer from error propagation due to the autoregressive nature and single-pass-based decoding, which lack error correction capability. Additionally, relying solely on a single sample may result in the omission of true nodes and edges. To counter this, we draw inspiration from self-consistency (SC), which involves sampling a diverse set of reasoning chains and taking the majority vote as the final answer. To tackle the substantial challenge of applying SC on generated graphs, we propose MIDGARD (MInimum Description length Guided Aggregation of Reasoning in Directed acyclic graph) that leverages Minimum Description Length (MDL)-based formulation to identify consistent properties among the different graph samples generated by an LLM. This formulation helps reject properties that appear in only a few samples, which are likely to be erroneous, while enabling the inclusion of missing elements without compromising precision. Our method demonstrates superior performance than comparisons across various structured reasoning tasks, including argument structure extraction, explanation graph generation, inferring dependency relations among actions for everyday tasks, and semantic graph generation from natural texts.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.380	Inderjeet Nair, Lu Wang
PLUG: Leveraging Pivot Language in Cross-Lingual Instruction Tuning	Instruction tuning has remarkably advanced large language models (LLMs) in understanding and responding to diverse human instructions. Despite the success in high-resource languages, its application in lower-resource ones faces challenges due to the imbalanced foundational abilities of LLMs across different languages, stemming from the uneven language distribution in their pre-training data. To tackle this issue, we propose pivot language guided generation (PLUG), an approach that utilizes a high-resource language, primarily English, as the pivot to enhance instruction tuning in lower-resource languages. It trains the model to first process instructions in the pivot language, and then produce responses in the target language. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a benchmark, X-AlpacaEval, of instructions in 4 languages (Chinese, Korean, Italian, and Spanish), each annotated by professional translators. Our approach demonstrates a significant improvement in the instruction-following abilities of LLMs by 29% on average, compared to directly responding in the target language alone. Further experiments validate the versatility of our approach by employing alternative pivot languages beyond English to assist languages where LLMs exhibit lower proficiency. Code and data are available at https://github.com/ytyz1307zzh/PLUG.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.379	Zhihan Zhang, Dong-Ho Lee, Yuwei Fang, Wenhao Yu, Mengzhao Jia, Meng Jiang, Francesco Barbieri
The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Easy Training Data for Hard Tasks	How can we train models to perform well on hard test data when hard training data is by definition difficult to label correctly? This question has been termed the scalable oversight problem and has drawn increasing attention as language models have continually improved. In this paper, we present the surprising conclusion that current pretrained language models often generalize relatively well from easy to hard data, even performing as well as oracle models finetuned on hard data. We demonstrate this kind of easy-to-hard generalization using simple finetuning methods like in-context learning, linear classifier heads, and QLoRA for seven different measures of datapoint hardness, including six empirically diverse human hardness measures (like grade level) and one model-based measure (loss-based). Furthermore, we show that even if one cares most about model performance on hard data, it can be better to collect easy data rather than hard data for finetuning, since hard data is generally noisier and costlier to collect. Our experiments use open models up to 70b in size and four publicly available question-answering datasets with questions ranging in difficulty from 3rd grade science questions to college level STEM questions and general-knowledge trivia. We conclude that easy-to-hard generalization in LMs is surprisingly strong for the tasks studied.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.378	Peter Hase, Mohit Bansal, Peter Clark, Sarah Wiegreffe
ARIES: A Corpus of Scientific Paper Edits Made in Response to Peer Reviews	We introduce the task of automatically revising scientific papers based on peer feedback and release ARIES, a dataset of review comments and their corresponding paper edits. The data is drawn from real reviewer-author interactions from computer science, and we provide labels linking each reviewer comment to the specific paper edits made by the author in response. We automatically create a high-precision silver training set, as well as an expert-labeled test set that shows high inter-annotator agreement. In experiments with 10 models covering the state of the art, we find that they struggle even to identify which edits correspond to a comment—especially when the relationship between the edit and the comment is indirect and requires reasoning to uncover. We also extensively analyze GPT-4's ability to generate edits given a comment and the original paper. We find that it often succeeds on a superficial level, but tends to rigidly follow the wording of the feedback rather than the underlying intent, and lacks technical details compared to human-written edits.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.377	Mike D’Arcy, Alexis Ross, Erin Bransom, Bailey Kuehl, Jonathan Bragg, Tom Hope, Doug Downey
Lightweight reranking for language model generations	Large Language Models (LLMs) can exhibit considerable variation in the quality of their sampled outputs. Reranking and selecting the best generation from the sampled set is a popular way of obtaining strong gains in generation quality. In this paper, we present a novel approach for reranking LLM generations. Unlike other techniques that might involve additional inferences or training a specialized reranker, our approach relies on easy to compute pairwise statistics between the generations that have minimal compute overhead. We show that our approach can be formalized as an extension of self-consistency and analyze its performance in that framework, theoretically as well as via simulations. We show strong improvements for selecting the best k generations for code generation tasks as well as robust improvements for the best generation for the tasks of autoformalization, summarization, and translation. While our approach only assumes black-box access to LLMs, we show that additional access to token probabilities can improve performance even further.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.376	Siddhartha Jain, Xiaofei Ma, Anoop Deoras, Bing Xiang
Harnessing the Power of Large Language Models for Natural Language to First-Order Logic Translation	Advancements in logical reasoning, utilizing LLMs to convert natural language into logical symbolism, combined with the use of external theorem provers, have repositioned the symbolic approach as a central point of interest. The main challenge within this paradigm lies in the LLMs' capability to accurately translate natural language (NL) statements into first-order-logic (FOL) expressions. Although LLMs have shown notable success, there remains a gap in understanding the limitations and challenges they encounter in NL-FOL translation. This is primarily due to the absence of datasets and evaluation test beds at the required fine-grained level. We present MALLS, a dataset of 28K diverse and verified sentence-level NL-FOL pairs collected from GPT4. We utilize a combined strategy of FOL rule parsing, human annotation, and automatic filtering to ensure quality. We also present LogicLLaMA, a LLaMA2-7B/13B fine-tuned on MALLS for NL-FOL translation, which can be used standalone or to correct previously generated rules by GPT3.5 after being further fine-tuned via a novel reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) framework. We benchmark a wide range of LLMs on MALLS and previous datasets, highlighting weaknesses in them in NL-FOL translation and demonstrating the advantages of MALLS. We also show that LogicLLaMA achieves GPT4-level performance and can generalize to other datasets.

Robust Frame-Semantic Models with Lexical Unit Trees and Negative Samples	We present novel advancements in frame-semantic parsing, specifically focusing on target identification and frame identification. Our target identification model employs a novel prefix tree modification to enable robust support for multi-word lexical units, resulting in a coverage of 99.4% of the targets in the FrameNet 1.7 fulltext annotations. It utilizes a RoBERTa-based filter to achieve an F1 score of 0.775, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art solution by +0.012. For frame identification, we introduce a modification to the standard multiple-choice classification paradigm by incorporating additional negative frames for targets with limited candidate frames, resulting in a +0.014 accuracy improvement over the frame-only model of FIDO, the previous state-of-the-art system, and +0.002 over its full system. Our approach significantly enhances performance on rare frames, exhibiting an improvement of +0.044 over FIDO's accuracy on frames with 5 or fewer samples, and on under-utilized frames, with an improvement of +0.139 on targets with a single candidate frame. Overall, our contributions address critical challenges and advance the state-of-the-art in frame-semantic parsing.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.374	Jacob Devasier, Yogesh Gurjar, Chengkai Li
Leveraging Machine-Generated Rationales to Facilitate Social Meaning Detection in Conversations	We present a generalizable classification approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate the detection of implicitly encoded social meaning in conversations. We design a multi-faceted prompt to extract a textual explanation of the reasoning that connects visible cues to underlying social meanings. These extracted explanations or rationales serve as augmentations to the conversational text to facilitate dialogue understanding and transfer. Our empirical results over 2,340 experimental settings demonstrate the significant positive impact of adding these rationales. Our findings hold true for in-domain classification, zero-shot, and few-shot domain transfer for two different social meaning detection tasks, each spanning two different corpora.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.373	Ritam Dutt, Zhen Wu, Jiaxin Shi, Divyanshu Sheth, Prakhar Gupta, Carolyn Rose
Translation-based Lexicalization Generation and Lexical Gap Detection: Application to Kinship Terms	Constructing lexicons with explicitly identified lexical gaps is a vital part of building multilingual lexical resources. Prior work has leveraged bilingual dictionaries and linguistic typologies for semi-automatic identification of lexical gaps. Instead, we propose a generally-applicable algorithmic method to automatically generate concept lexicalizations, which is based on machine translation and hypernymy relations between concepts. The absence of a lexicalization implies a lexical gap. We apply our method to kinship terms, which make a suitable case study because of their explicit definitions and regular structure. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields higher accuracy than BabelNet and ChatGPT. Our error analysis indicates that enhancing the quality of translations can further improve the accuracy of our method.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.372	Senyu Li, Bradley Hauer, Ning Shi, Grzegorz Kondrak
WebVoyager: Building an End-to-End Web Agent with Large Multimodal Models	The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to a new era marked by the development of autonomous applications in real-world scenarios, which drives innovation in creating advanced web agents. Existing web agents typically only handle one input modality and are evaluated only in simplified web simulators or static web snapshots, greatly limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce WebVoyager, an innovative Large Multimodal Model (LMM) powered web agent that can complete user instructions end-to-end by interacting with real-world websites. Moreover, we establish a new benchmark by compiling real-world tasks from 15 popular websites and introduce an automatic evaluation protocol leveraging multimodal understanding abilities of GPT-4V to evaluate open-ended web agents. We show that WebVoyager achieves a 59.1% task success rate on our benchmark, significantly surpassing the performance of both GPT-4 (All Tools) and the WebVoyager (text-only) setups, underscoring the exceptional capability of WebVoyager. The proposed automatic evaluation metric achieves 85.3% agreement with human judgment, indicating its effectiveness in providing reliable and accurate assessments of web agents.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.371	Hongliang He, Wenlin Yao, Kaixin Ma, Wenhao Yu, Yong Dai, Hongming Zhang, Zhenzhong Lan, Dong Yu
A Glitch in the Matrix? Locating and Detecting Language Model Grounding with Fakepedia	Large language models (LLMs) have an impressive ability to draw on novel information supplied in their context. Yet the mechanisms underlying this contextual grounding remain unknown, especially in situations where contextual information contradicts factual knowledge stored in the parameters, which LLMs also excel at recalling. Favoring the contextual information is critical for retrieval-augmented generation methods, which enrich the context with up-to-date information, hoping that grounding can rectify outdated or noisy stored knowledge. We present a novel method to study grounding abilities using Fakepedia, a novel dataset of counterfactual texts constructed to clash with a model's internal parametric knowledge. In this study, we introduce Fakepedia, a counterfactual dataset designed to evaluate grounding abilities when the internal parametric knowledge clashes with the contextual information. We benchmark various LLMs with Fakepedia and conduct a causal mediation analysis of LLM components when answering Fakepedia queries, based on our Masked Grouped Causal Tracing (MGCT) method. Through this analysis, we identify distinct computational patterns between grounded and ungrounded responses. We finally demonstrate that distinguishing grounded from ungrounded responses is achievable through computational analysis alone. Our results, together with existing findings about factual recall mechanisms, provide a coherent narrative of how grounding and factual recall mechanisms interact within LLMs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.369	Giovanni Monea, Maxime Peyrard, Martin Josifoski, Vishrav Chaudhary, Jason Eisner, Emre Kiciman, Hamid Palangi, Barun Patra, Robert West
Muffin or Chihuahua? Challenging Multimodal Large Language Models with Multipanel VQA	Multipanel images, commonly seen as web screenshots, posters, etc., pervade our daily lives. These images, characterized by their composition of multiple subfigures in distinct layouts, effectively convey information to people. Toward building advanced multimodal AI applications, such as agents that understand complex scenes and navigate through webpages, the skill of multipanel visual reasoning is essential, and a comprehensive evaluation of models in this regard is important. Therefore, we introduce Multipanel Visual Question Answering (MultipanelVQA), a novel benchmark comprising 6,600 triplets of questions, answers, and multipanel images that specifically challenge models in comprehending multipanel images. Our evaluation shows that questions in the MultipanelVQA benchmark pose significant challenges to the state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) tested, even though humans can attain approximately 99% accuracy on these questions. Distinctively, the MultipanelVQA benchmark features synthetically generated multipanel images specifically crafted to isolate and assess the impact of various factors, such as the layout, on MLLMs' multipanel image comprehension abilities. As a result, in addition to benchmarking the capabilities of MLLMs in understanding multipanel images, we analyze various factors of the multipanel image that affect MLLMs' performance with synthetic data and offer insights for enhancement.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.370	Yue Fan, Jing Gu, Kaiwen Zhou, Qianqi Yan, Shan Jiang, Ching-Chen Kuo, Yang Zhao, Xinze Guan, Xin Wang
ProxyQA: An Alternative Framework for Evaluating Long-Form Text Generation with Large Language Models	"Large Language Models (LLMs) have succeeded remarkably in understanding long-form contents. However, exploring their capability for generating long-form contents, such as reports and articles, has been relatively unexplored and inadequately assessed by existing benchmarks. The prevalent evaluation methods, which predominantly rely on crowdsourcing, are recognized for their labor-intensive nature and lack of efficiency, whereas automated metrics, such as the ROUGE score, demonstrate discordance with human judgment criteria. In this paper, we propose ProxyQA, an innovative framework dedicated to assessing long-text generation. ProxyQA comprises in-depth human-curated meta-questions spanning various domains, each accompanied by specific proxy-questions with pre-annotated answers. LLMs are tasked to generate extensive content in response to these meta-questions, by engaging an evaluator and incorporating the generated texts as contextual background, ProxyQA assesses the generated content's quality through the evaluator's accuracy in addressing the proxy-questions. We examine multiple LLMs, emphasizing ProxyQA's demanding nature as a high-quality assessment tool. Human evaluation demonstrates that the proxy-question method is notably self-consistent and aligns closely with human evaluative standards.

XCodeEval: An Execution-based Large Scale Multilingual Multitask Benchmark for Code Understanding, Generation, Translation and Retrieval	Recently, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in generating codes from natural language descriptions, repairing buggy codes, translating codes between languages, and retrieving relevant code segments. However, the evaluation of these models has often been performed in a scattered way on only one or two specific tasks, in a few languages, at a partial granularity (e.g., function) level, and in many cases without proper training data. Even more concerning is that in most cases the evaluation of generated codes has been done in terms of mere lexical overlap with a reference code rather than actual execution. We introduce *xCodeEval*, the largest executable multilingual multitask benchmark to date consisting of 25 M document-level coding examples (16.5 B tokens) from about 7.5 K unique problems covering up to 11 programming languages with execution-level parallelism. It features a total of 7 tasks involving code understanding, generation, translation and retrieval. *xCodeEval* adopts an execution-based evaluation and offers a multilingual code execution engine, *ExecEval* that supports unit test based execution in all the 11 languages. To address the challenge of balancing the distributions of text-code samples over multiple attributes in validation/test sets, we propose a novel data splitting and a data selection schema based on the geometric mean and graph-theoretic principle. Our experiments with OpenAI's LLMs (zero-shot) and open-LLMs (zero-shot and fine-tuned) on the tasks and languages demonstrate to be quite challenging as per the current advancements in language models.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.367	Mohammad Abdullah Matin Khan, M Saiful Bari, Do Long, Weishi Wang, Md Rizwan Parvez, Shafiq Joty
TAMS: Translation-Assisted Morphological Segmentation	Canonical morphological segmentation is the process of analyzing words into the standard (aka underlying) forms of their constituent morphemes.This is a core task in endangered language documentation, and NLP systems have the potential to dramatically speed up this process. In typical language documentation settings, training data for canonical morpheme segmentation is scarce, making it difficult to train high quality models. However, translation data is often much more abundant, and, in this work, we present a method that attempts to leverage translation data in the canonical segmentation task. We propose a character-level sequence-to-sequence model that incorporates representations of translations obtained from pretrained high-resource monolingual language models as an additional signal. Our model outperforms the baseline in a super-low resource setting but yields mixed results on training splits with more data. Additionally, we find that we can achieve strong performance even without needing difficult-to-obtain word level alignments. While further work is needed to make translations useful in higher-resource settings, our model shows promise in severely resource-constrained settings.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.366	Enora Rice, Ali Marashian, Luke Gessler, Alexis Palmer, Katharina Wense
Narrowing the Knowledge Evaluation Gap: Open-Domain Question Answering with Multi-Granularity Answers	"Factual questions typically can be answered correctly at different levels of granularity. For example, both ""August 4, 1961"" and ""1961"" are correct answers to the question ""When was Barack Obama born?"". Standard question answering (QA) evaluation protocols, however, do not explicitly take this into account and compare a predicted answer against answers of a single granularity level. In this work, we propose GRANOLA QA, a novel evaluation setting where a predicted answer is evaluated in terms of accuracy and informativeness against a set of multi-granularity answers. We present a simple methodology for enriching existing datasets with multi-granularity answers, and create GRANOLA-EQ, a multi-granularity version of the EntityQuestions dataset. We evaluate a range of decoding methods on GRANOLA-EQ, including a new algorithm, called Decoding with Response Aggregation (DRAG), that is geared towards aligning the response granularity with the model's uncertainty. Our experiments show that large language models with standard decoding tend to generate specific answers, which are often incorrect. In contrast, when evaluated on multi-granularity answers, DRAG yields a nearly 20 point increase in accuracy on average, which further increases for rare entities. Overall, this reveals that standard evaluation and decoding schemes may significantly underestimate the knowledge encapsulated in LMs."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.365	Gal Yona, Roee Aharoni, Mor Geva
PixT3: Pixel-based Table-To-Text Generation	Table-to-text generation involves generating appropriate textual descriptions given structured tabular data. It has attracted increasing attention in recent years thanks to the popularity of neural network models and the availability of large-scale datasets. A common feature across existing methods is their treatment of the input as a string, i.e., by employing linearization techniques that do not always preserve information in the table, are verbose, and lack space efficiency. We propose to rethink data-to-text generation as a visual recognition task, removing the need for rendering the input in a string format. We present PixT3, a multimodal table-to-text model that overcomes the challenges of linearization and input size limitations encountered by existing models. PixT3 is trained with a new self-supervised learning objective to reinforce table structure awareness and is applicable to open-ended and controlled generation settings. Experiments on the ToTTo and Logic2Text benchmarks show that PixT3 is competitive and, in some settings, superior to generators that operate solely on text.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.364	Iñigo Alonso, Eneko Agirre, Mirella Lapata
SwapMoE: Serving Off-the-shelf MoE-based Large Language Models with Tunable Memory Budget	Mixture of experts (MoE) is a popular technique to improve capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) with conditionally-activated parallel experts. However, serving MoE models on memory-constrained devices is challenging due to the large parameter size. Typical solutions such as memory swapping or expert pruning may lead to significantly higher latency or severe accuracy loss.In this paper, we introduce SwapMoE, a framework for efficient serving of MoE-based large language models with tunable memory budgets. The main idea of SwapMoE is to keep a small dynamic set of important experts, namely Virtual Experts, in the main memory for inference, while seamlessly maintaining how the Virtual Experts map to the actual experts. Experiments have shown that SwapMoE can reduce the memory footprint while maintaining reasonable accuracy. For example, on text summarization tasks with Switch Transformer, SwapMoE can reduce the memory consumption from 14.2 GiB to 4.7 GiB, together with 50% latency reduction and a slight Rouge-2 score drop of 0.041.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.363	Rui Kong, Yuanchun Li, Qingtian Feng, Weijun Wang, Xiaozhou Ye, Ye Ouyang, Linghe Kong, Yunxin Liu
Decoupled Vocabulary Learning Enables Zero-Shot Translation from Unseen Languages	Multilingual neural machine translation systems learn to map sentences of different languages into a common representation space. Intuitively, with a growing number of seen languages the encoder sentence representation grows more flexible and easily adaptable to new languages. In this work, we test this hypothesis by zero-shot translating from unseen languages. To deal with unknown vocabularies from unknown languages we propose a setup where we decouple learning of vocabulary and syntax, i.e. for each language we learn word representations in a separate step (using cross-lingual word embeddings), and then train to translate while keeping those word representations frozen. We demonstrate that this setup enables zero-shot translation from entirely unseen languages. Zero-shot translating with a model trained on Germanic and Romance languages we achieve scores of 42.6 BLEU for Portuguese-English and 20.7 BLEU for Russian-English on TED domain. We explore how this zero-shot translation capability develops with varying number of languages seen by the encoder. Lastly, we explore the effectiveness of our decoupled learning strategy for unsupervised machine translation. By exploiting our model's zero-shot translation capability for iterative back-translation we attain near parity with a supervised setting.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.362	Carlos Mullov, Quan Pham, Alexander Waibel

GroundingGPT: Language Enhanced Multi-modal Grounding Model	Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks. However, these models often prioritize capturing global information and overlook the importance of perceiving local information. This limitation hinders their ability to effectively understand fine-grained details and handle grounding tasks that necessitate nuanced comprehension. Although some recent works have made strides in this, they have primarily focused on single-modality inputs. Therefore, we propose GroundingGPT, an end-to-end language enhanced multi-modal grounding model. It is designed to perform fine-grained grounding tasks for three modalities: image, video and audio. To enhance the model's performance, we adopt a coarse-to-fine training strategy, utilizing a three-stage training approach to progressively enhance the model's semantic awareness and fine-grained understanding capabilities. Additionally, we employ a diversified stage-specific dataset construction pipeline, developing a multi-modal, multi-granularity dataset tailored for training the model in different stages. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves impressive fine-grained understanding of multi-modal inputs on grounding tasks while maintaining or improving its global comprehension capabilities.

RetinaQA: A Robust Knowledge Base Question Answering Model for both Answerable and Unanswerable Questions	An essential requirement for a real-world Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) system is the ability to detect the answerability of questions when generating logical forms. However, state-of-the-art KBQA models assume all questions to be answerable. Recent research has found that such models, when superficially adapted to detect answerability, struggle to satisfactorily identify the different categories of unanswerable questions, and simultaneously preserve good performance for answerable questions. Towards addressing this issue, we propose RetinaQA, a new KBQA model that unifies two key ideas in a single KBQA architecture: (a) discrimination over candidate logical forms, rather than generating these, for handling schema-related unanswerability, and (b) sketch-filling-based construction of candidate logical forms for handling data-related unaswerability. Our results show that RetinaQA significantly outperforms adaptations of state-of-the-art KBQA models in handling both answerable and unanswerable questions and demonstrates robustness across all categories of unanswerability. Notably, RetinaQA also sets a new state-of-the-art for answerable KBQA, surpassing existing models. We release our code base for further research: https://github.com/dair-iitd/RetinaQA.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.359	Prayushi Faldu, Indrajit Bhattacharya, Mausam .
Advancing Large Language Models to Capture Varied Speaking Styles and Respond Properly in Spoken Conversations	"In spoken dialogue, even if two current turns are the same sentence, their responses might still differ when they are spoken in different styles. The spoken styles, containing paralinguistic and prosodic information, mark the most significant difference between text and speech modality. When using text-only LLMs to model spoken dialogue, text-only LLMs cannot give different responses based on the speaking style of the current turn. In this paper, we focus on enabling LLMs to listen to the speaking styles and respond properly. Our goal is to teach the LLM that ""even if the sentences are identical if they are spoken in different styles, their corresponding responses might be different"". Since there is no suitable dataset for achieving this goal, we collect a speech-to-speech dataset, StyleTalk, with the following desired characteristics: when two current speeches have the same content but are spoken in different styles, their responses will be different. To teach LLMs to understand and respond properly to the speaking styles, we propose the Spoken-LLM framework that can model the linguistic content and the speaking styles. We train Spoken-LLM using the StyleTalk dataset and devise a two-stage training pipeline to help the Spoken-LLM better learn the speaking styles. Based on extensive experiments, we show that Spoken-LLM outperforms text-only baselines and prior speech LLMs methods."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.358	Guan-Ting Lin, Cheng-Han Chiang, Hung-yi Lee
A Ship of Theseus: Curious Cases of Paraphrasing in LLM-Generated Texts	In the realm of text manipulation and linguistic transformation, the question of authorship has been a subject of fascination and philosophical inquiry. Much like the Ship of Theseus paradox, which ponders whether a ship remains the same when each of its original planks is replaced, our research delves into an intriguing question: Does a text retain its original authorship when it undergoes numerous paraphrasing iterations? Specifically, since Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in both the generation of original content and the modification of human-authored texts, a pivotal question emerges concerning the determination of authorship in instances where LLMs or similar paraphrasing tools are employed to rephrase the text–i.e., whether authorship should be attributed to the original human author or the AI-powered tool. Therefore, we embark on a philosophical voyage through the seas of language and authorship to unravel this intricate puzzle. Using a computational approach, we discover that the diminishing performance in text classification models, with each successive paraphrasing iteration, is closely associated with the extent of deviation from the original author's style, thus provoking a reconsideration of the current notion of authorship.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.357	Nafis Irtiza Tripto, Saranya Venkatraman, Dominik Macko, Robert Moro, Ivan Srba, Adaku Uchendu, Thai Le, Dongwon Lee
The Hidden Space of Transformer Language Adapters	We analyze the operation of transformer language adapters, which are small modules trained on top of a frozen language model to adapt its predictions to new target languages. We show that adapted predictions mostly evolve in the source language the model was trained on, while the target language becomes pronounced only in the very last layers of the model. Moreover, the adaptation process is gradual and distributed across layers, where it is possible to skip small groups of adapters without decreasing adaptation performance. Last, we show that adapters operate on top of the model's frozen representation space while largely preserving its structure, rather than on an isolated subspace. Our findings provide a deeper view into the adaptation process of language models to new languages, showcasing the constraints imposed on it by the underlying model and introduces practical implications to enhance its efficiency.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.356	Jesujoba Alabi, Marius Mosbach, Matan Eyal, Dietrich Klakow, Mor Geva
SIP: Injecting a Structural Inductive Bias into a Seq2Seq Model by Simulation	Strong inductive biases enable learning from little data and help generalization outside the training distribution. Popular neural architectures such as Transformers lack strong structural inductive biases for seq2seq NLP tasks on their own. Consequently, they struggle with systematic generalization beyond the training distribution, e.g. with extrapolating to longer inputs, even when pre-trained on large amounts of text.We show how a structural inductive bias can be efficiently injected into a seq2seq model by pre-training it to simulate structural transformations on synthetic data. Specifically, we inject an inductive bias towards Finite State Transducers (FSTs) into a Transformer by pre-training it to simulate FSTs given their descriptions. Our experiments show that our method imparts the desired inductive bias, resulting in improved systematic generalization and better few-shot learning for FST-like tasks. Our analysis shows that fine-tuned models accurately capture the state dynamics of the unseen underlying FSTs, suggesting that the simulation process is internalized by the fine-tuned model.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.355	Matthias Lindemann, Alexander Koller, Ivan Titov
A Causal Approach for Counterfactual Reasoning in Narratives	Counterfactual reasoning in narratives requires predicting how alternative conditions, contrary to what actually happened, might have resulted in different outcomes.One major challenge is to maintain the causality between the counterfactual condition and the generated counterfactual outcome. In this paper, we propose a basic VAE module for counterfactual reasoning in narratives. We further introduce a pre-trained classifier and external event commonsense to mitigate the posterior collapse problem in the VAE approach, and improve the causality between the counterfactual condition and the generated counterfactual outcome. We evaluate our method on two public benchmarks. Experiments show that our method is effective.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.354	Feiteng Mu, Wenjie Li
Generating Contrastive Narratives Using the Brownian Bridge Process for Narrative Coherence Learning	A major challenge for narrative reasoning is to learn narrative coherence. Existing works mainly follow the contrastive learning paradigm. However, the negative samples in their methods can be easily distinguished, which makes their methods unsatisfactory. In this work, we devise two strategies for mining hard negatives, including (1) crisscrossing a narrative and its contrastive variants; and (2) event-level replacement. To obtain contrastive variants, we utilize the Brownian Bridge process to guarantee the quality of generated contrastive narratives. We evaluate our model on several tasks. The result proves the effectiveness of our method, and shows that our method is applicable to many applications.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.353	Feiteng Mu, Wenjie Li
LLaMA Pro: Progressive LLaMA with Block Expansion	Humans generally acquire new skills without compromising the old; however, the opposite holds for Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g., from LLaMA to CodeLLaMA. To this end, we propose a new post-pretraining method for LLMs with an expansion of Transformer blocks. We tune the expanded blocks using only new corpus, efficiently and effectively improving the model's knowledge while mitigating forgetting. In this paper, we experiment on the corpus of code and math, yielding LLaMA Pro-8.3B, a versatile foundation model initialized from LLaMA2-7B, excelling in general tasks, programming, and mathematics. LLaMA Pro and its instruction-following counterpart (LLaMA Pro - Instruct) achieve advanced performance among various benchmarks, demonstrating superiority over existing open models in the LLaMA family and the immense potential of reasoning and addressing diverse tasks as an intelligent agent. Our findings provide valuable insights into integrating natural and programming languages, laying a solid foundation for developing advanced language agents that operate effectively in various environments.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.352	Chengyue Wu, Yukang Gan, Yixiao Ge, Zeyu Lu, Jiahao Wang, Ye Feng, Ying Shan, Ping Luo
Benchmarking and Improving Compositional Generalization of Multi-aspect Controllable Text Generation	Compositional generalization, representing the model's ability to generate text with new attribute combinations obtained by recombining single attributes from the training data, is a crucial property for multi-aspect controllable text generation (MCTG) methods. Nonetheless, a comprehensive compositional generalization evaluation benchmark of MCTG is still lacking. We propose CompMCTG, a benchmark encompassing diverse multi-aspect labeled datasets and a crafted three-dimensional evaluation protocol, to holistically evaluate the compositional generalization of MCTG approaches. We observe that existing MCTG works generally confront a noticeable performance drop in compositional testing. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Meta-MCTG, a training framework incorporating meta-learning, where we enable models to learn how to generalize by simulating compositional generalization scenarios in the training phase. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Meta-MCTG through achieving obvious improvement (by at most 3.64%) for compositional testing performance in 94.4%.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.351	Tianqi Zhong, Zhaoyi Li, Quan Wang, Linqi Song, Ying Wei, Defu Lian, Zhendong Mao
Legal Case Retrieval: A Survey of the State of the Art	Recent years have seen increasing attention on Legal Case Retrieval (LCR), a key task in the area of Legal AI that concerns the retrieval of cases from a large legal database of historical cases that are similar to a given query. This paper presents a survey of the major milestones made in LCR research, targeting researchers who are finding their way into the field and seek a brief account of the relevant datasets and the recent neural models and their performances.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.350	Yi Feng, Chuanyi Li, Vincent Ng
DiFiNet: Boundary-Aware Semantic Differentiation and Filtration Network for Nested Named Entity Recognition	Nested Named Entity Recognition (Nested NER) entails identifying and classifying entity spans within the text, including the detection of named entities that are embedded within external entities. Prior approaches primarily employ span-based techniques, utilizing the power of exhaustive searches to address the challenge of overlapping entities. Nonetheless, these methods often grapple with the absence of explicit guidance for boundary detection, resulting insensitivity in discerning minor variations within nested spans. To this end, we propose a Boundary-aware Semantic ̲Di fferentiation and ̲Fi ltration ̲Net work (DiFiNet) tailored for nested NER. Specifically, DiFiNet leverages a biaffine attention mechanism to generate a span representation matrix. This matrix undergoes further refinement through a self-adaptive semantic differentiation module, specifically engineered to discern semantic variances across spans. Furthermore, DiFiNet integrates a boundary filtration module, designed to mitigate the impact of non-entity noise by leveraging semantic relations among spans. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate our model yields a new state-of-the-art performance.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.349	Yuxiang Cai, Qiao Liu, Yanglei Gan, Run Lin, Changlin Li, Xueyi Liu, Da Luo, JiayeYang JiayeYang
Error-preserving Automatic Speech Recognition of Young English Learners’ Language	One of the central skills that language learners need to practice is speaking the language. Currently, students in school do not get enough speaking opportunities and lack conversational practice. The recent advances in speech technology and natural language processing allow the creation of novel tools to practice their speaking skills. In this work, we tackle the first component of such a pipeline, namely, the automated speech recognition module (ASR). State-of-the-art models are often trained on adult read-aloud data by native speakers and do not transfer well to young language learners' speech. Second, most ASR systems contain a powerful language model, which smooths out mistakes made by the speakers. To give corrective feedback, which is a crucial part of language learning, the ASR systems in our setting need to preserve the mistakes made by the language learners. In this work, we build an ASR system that satisfies these requirements: it works on spontaneous speech by young language learners and preserves their mistakes. For this, we collected a corpus containing around 85 hours of English audio spoken by Swiss learners from grades 4 to 6 on different language learning tasks, which we used to train an ASR model. Our experiments show that our model benefits from direct fine-tuning of children's voices and has a much higher error preservation rate.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.348	Janick Michot, Manuela Hürlimann, Jan Deriu, Luzia Sauer, Katsiaryna Mlynchyk, Mark Cieliebak
WRP: Weight Recover Prune for Structured Sparsity	As the scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) increases, it is necessary to compress the models to reduce the substantial demand on computational resources. Network pruning significantly reduces the model size by converting the weight matrix from dense to sparse data format. Current methodologies advocate for one-shot pruning to avoid the expense of retraining, ensuring the maintenance of model performance under conditions of 50%-60% unstructured pruning. Nevertheless, matrices characterized by this level of sparsity could not be treated as sparse matrices, because the indices would incur significant costs. To mitigate this problem, NVIDIA introduced the 2:4 structured sparsity. However, we observe a notable decline in model performance when adopting 2:4 structured sparsity due to group constraints. In this paper, we introduce the Weight Recover Prune (WRP) approach. By recovering a minimal set of critical weights, WRP aims to enhance model performance while maintaining the efficiency of the compression. Our evaluation of the WRP method on the LLAMA2 and OPT models shows that it outperforms other 2:4 pattern one-shot pruning methods. Meanwhile, WRP can guarantee that the size of the pruned model is about 60% of the dense model. Our code is available at: https://github.com/TanZhendong/WRP.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.347	Zhendong Tan, Xingjun Zhang, Zheng Wei
Self-Evolving GPT: A Lifelong Autonomous Experiential Learner	To improve the performance of large language models (LLMs), researchers have explored providing LLMs with textual task-solving experience via prompts. However, they rely on manual efforts to acquire and apply such experience for each task, which is not feasible for the growing demand for LLMs and the variety of user questions.To address this issue, we design a lifelong autonomous experiential learning framework based on LLMs to explore whether LLMs can imitate human ability for learning and utilizing experience. It autonomously learns and accumulates experience through experience transfer and induction, categorizing the types of input questions to select which accumulated experience to employ for them.Experimental results on six widely used NLP datasets show that our framework performs reliably in each intermediate step and effectively improves the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. This validates the feasibility of using LLMs to mimic human experiential learning and application capabilities, offering a new path worth further exploration for the evolution of machine intelligence. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of the behavior of our framework at each step.We will open source codes after the acceptance, fostering open research in the NLP community and beyond.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.346	Jinglong Gao, Xiao Ding, Yiming Cui, Jianbai Zhao, Hepeng Wang, Ting Liu, Bing Qin
Not All Countries Celebrate Thanksgiving: On the Cultural Dominance in Large Language Models	This paper identifies a cultural dominance issue within large language models (LLMs) due to the predominant use of English data in model training (e.g., ChatGPT). LLMs often provide inappropriate English-culture-related answers that are not relevant to the expected culture when users ask in non-English languages. To systematically evaluate the cultural dominance issue, we build a benchmark of concrete (e.g., holidays and songs) and abstract (e.g., values and opinions) cultural objects. Empirical results show that the representative GPT models suffer from the culture dominance problem, where GPT-4 is the most affected while text-davinci-003 suffers the least from this problem. Our study emphasizes the need to critically examine cultural dominance and ethical considerations in their development and deployment. We show that two straightforward methods in model development (i.e., pretraining on more diverse data) and deployment (e.g., culture-aware prompting) can significantly mitigate the cultural dominance issue in LLMs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.345	Wenxuan Wang, Wenxiang Jiao, Jingyuan Huang, Ruyi Dai, Jen-tse Huang, Zhaopeng Tu, Michael Lyu
Exploring Alignment in Shared Cross-lingual Spaces	Despite their remarkable ability to capture linguistic nuances across diverse languages, questions persist regarding the degree of alignment between languages in multilingual embeddings. Drawing inspiration from research on high-dimensional representations in neural language models, we employ clustering to uncover latent concepts within multilingual models. Our analysis focuses on quantifying the alignment and overlap of these concepts across various languages within the latent space. To this end, we introduce two metrics CALIGN and COLAP aimed at quantifying these aspects, enabling a deeper exploration of multilingual embeddings. Our study encompasses three multilingual models (mT5, mBERT, and XLM-R) and three downstream tasks (Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition, and Sentiment Analysis). Key findings from our analysis include: i) deeper layers in the network demonstrate increased cross-lingual alignment due to the presence of language-agnostic concepts, ii) fine-tuning of the models enhances alignment within the latent space, and iii) such task-specific calibration helps in explaining the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in the models.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.344	Basel Mousi, Nadir Durrani, Fahim Dalvi, Majd Hawasly, Ahmed Abdelali
Unlearning Traces the Influential Training Data of Language Models	Identifying the training datasets that influence a language model's outputs is essential for minimizing the generation of harmful content and enhancing its performance. Ideally, we can measure the influence of each dataset by removing it from training; however, it is prohibitively expensive to retrain a model multiple times. This paper presents UnTrac: unlearning traces the influence of a training dataset on the model's performance. UnTrac is extremely simple; each training dataset is unlearned by gradient ascent, and we evaluate how much the model's predictions change after unlearning. Furthermore, we propose a more scalable approach, UnTrac-Inv, which unlearns a test dataset and evaluates the unlearned model on training datasets. UnTrac-Inv resembles UnTrac, while being efficient for massive training datasets. In the experiments, we examine if our methods can assess the influence of pretraining datasets on generating toxic, biased, and untruthful content. Our methods estimate their influence much more accurately than existing methods while requiring neither excessive memory space nor multiple checkpoints.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.343	Masaru Isonuma, Ivan Titov
An Open Multilingual System for Scoring Readability of Wikipedia	With over 60M articles, Wikipedia has become the largest platform for open and freely accessible knowledge. While it has more than 15B monthly visits, its content is believed to be inaccessible to many readers due to the lack of readability of its text. However, previous investigations of the readability of Wikipedia have been restricted to English only, and there are currently no systems supporting the automatic readability assessment of the 300+ languages in Wikipedia. To bridge this gap, we develop a multilingual model to score the readability of Wikipedia articles. To train and evaluate this model, we create a novel multilingual dataset spanning 14 languages, by matching articles from Wikipedia to simplified Wikipedia and online children encyclopedias. We show that our model performs well in a zero-shot scenario, yielding a ranking accuracy of more than 80% across 14 languages and improving upon previous benchmarks. These results demonstrate the applicability of the model at scale for languages in which there is no ground-truth data available for model fine-tuning. Furthermore, we provide the first overview on the state of readability in Wikipedia beyond English.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.342	Mykola Trokhymovych, Indira Sen, Martin Gerlach
Discursive Socratic Questioning: Evaluating the Faithfulness of Language Models’ Understanding of Discourse Relations	While large language models have significantly enhanced the effectiveness of discourse relation classifications, it remains unclear whether their comprehension is faithful and reliable. We provide DiSQ, a new method for evaluating the faithfulness of understanding discourse based on question answering. We first employ in-context learning to annotate the reasoning for discourse comprehension, based on the connections among key events within the discourse. Following this, DiSQ interrogates the model with a sequence of questions to assess its grasp of core event relations, its resilience to counterfactual queries, as well as its consistency to its previous responses. then evaluate language models with different architectural designs using DiSQ, finding: (1) DiSQ presents a significant challenge for all models, with the top-performing GPT model attaining only 41% of the ideal performance in PDTB; (2) DiSQ is robust to domain shifts and paraphrase variations; (3) Open-source models generally lag behind their closed-source GPT counterparts, with notable exceptions being those enhanced with chat and code/math features; (4) Our analysis validates the effectiveness of explicitly signalled discourse connectives, the role of contextual information, and the benefits of using historical QA data.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.341	Yisong Miao, Hongfu Liu, Wenqiang Lei, Nancy Chen, Min-Yen Kan
FastFiD: Improve Inference Efficiency of Open Domain Question Answering via Sentence Selection	Open Domain Question Answering (ODQA) has been advancing rapidly in recent times, driven by significant developments in dense passage retrieval and pretrained language models. State-of-the-art models typically incorporate the FiD framework, which is composed by a neural retriever alongside an encoder-decoder neural reader. In the answer generation process, the retriever will retrieve numerous passages (around 100 for instance), each of which is then individually encoded by the encoder. Subsequently, the decoder makes predictions based on these encoded passages. Nevertheless, this framework can be relatively time-consuming, particularly due to the extensive length of the gathered passages. To address this, we introduce FastFiD in this paper, a novel approach that executes sentence selection on the encoded passages. This aids in retaining valuable sentences while reducing the context length required for generating answers. Experiments on three commonly used datasets (Natural Questions, TriviaQA and ASQA) demonstrate that our method can enhance the inference speed by **2.3X-5.7X**, while simultaneously maintaining the model's performance. Moreover, an in-depth analysis of the model's attention reveals that the selected sentences indeed hold a substantial contribution towards the final answer. The codes are publicly available at https://github.com/thunlp/FastFiD.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.340	Yufei Huang, Xu Han, Maosong Sun
Text-to-Song: Towards Controllable Music Generation Incorporating Vocal and Accompaniment	A song is a combination of singing voice and accompaniment. However, existing works focus on singing voice synthesis and music generation independently. Little attention was paid to exploring song synthesis. In this work, we propose a novel task called Text-to-Song synthesis which incorporates both vocal and accompaniment generation. We develop Melodist, a two-stage text-to-song method that consists of singing voice synthesis (SVS) and vocal-to-accompaniment (V2A) synthesis. Melodist leverages tri-tower contrastive pretraining to learn more effective text representation for controllable V2A synthesis. A Chinese song dataset mined from a music website is built to alleviate data scarcity for our research. The evaluation results on our dataset demonstrate that Melodist can synthesize songs with comparable quality and style consistency. Audio samples can be found in https://text2songMelodist.github.io/Sample/.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.339	Zhiqing Hong, Rongjie Huang, Xize Cheng, Yongqi Wang, Ruiqi Li, Fuming You, Zhou Zhao, Zhimeng Zhang
Unveiling Linguistic Regions in Large Language Models	Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable cross-lingual alignment and generalization ability. Current research primarily focuses on improving LLMs' cross-lingual generalization capabilities. However, there is still a lack of research on the intrinsic mechanisms of how LLMs achieve cross-lingual alignment. From the perspective of region partitioning, this paper conducts several investigations on the linguistic competence of LLMs. We discover a core region in LLMs that corresponds to linguistic competence, accounting for approximately 1% of the total model parameters. Removing this core region by setting parameters to zero results in a significant performance decrease across 30 different languages. Furthermore, this core region exhibits significant dimensional dependence, perturbations to even a single parameter on specific dimensions leading to a loss of linguistic competence. Moreover, we discover that distinct monolingual regions exist for different languages, and disruption to these specific regions substantially reduces the LLMs' proficiency in those corresponding languages. Our research also indicates that freezing the core linguistic region during further pre-training can mitigate the issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF), a common phenomenon observed during further pre-training of LLMs. Overall, exploring the LLMs' functional regions provides insights into the foundation of their intelligence.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.338	Zhihao Zhang, Jun Zhao, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui, Xuanjing Huang
Blinded by Generated Contexts: How Language Models Merge Generated and Retrieved Contexts When Knowledge Conflicts?	While auxiliary information has become a key to enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), relatively little is known about how LLMs merge these contexts, specifically contexts generated by LLMs and those retrieved from external sources.To investigate this, we formulate a systematic framework to identify whether LLMs' responses are attributed to either generated or retrieved contexts.To easily trace the origin of the response, we construct datasets with conflicting contexts, i.e., each question is paired with both generated and retrieved contexts, yet only one of them contains the correct answer.Our experiments reveal a significant bias in several LLMs (GPT-4/3.5 and Llama2) to favor generated contexts, even when they provide incorrect information.We further identify two key factors contributing to this bias: i) contexts generated by LLMs typically show greater similarity to the questions, increasing their likelihood of being selected; ii) the segmentation process used in retrieved contexts disrupts their completeness, thereby hindering their full utilization in LLMs.Our analysis enhances the understanding of how LLMs merge diverse contexts, offers valuable insights for advancing current LLM augmentation methods, and highlights the risk of generated misinformation for retrieval-augmented LLMs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.337	Hexiang Tan, Fei Sun, Wanli Yang, Yuanzhuo Wang, Qi Cao, Xueqi Cheng
The Fine-Tuning Paradox: Boosting Translation Quality Without Sacrificing LLM Abilities	Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for machine translation has shown improvements in overall translation quality. However, it is unclear what is the impact of fine-tuning on desirable LLM behaviors that are not present in neural machine translation models, such as steerability, inherent document-level translation abilities, and the ability to produce less literal translations. We perform an extensive translation evaluation on the LLaMA and Falcon family of models with model size ranging from 7 billion up to 65 billion parameters.Our results show that while fine-tuning improves the general translation quality of LLMs, several abilities degrade. In particular, we observe a decline in the ability to perform formality steering, to produce technical translations through few-shot examples, and to perform document-level translation. On the other hand, we observe that the model produces less literal translations after fine-tuning on parallel data. We show that by including monolingual data as part of the fine-tuning data we can maintain the abilities while simultaneously enhancing overall translation quality. Our findings emphasize the need for fine-tuning strategies that preserve the benefits of LLMs for machine translation.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.336	David Stap, Eva Hasler, Bill Byrne, Christof Monz, Ke Tran
UNIMO-G: Unified Image Generation through Multimodal Conditional Diffusion	Existing text-to-image diffusion models primarily generate images from text prompts. However, the inherent conciseness of textual descriptions poses challenges in faithfully synthesizing images with intricate details, such as specific entities or scenes. This paper presents UNIMO-G, a simple multimodal conditional diffusion framework that operates on multimodal prompts with interleaved textual and visual inputs, which demonstrates a unified ability for both text-driven and subject-driven image generation. UNIMO-G comprises two core components: a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for encoding multimodal prompts, and a conditional denoising diffusion network for generating images based on the encoded multimodal input. We leverage a two-stage training strategy to effectively train the framework: firstly pre-training on large-scale text-image pairs to develop conditional image generation capabilities, and then instruction tuning with multimodal prompts to achieve unified image generation proficiency. A well-designed data processing pipeline involving language grounding and image segmentation is employed to construct multi-modal prompts. UNIMO-G excels in both text-to-image generation and zero-shot subject-driven synthesis, and is notably effective in generating high-fidelity images from complex multimodal prompts involving multiple image entities.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.335	Wei Li, Xue Xu, Jiachen Liu, Xinyan Xiao
Not All Experts are Equal: Efficient Expert Pruning and Skipping for Mixture-of-Experts Large Language Models	A pivotal advancement in the progress of large language models (LLMs) is the emergence of the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs. Compared to traditional LLMs, MoE LLMs can achieve higher performance with fewer active parameters, but it is still hard to deploy them due to their immense parameter sizes. Different from previous weight pruning methods that rely on specifically designed hardware, this paper mainly aims to enhance the deployment efficiency of MoE LLMs by introducing plug-and-play expert-level sparsification techniques. Specifically, we propose, for the first time to our best knowledge, post-training approaches for task-agnostic and task-specific expert pruning and skipping of MoE LLMs, tailored to improve deployment efficiency while maintaining model performance across a wide range of tasks. Extensive experiments show that our proposed methods can simultaneously reduce model sizes and increase the inference speed, while maintaining satisfactory performance.

TasTe: Teaching Large Language Models to Translate through Self-Reflection	Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks. Techniques like instruction tuning have effectively enhanced the proficiency of LLMs in the downstream task of machine translation. However, the existing approaches fail to yield satisfactory translation outputs that match the quality of supervised neural machine translation (NMT) systems. One plausible explanation for this discrepancy is that the straightforward prompts employed in these methodologies are unable to fully exploit the acquired instruction-following capabilities. To this end, we propose the TasTe framework, which stands for translating through self-reflection. The self-reflection process includes two stages of inference. In the first stage, LLMs are instructed to generate preliminary translations and conduct self-assessments on these translations simultaneously. In the second stage, LLMs are tasked to refine these preliminary translations according to the evaluation results. The evaluation results in four language directions on the WMT22 benchmark reveal the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing methods. Our work presents a promising approach to unleash the potential of LLMs and enhance their capabilities in MT. The codes and datasets are open-sourced at https://github.com/YutongWang1216/ReflectionLLMMT.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.333	Yutong Wang, Jiali Zeng, Xuebo Liu, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Min Zhang
Soft Knowledge Prompt: Help External Knowledge Become a Better Teacher to Instruct LLM in Knowledge-based VQA	LLM has achieved impressive performance on multi-modal tasks, which have received ever-increasing research attention. Recent research focuses on improving prediction performance and reliability (e.g., addressing the hallucination problem). They often prepend relevant external knowledge to the input text as an extra prompt. However, these methods would be affected by the noise in the knowledge and the context length limitation of LLM. In our work, we focus on making better use of external knowledge and propose a method to actively extract valuable information in the knowledge to produce the latent vector as a soft prompt, which is then fused with the image embedding to form a knowledge-enhanced context to instruct LLM. The experimental results on knowledge-based VQA benchmarks show that the proposed method enjoys better utilization of external knowledge and helps the model achieve better performance.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.332	Qunbo Wang, Ruyi Ji, Tianhao Peng, Wenjun Wu, Zechao Li, Jing Liu
Rethinking the Bounds of LLM Reasoning: Are Multi-Agent Discussions the Key?	"Recent progress in LLMs discussion suggests that multi-agent discussion improves the reasoning abilities of LLMs. In this work, we reevaluate this claim through systematic experiments, where we propose a novel group discussion framework to enrich the set of discussion mechanisms. Interestingly, our results show that a single-agent LLM with strong prompts can achieve almost the same best performance as the best existing discussion approach on a wide range of reasoning tasks and backbone LLMs. We observed that the multi-agent discussion performs better than a single agent only when there is no demonstration in the prompt. Further study reveals the common interaction mechanisms of LLMs during the discussion.

Learning or Self-aligning? Rethinking Instruction Fine-tuning	Instruction Fine-tuning (IFT) is a crucial phase in building large language models (LLMs). Previous works mainly focus on the IFT's role in the transfer of behavioral norms and the learning of additional world knowledge. However, the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of IFT remains significantly limited. In this paper, we design a knowledge intervention framework to decouple the potential underlying factors of IFT, thereby enabling individual analysis of different factors. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that attempting to learn additional world knowledge through IFT often struggles to yield positive impacts and can even lead to markedly negative effects. Further, we discover that maintaining internal knowledge consistency before and after IFT is a critical factor for achieving successful IFT. Our findings reveal the underlying mechanisms of IFT and provide robust support for some very recent and potential future works.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.330	Mengjie Ren, Boxi Cao, Hongyu Lin, Cao Liu, Xianpei Han, Ke Zeng, Wan Guanglu, Xunliang Cai, Le Sun
On Measuring Faithfulness or Self-consistency of Natural Language Explanations	Large language models (LLMs) can explain their predictions through post-hoc or Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations. But an LLM could make up reasonably sounding explanations that are unfaithful to its underlying reasoning. Recent work has designed tests that aim to judge the faithfulness of post-hoc or CoT explanations. In this work we argue that these faithfulness tests do not measure faithfulness to the models' inner workings – but rather their self-consistency at output level.Our contributions are three-fold: i) We clarify the status of faithfulness tests in view of model explainability, characterising them as self-consistency tests instead. This assessment we underline by ii) constructing a Comparative Consistency Bank for self-consistency tests that for the first time compares existing tests on a common suite of 11 open LLMs and 5 tasks – including iii) our new self-consistency measure CC-SHAP. CC-SHAP is a fine-grained measure (not a test) of LLM self-consistency. It compares how a model's input contributes to the predicted answer and to generating the explanation. Our fine-grained CC-SHAP metric allows us iii) to compare LLM behaviour when making predictions and to analyse the effect of other consistency tests at a deeper level, which takes us one step further towards measuring faithfulness by bringing us closer to the internals of the model than strictly surface output-oriented tests.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.329	Letitia Parcalabescu, Anette Frank
FinTextQA: A Dataset for Long-form Financial Question Answering	Accurate evaluation of financial question answering (QA) systems necessitates a comprehensive dataset encompassing diverse question types and contexts. However, current financial QA datasets lack scope diversity and question complexity. This work introduces FinTextQA, a novel dataset for long-form question answering (LFQA) in finance. FinTextQA comprises 1,262 high-quality, source-attributed QA pairs extracted and selected from finance textbooks and government agency websites.Moreover, we developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based LFQA system, comprising an embedder, retriever, reranker, and generator. A multi-faceted evaluation approach, including human ranking, automatic metrics, and GPT-4 scoring, was employed to benchmark the performance of different LFQA system configurations under heightened noisy conditions. The results indicate that: (1) Among all compared generators, Baichuan2-7B competes closely with GPT-3.5-turbo in accuracy score; (2) The most effective system configuration on our dataset involved setting the embedder, retriever, reranker, and generator as Ada2, Automated Merged Retrieval, Bge-Reranker-Base, and Baichuan2-7B, respectively; (3) models are less susceptible to noise after the length of contexts reaching a specific threshold.

Are AI-Generated Text Detectors Robust to Adversarial Perturbations?	"The widespread use of large language models (LLMs) has sparked concerns about the potential misuse of AI-generated text, as these models can produce content that closely resembles human-generated text. Current detectors for AI-generated text (AIGT) lack robustness against adversarial perturbations, with even minor changes in characters or words causing a reversal in distinguishing between human-created and AI-generated text. This paper investigates the robustness of existing AIGT detection methods and introduces a novel detector, the Siamese Calibrated Reconstruction Network (SCRN). The SCRN employs a reconstruction network to add and remove noise from text, extracting a semantic representation that is robust to local perturbations. We also propose a siamese calibration technique to train the model to make equally confident predictions under different noise, which improves the model's robustness against adversarial perturbations. Experiments on four publicly available datasets show that the SCRN outperforms all baseline methods, achieving 6.5%-18.25% absolute accuracy improvement over the best baseline method under adversarial attacks. Moreover, it exhibits superior generalizability in cross-domain, cross-genre, and mixed-source scenarios.

EmoBench: Evaluating the Emotional Intelligence of Large Language Models	Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the need for robust, comprehensive, and challenging benchmarks. Yet, research on evaluating their Emotional Intelligence (EI) is considerably limited. Existing benchmarks have two major shortcomings: first, they mainly focus on emotion recognition, neglecting essential EI capabilities such as emotion management and thought facilitation through emotion understanding; second, they are primarily constructed from existing datasets, which include frequent patterns, explicit information, and annotation errors, leading to unreliable evaluation. We propose EmoBench, a benchmark that draws upon established psychological theories and proposes a comprehensive definition for machine EI, including Emotional Understanding and Emotional Application. EmoBench includes a set of 400 hand-crafted questions in English and Chinese, which are meticulously designed to require thorough reasoning and understanding. Our findings reveal a considerable gap between the EI of existing LLMs and the average human, highlighting a promising direction for future research.

KIEval: A Knowledge-grounded Interactive Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models	"Automatic evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) are hindered by data contamination, leading to inflated assessments of their effectiveness. Existing strategies, which aim to detect contaminated texts, focus on quantifying contamination status instead of accurately gauging model performance. In this paper, we introduce KIEval, a Knowledge-grounded Interactive Evaluation framework, which incorporates an LLM-powered ""interactor"" role for the first time to accomplish a dynamic contamination-resilient evaluation. Starting with a question in a conventional LLM benchmark involving domain-specific knowledge, KIEval utilizes dynamically generated, multi-round, and knowledge-focused dialogues to determine whether a model's response is merely a recall of benchmark answers or demonstrates a deep comprehension to apply knowledge in more complex conversations. Extensive experiments on seven leading LLMs across five datasets validate KIEval's effectiveness and generalization. We also reveal that data contamination brings no contribution or even negative effect to models' real-world applicability and understanding, and existing contamination detection methods for LLMs can only identify contamination in pre-training but not during supervised fine-tuning."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.325	Zhuohao Yu, Chang Gao, Wenjin Yao, Yidong Wang, Wei Ye, Jindong Wang, Xing Xie, Yue Zhang, Shikun Zhang
ProtT3: Protein-to-Text Generation for Text-based Protein Understanding	Language Models (LMs) excel in understanding textual descriptions of proteins, as evident in biomedical question-answering tasks. However, their capability falters with raw protein data, such as amino acid sequences, due to a deficit in pretraining on such data. Conversely, Protein Language Models (PLMs) can understand and convert protein data into high-quality representations, but struggle to process texts. To address their limitations, we introduce ProtT3, a framework for Protein-to-Text Generation for Text-based Protein Understanding. ProtT3 empowers an LM to understand protein sequences of amino acids by incorporating a PLM as its protein understanding module, enabling effective protein-to-text generation. This collaboration between PLM and LM is facilitated by a cross-modal projector (i.e., Q-Former) that bridges the modality gap between the PLM's representation space and the LM's input space. Unlike previous studies focusing on protein property prediction and protein-text retrieval, we delve into the largely unexplored field of protein-to-text generation. To facilitate comprehensive benchmarks and promote future research, we establish quantitative evaluations for protein-text modeling tasks, including protein captioning, protein question-answering, and protein-text retrieval. Our experiments show that ProtT3 substantially surpasses current baselines, with ablation studies further highlighting the efficacy of its core components. Our code is available at https://github.com/acharkq/ProtT3.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.324	Zhiyuan Liu, An Zhang, Hao Fei, Enzhi Zhang, Xiang Wang, Kenji Kawaguchi, Tat-Seng Chua
SparseFlow: Accelerating Transformers by Sparsifying Information Flows	Transformers have become the de-facto standard for natural language processing. However, dense information flows within transformers pose significant challenges for real-time and resource-constrained devices, as computational complexity grows quadratically with sequence length. To counteract such dense information flows, we propose SparseFlow, a novel efficient method designed to sparsify the dense pathways of token representations across all transformer blocks. To this end, SparseFlow parameterizes the information flows linking token representations to transformer blocks. These parameterized information flows are optimized to be sparse, allowing only the salient information to pass through into the blocks. To validate the efficacy of SparseFlow, we conduct comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks (understanding and generation), scales (ranging from millions to billions), architectures (including encoders, decoders, and seq-to-seq models), and modalities (such as language-only and vision-language). The results convincingly demonstrate that sparsifying the dense information flows leads to substantial speedup gains without compromising task accuracy. For instance, SparseFlow reduces computational costs by half on average, without a significant loss in accuracy.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.323	Yeachan Kim, SangKeun Lee
Towards Robust and Generalized Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Noisy Label Learning	Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has enabled the efficient optimization of cumbersome language models in real-world settings. However, as datasets in such environments often contain noisy labels that adversely affect performance, PEFT methods are inevitably exposed to noisy labels. Despite this challenge, the adaptability of PEFT to noisy environments remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we investigate various PEFT methods under noisy labels. Interestingly, our findings reveal that PEFT has difficulty in memorizing noisy labels due to its inherently limited capacity, resulting in robustness. However, we also find that such limited capacity simultaneously makes PEFT more vulnerable to interference of noisy labels, impeding the learning of clean samples. To address this issue, we propose Clean Routing (CleaR), a novel routing-based PEFT approach that adaptively activates PEFT modules. In CleaR, PEFT modules are preferentially exposed to clean data while bypassing the noisy ones, thereby minimizing the noisy influence. To verify the efficacy of CleaR, we perform extensive experiments on diverse configurations of noisy labels. The results convincingly demonstrate that CleaR leads to substantially improved performance in noisy environments	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.322	Yeachan Kim, Junho Kim, SangKeun Lee
SEER: Facilitating Structured Reasoning and Explanation via Reinforcement Learning	Elucidating the reasoning process with structured explanations from question to answer is crucial, as it significantly enhances the interpretability, traceability, and trustworthiness of question-answering (QA) systems. However, structured explanations demand models to perform intricately structured reasoning, which poses great challenges. Most existing methods focus on single-step reasoning through supervised learning, ignoring logical dependencies between steps. Moreover, existing reinforcement learning (RL) based methods overlook the structured relationships, underutilizing the potential of RL in structured reasoning. In this paper, we propose SEER, a novel method that maximizes a structure-based return to facilitate structured reasoning and explanation. Our proposed structure-based return precisely describes the hierarchical and branching structure inherent in structured reasoning, effectively capturing the intricate relationships between different reasoning steps. In addition, we introduce a fine-grained reward function to meticulously delineate diverse reasoning steps. Extensive experiments show that SEER significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an absolute improvement of 6.9% over RL-based methods on EntailmentBank, a 4.4% average improvement on STREET benchmark, and exhibiting outstanding efficiency and cross-dataset generalization performance.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.321	Guoxin Chen, Kexin Tang, Chao Yang, Fuying Ye, Yu Qiao, Yiming Qian
Masked Thought: Simply Masking Partial Reasoning Steps Can Improve Mathematical Reasoning Learning of Language Models	In reasoning tasks, even a minor error can cascade into inaccurate results, leading to suboptimal performance of large language models insuch domains. Earlier fine-tuning approaches sought to mitigate this by leveraging more precise supervisory signals from human labeling, larger models, or self-sampling, although at a high cost. Conversely, we develop a method that avoids external resources, relying instead on introducing perturbations to the input. Our training approach randomly masks certain tokens within the chain of thought, a techniquewe found to be particularly effective for reasoning tasks. When applied to fine-tuning with GSM8K on Llama-2-7B, this method achieveda 5% improvement in GSM8K accuracy and a 10% improvement in GSM-IC accuracy over standard supervised fine-tuning with a few codes modified. Furthermore, it is complementary to existing methods. When integrated with related explicit data augmentation methods, it leads to improvements across five datasets of various augmentation methods, as well as two different base models. We further investigate the mechanisms behind this improvement through case studies and quantitative analysis, suggesting that our approach may provide superior support for the model in capturing long-distance dependencies, especially those related to questions. This enhancement could deepen understanding of the premises in questions and prior steps.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.320	Changyu Chen, Xiting Wang, Ting-En Lin, Ang Lv, Yuchuan Wu, Xin Gao, Ji-Rong Wen, Rui Yan, Yongbin Li
Multi-Dimensional Optimization for Text Summarization via Reinforcement Learning	The evaluation of summary quality encompasses diverse dimensions such as consistency, coherence, relevance, and fluency. However, existing summarization methods often target a specific dimension, facing challenges in generating well-balanced summaries across multiple dimensions. In this paper, we propose multi-objective reinforcement learning tailored to generate balanced summaries across all four dimensions. We introduce two multi-dimensional optimization (MDO) strategies for adaptive learning: 1) MDO_min, rewarding the current lowest dimension score, and 2) MDO_pro, optimizing multiple dimensions similar to multi-task learning, resolves conflicting gradients across dimensions through gradient projection. Unlike prior ROUGE-based rewards relying on reference summaries, we use a QA-based reward model that aligns with human preferences. Further, we discover the capability to regulate the length of summaries by adjusting the discount factor, seeking the generation of concise yet informative summaries that encapsulate crucial points. Our approach achieved substantial performance gains compared to baseline models on representative summarization datasets, particularly in the overlooked dimensions.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.319	Sangwon Ryu, Heejin Do, Yunsu Kim, Gary Lee, Jungseul Ok
Stealthy Attack on Large Language Model based Recommendation	Recently, the powerful large language models (LLMs) have been instrumental in propelling the progress of recommender systems (RS). However, while these systems have flourished, their susceptibility to security threats has been largely overlooked. In this work, we reveal that the introduction of LLMs into recommendation models presents new security vulnerabilities due to their emphasis on the textual content of items. We demonstrate that attackers can significantly boost an item's exposure by merely altering its textual content during the testing phase, without requiring direct interference with the model's training process. Additionally, the attack is notably stealthy, as it does not affect the overall recommendation performance and the modifications to the text are subtle, making it difficult for users and platforms to detect. Our comprehensive experiments across four mainstream LLM-based recommendation models demonstrate the superior efficacy and stealthiness of our approach. Our work unveils a significant security gap in LLM-based recommendation systems and paves the way for future research on protecting these systems.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.318	Jinghao Zhang, Yuting Liu, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Guibing Guo, Liang Wang
Fine-Grained Modeling of Narrative Context: A Coherence Perspective via Retrospective Questions	This work introduces an original and practical paradigm for narrative comprehension, stemming from the characteristics that individual passages within narratives tend to be more cohesively related than isolated.Complementary to the common end-to-end paradigm, we propose a fine-grained modeling of narrative context, by formulating a graph dubbed NarCo, which explicitly depicts task-agnostic coherence dependencies that are ready to be consumed by various downstream tasks. In particular, edges in NarCo encompass free-form retrospective questions between context snippets, inspired by human cognitive perception that constantly reinstates relevant events from prior context. Importantly, our graph formalism is practically instantiated by LLMs without human annotations, through our designed two-stage prompting scheme.To examine the graph properties and its utility, we conduct three studies in narratives, each from a unique angle: edge relation efficacy, local context enrichment, and broader application in QA. All tasks could benefit from the explicit coherence captured by NarCo.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.317	Liyan Xu, Jiangnan Li, Mo Yu, Jie Zhou
Event-Radar: Event-driven Multi-View Learning for Multimodal Fake News Detection	The swift detection of multimedia fake news has emerged as a crucial task in combating malicious propaganda and safeguarding the security of the online environment. While existing methods have achieved commendable results in modeling entity-level inconsistency, addressing event-level inconsistency following the inherent subject-predicate logic of news and robustly learning news representations from poor-quality news samples remain two challenges. In this paper, we propose an Event-diven fake news detection framework (Event-Radar) based on multi-view learning, which integrates visual manipulation, textual emotion and multimodal inconsistency at event-level for fake news detection. Specifically, leveraging the capability of graph structures to capture interactions between events and parameters, Event-Radar captures event-level multimodal inconsistency by constructing an event graph that includes multimodal entity subject-predicate logic. Additionally, to mitigate the interference of poor-quality news, Event-Radar introduces a multi-view fusion mechanism, learning comprehensive and robust representations by computing the credibility of each view as a clue, thereby detecting fake news. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Event-Radar achieves outstanding performance on three large-scale fake news detection benchmarks. Our studies also confirm that Event-Radar exhibits strong robustness, providing a paradigm for detecting fake news from noisy news samples.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.316	Zihan Ma, Minnan Luo, Hao Guo, Zhi Zeng, Yiran Hao, Xiang Zhao
GumbelSoft: Diversified Language Model Watermarking via the GumbelMax-trick	Large language models (LLMs) excellently generate human-like text, but also raise concerns about misuse in fake news and academic dishonesty. Decoding-based watermark, particularly the watermark based on the GumbelMax trick (GM watermark), is a standout solution for safeguarding machine-generated texts due to its notable detectability. However, GM watermark encounters a major challenge with generation diversity, always yielding identical outputs for the same prompt, negatively impacting generation diversity and user experience. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new type of GM watermark, the Logits-Addition watermark, as well as three variants that aim to enhance diversity, particularly the GumbelSoft watermark (i.e., the softmax variant of the Logits-Addition watermark). When assessed for detectability in high diversity settings, our Gumbelsoft demonstrates superior performance, with its AUROC score exceeding those of the two alternative variants by a margin of 0.1 to 0.3 and outperforming other decoding-based watermarking methods by a minimum of 0.1.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.315	Jiayi Fu, Xuandong Zhao, Ruihan Yang, Yuansen Zhang, Jiangjie Chen, Yanghua Xiao
RepCodec: A Speech Representation Codec for Speech Tokenization	With recent rapid growth of large language models (LLMs), discrete speech tokenization has played an important role for injecting speech into LLMs. However, this discretization gives rise to a loss of information, consequently impairing overall performance. To improve the performance of these discrete speech tokens, we present RepCodec, a novel speech representation codec for semantic speech tokenization. In contrast to audio codecs which reconstruct the raw audio, RepCodec learns a vector quantization codebook through reconstructing speech representations from speech encoders like HuBERT or data2vec. Together, the speech encoder, the codec encoder and the vector quantization codebook form a pipeline for converting speech waveforms into semantic tokens. The extensive experiments illustrate that RepCodec, by virtue of its enhanced information retention capacity, significantly outperforms the widely used k-means clustering approach in both speech understanding and generation. Furthermore, this superiority extends across various speech encoders and languages, affirming the robustness of RepCodec.We believe our method can facilitate large language modeling research on speech processing.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.314	Zhichao Huang, Chutong Meng, Tom Ko
PRP-Graph: Pairwise Ranking Prompting to LLMs with Graph Aggregation for Effective Text Re-ranking	Pairwise Ranking Prompting (PRP) demonstrates impressive effectiveness in zero-shot document re-ranking tasks with large language models (LLMs). However, in the existing methods, PRP only outputs the same label for the comparison results of different confidence intervals without considering the uncertainty of pairwise comparison, which implies an underutilization of the generation probability information of LLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose PRP-Graph, a novel pairwise re-ranking approach, based on a refined scoring PRP unit that exploits the output probabilities of target labels to capture the degree of certainty of the comparison results. Specifically, the PRP-Graph consists of two stages, namely ranking graph construction and ranking graph aggregation. Extensive experiments conducted on the BEIR benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing PRP-based methods. Comprehensive analysis reveals that the PRP-Graph displays strong robustness towards the initial ranking order and delivers exceptional re-ranking results with acceptable efficiency. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Memelank/PRP-Graph.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.313	Jian Luo, Xuanang Chen, Ben He, Le Sun
Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Dialogue State Tracking via Dual Low-Rank Adaptation	Zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST) seeks to enable dialogue systems to transition to unfamiliar domains without manual annotation or extensive retraining. Prior research has approached this objective by embedding prompts into language models (LMs). Common methodologies include integrating prompts at the input layer or introducing learnable variables at each transformer layer. Nonetheless, each strategy exhibits inherent limitations. Prompts integrated at the input layer risk underutilization, with their impact potentially diminishing across successive transformer layers. Conversely, the addition of learnable variables to each layer can complicate the training process and increase inference latency. To tackle the issues mentioned above, this paper proposes Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), a plug-and-play architecture designed for zero-shot DST. DualLoRA incorporates two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) components, targeting both dialogue context processing and prompt optimization, to ensure the comprehensive influence of prompts throughout the transformer model layers. This is achieved without incurring additional inference latency, showcasing an efficient integration into existing architectures. Through rigorous evaluation on the MultiWOZ and SGD datasets, DualLoRA demonstrates notable improvements across multiple domains, outperforming traditional baseline methods in zero-shot settings.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.312	Xiang Luo, Zhiwen Tang, Jin Wang, Xuejie Zhang
A Deep Dive into the Trade-Offs of Parameter-Efficient Preference Alignment Techniques	Large language models are first pre-trained on trillions of tokens and then instruction-tuned or aligned to specific preferences. While pre-training remains out of reach for most researchers due to the compute required, fine-tuning has become affordable thanks to parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA and QLoRA. Alignment is known to be sensitive to the many factors involved, including the quantity and quality of data, the alignment method, and the adapter rank. However, there has not yet been an extensive study of their effect on downstream performance. To address this gap, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the impact of popular choices for three crucial axes: (i) the alignment dataset (HH-RLHF and BeaverTails), (ii) the alignment technique (SFT and DPO), and (iii) the model (LLaMA-1, Vicuna-v1.3, Mistral-7b, and Mistral-7b-Instruct). Our extensive setup spanning over 300 experiments reveals consistent trends and unexpected findings. We observe how more informative data helps with preference alignment, cases where supervised fine-tuning outperforms preference optimization, and how aligning to a distinct preference boosts performance on downstream tasks. Through our in-depth analyses, we put forward key guidelines to help researchers perform more effective parameter-efficient LLM alignment.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.311	Megh Thakkar, Quentin Fournier, Matthew Riemer, Pin-Yu Chen, Amal Zouaq, Payel Das, Sarath Chandar
Forgetting before Learning: Utilizing Parametric Arithmetic for Knowledge Updating in Large Language Models	Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their remarkable capabilities in text understanding and generation. However, even stronger LLMs are susceptible to acquiring erroneous or obsolete information from the training corpus. Direct secondary fine-tuning with data containing new knowledge may be ineffective in updating knowledge due to the conflict between old and new knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for fine-tuning called F-Learning (Forgetting before Learning), which employs parametric arithmetic to facilitate the forgetting of old knowledge and learning of new knowledge. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed F-Learning can obviously improve the knowledge updating performance of both full fine-tuning and LoRA fine-tuning, simultaneously outperforming the existing baselines in most cases. Moreover, we have also discovered that forgetting old knowledge by subtracting the parameters of LoRA can yield a similar effect to subtracting the parameters of full fine-tuning, and occasionally even surpass it significantly.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.310	Shiwen Ni, Dingwei Chen, Chengming Li, Xiping Hu, Ruifeng Xu, Min Yang
Language-Specific Neurons: The Key to Multilingual Capabilities in Large Language Models	"Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable multilingual capabilities without being pre-trained on specially curated multilingual parallel corpora.It remains a challenging problem to explain the underlying mechanisms by which LLMs process multilingual texts.In this paper, we delve into the composition of Transformer architectures in LLMs to pinpoint language-specific regions.Specially, we propose a novel detection method, language activation probability entropy (LAPE), to identify language-specific neurons within LLMs.Based on LAPE, we conduct comprehensive experiments on several representative LLMs, such as LLaMA-2, BLOOM, and Mistral. Our findings indicate that LLMs' proficiency in processing a particular language is predominantly due to a small subset of neurons, primarily situated in the models' top and bottom layers.Furthermore, we showcase the feasibility to ""steer"" the output language of LLMs by selectively activating or deactivating language-specific neurons. Our research provides important evidence to the understanding and exploration of the multilingual capabilities of LLMs."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.309	Tianyi Tang, Wenyang Luo, Haoyang Huang, Dongdong Zhang, Xiaolei Wang, Xin Zhao, Furu Wei, Ji-Rong Wen
Benchmarking Data Science Agents	In the era of data-driven decision-making, the complexity of data analysis necessitates advanced expertise and tools of data science, presenting significant challenges even for specialists. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising aids as data science agents, assisting humans in data analysis and processing. Yet their practical efficacy remains constrained by the varied demands of real-world applications and complicated analytical process. In this paper, we introduce DSEval – a novel evaluation paradigm, as well as a series of innovative benchmarks tailored for assessing the performance of these agents throughout the entire data science lifecycle. Incorporating a novel bootstrapped annotation method, we streamline dataset preparation, improve the evaluation coverage, and expand benchmarking comprehensiveness.

Speaker Verification in Agent-generated Conversations	The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has attracted widespread interest to develop role-playing conversational agents personalized to the characteristics and styles of different speakers to enhance their abilities to perform both general and special purpose dialogue tasks. However, the ability to personalize the generated utterances to speakers, whether conducted by human or LLM, has not been well studied. To bridge this gap, our study introduces a novel evaluation challenge: speaker verification in agent-generated conversations, which aimed to verify whether two sets of utterances originate from the same speaker. To this end, we assemble a large dataset collection encompassing thousands of speakers and their utterances. We also develop and evaluate speaker verification models under experiment setups. We further utilize the speaker verification models to evaluate the personalization abilities of LLM-based role-playing models. Comprehensive experiments suggest that the current role-playing models fail in accurately mimicking speakers, primarily due to their inherent linguistic characteristics.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.307	Yizhe Yang, Palakorn Achananuparp, Heyan Huang, Jing Jiang, Ee-Peng Lim
Learning Geometry-Aware Representations for New Intent Discovery	New intent discovery (NID) is an important problem for deploying practical dialogue systems, which trains intent classifiers on a semi-supervised corpus where unlabeled user utterances contain both known and novel intents. Most existing NID algorithms place hope on the sample similarity to cluster unlabeled corpus to known or new samples. Lacking supervision on new intents, we experimentally find the intent classifier fails to fully distinguish new intents since they tend to assemble into intertwined centers.To address this problem, we propose a novel GeoID framework that learns geometry-aware representations to maximally separate all intents. Specifically, we are motivated by the recent findings on Neural Collapse (NC) in classification tasks to derive optimal intent center structure. Meanwhile, we devise a dual pseudo-labeling strategy based on optimal transport assignments and semi-supervised clustering, ensuring proper utterances-to-center arrangement.Extensive results show that our GeoID method establishes a new state-of-the-art performance, achieving a +3.49% average accuracy improvement on three standardized benchmarking datasets. We also verify its usefulness in assisting large language models for improved in-context performance.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.306	Kai Tang, Junbo Zhao, Xiao Ding, Runze Wu, Lei Feng, Gang Chen, Haobo Wang
Experiential Co-Learning of Software-Developing Agents	Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have brought significant changes to various domains, especially through LLM-driven autonomous agents. A representative scenario is in software development, where LLM agents demonstrate efficient collaboration, task division, and assurance of software quality, markedly reducing the need for manual involvement. However, these agents frequently perform a variety of tasks independently, without benefiting from past experiences, which leads to repeated mistakes and inefficient attempts in multi-step task execution. To this end, we introduce Experiential Co-Learning, a novel LLM-agent learning framework in which instructor and assistant agents gather shortcut-oriented experiences from their historical trajectories and use these past experiences for future task execution. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the framework enables agents to tackle unseen software-developing tasks more effectively. We anticipate that our insights will guide LLM agents towards enhanced autonomy and contribute to their evolutionary growth in cooperative learning.

Multi-Task Inference: Can Large Language Models Follow Multiple Instructions at Once?	Large language models (LLMs) are typically prompted to follow a single instruction per inference call. In this work, we analyze whether LLMs also hold the capability to handle multiple instructions simultaneously, denoted as Multi-Task Inference. For this purpose, we introduce the MTI Bench (Multi-Task Inference Benchmark), a comprehensive evaluation benchmark encompassing 5,000 instances across 25 tasks. Each task in the MTI Bench involves 2 to 3 sub-tasks. As expected, we first demonstrate that Multi-Task Inference reduces the total inference time by × 1.46 times in average since it does not require multiple inference calls. Interestingly, contrary to the expectation that LLMs would perform better when tasks are divided, we find that state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama-2-Chat-70B and GPT-4, show up to 7.3% and 12.4% improved performance with Multi-Task Inference compared to Single-Task Inference on the MTI Bench. We release the MTI Bench dataset and our code at this [link](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MTI-Bench-6F01).	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.304	Guijin Son, SangWon Baek, Sangdae Nam, Ilgyun Jeong, Seungone Kim
SafeDecoding: Defending against Jailbreak Attacks via Safety-Aware Decoding	As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications such as code generation and chatbot assistance, extensive efforts have been made to align LLM behavior with human values, including safety. Jailbreak attacks, which aim to provoke unintended and unsafe behaviors from LLMs, remain a significant LLM safety threat. We analyze tokens, which are the smallest unit of text that can be processed by LLMs and make the following observations: (1) probabilities of tokens representing harmful responses are higher than those of harmless responses, and (2) responses containing safety disclaimers appear among the top tokens when token probabilities are sorted in descending order. In this paper, we leverage (1) and (2) to develop SafeDecoding, a safety-aware decoding strategy for LLMs, to defend against jailbreak attacks. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate SafeDecoding against six SOTA jailbreak attacks (GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR, DeepInception, SAP30, and template based attack) on five LLMs (Vicuna, Llama2, Guanaco, falcon, and Dolphin) using four benchmark datasets (AdvBench, HEx-PHI, MT-Bench, and Just-Eval). Our results show that SafeDecoding significantly reduces attack success rate and harmfulness of jailbreak attacks without compromising the helpfulness of responses to benign user queries while outperforming six defense methods (Perpelexity, Paraphrase, Retokenization, Self-Reminder, ICD, and Self-Examination).	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.303	Zhangchen Xu, Fengqing Jiang, Luyao Niu, Jinyuan Jia, Bill Yuchen Lin, Radha Poovendran
Digital Socrates: Evaluating LLMs through Explanation Critiques	While LLMs can provide reasoned explanations along with their answers, the nature and quality of those explanations are still poorly understood. In response, our goal is to define a detailed way of characterizing the explanation capabilities of modern models and to create a nuanced, interpretable explanation evaluation tool that can generate such characterizations automatically, without relying on expensive API calls or human annotations. Our approach is to (a) define the new task of explanation critiquing - identifying and categorizing any main flaw in an explanation and providing suggestions to address the flaw, (b) create a sizeable, human-verified dataset for this task, and (c) train an open-source, automatic critique model (called Digital Socrates) using this data. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we demonstrate how Digital Socrates is useful for revealing insights about student models by examining their reasoning chains, and how it can provide high-quality, nuanced, automatic evaluation of those model explanations for the first time. Digital Socrates thus fills an important gap in evaluation tools for understanding and improving the explanation behavior of models.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.302	Yuling Gu, Oyvind Tafjord, Peter Clark
CodeScope: An Execution-based Multilingual Multitask Multidimensional Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on Code Understanding and Generation	Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on assisting humans in programming and facilitating programming automation. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating the code understanding and generation capacities of LLMs suffer from severe limitations. First, most benchmarks are insufficient as they focus on a narrow range of popular programming languages and specific tasks, whereas real-world software development scenarios show a critical need to implement systems with multilingual and multitask programming environments to satisfy diverse requirements. Second, most benchmarks fail to consider the actual executability and the consistency of execution results of the generated code. To bridge these gaps between existing benchmarks and expectations from practical applications, we introduce **CodeScope**, an execution-based, multilingual, multitask, multidimensional evaluation benchmark for comprehensively measuring LLM capabilities on coding tasks. CodeScope covers **43 programming languages** and **eight coding tasks**. It evaluates the coding performance of LLMs from three dimensions (perspectives): **length**, **difficulty**, and **efficiency**. To facilitate execution-based evaluations of code generation, we develop **MultiCodeEngine**, an automated code execution engine that supports 14 programming languages. Finally, we systematically evaluate and analyze eight mainstream LLMs and demonstrate the superior breadth and challenges of CodeScope for evaluating LLMs on code understanding and generation tasks compared to other benchmarks. The CodeScope benchmark and code are publicly available at https://github.com/WeixiangYAN/CodeScope.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.301	Weixiang Yan, Haitian Liu, Yunkun Wang, Yunzhe Li, Qian Chen, Wen Wang, Tingyu Lin, Weishan Zhao, Li Zhu, Hari Sundaram, Shuiguang Deng
NICE: To Optimize In-Context Examples or Not?	Recent work shows that in-context learning and optimization of in-context examples (ICE) can significantly improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on a wide range of tasks, leading to an apparent consensus that ICE optimization is crucial for better performance. However, most of these studies assume a fixed or no instruction provided in the prompt. We challenge this consensus by investigating the necessity of optimizing ICE when task-specific instructions are provided and find that there are many tasks for which it yields diminishing returns. In particular, using a diverse set of tasks and a systematically created instruction set with gradually added details, we find that as the prompt instruction becomes more detailed, the returns on ICE optimization diminish. To characterize this behavior, we introduce a task-specific metric called Normalized Invariability to Choice of Examples (NICE) that quantifies the learnability of tasks from a given instruction, and provides a heuristic to help decide whether to optimize instructions or ICE for a new task. Given a task, the proposed metric can reliably predict the utility of optimizing ICE compared to using random ICE. Our code is available at [https://github.com/microsoft/nice-icl](https://github.com/microsoft/nice-icl).	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.300	Pragya Srivastava, Satvik Golechha, Amit Deshpande, Amit Sharma
Jailbreak Open-Sourced Large Language Models via Enforced Decoding	"Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented performance in Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks. However, many existing studies have shown that they could be misused to generate undesired content. In response, before releasing LLMs for public access, model developers usually align those language models through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). Consequently, those aligned large language models refuse to generate undesired content when facing potentially harmful/unethical requests. A natural question is ""could alignment really prevent those open-sourced large language models from being misused to generate undesired content?"". In this work, we provide a negative answer to this question. In particular, we show those open-sourced, aligned large language models could be easily misguided to generate undesired content without heavy computations or careful prompt designs. Our key idea is to directly manipulate the generation process of open-sourced LLMs to misguide it to generate undesired content including harmful or biased information and even private data. We evaluate our method on 4 open-sourced LLMs accessible publicly and our finding highlights the need for more advanced mitigation strategies for open-sourced LLMs."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.299	Hangfan Zhang, Zhimeng Guo, Huaisheng Zhu, Bochuan Cao, Lu Lin, Jinyuan Jia, Jinghui Chen, Dinghao Wu
Threads of Subtlety: Detecting Machine-Generated Texts Through Discourse Motifs	With the advent of large language models (LLM), the line between human-crafted and machine-generated texts has become increasingly blurred. This paper delves into the inquiry of identifying discernible and unique linguistic properties in texts that were written by humans, particularly uncovering the underlying discourse structures of texts beyond their surface structures. Introducing a novel methodology, we leverage hierarchical parse trees and recursive hypergraphs to unveil distinctive discourse patterns in texts produced by both LLMs and humans. Empirical findings demonstrate that, although both LLMs and humans generate distinct discourse patterns influenced by specific domains, human-written texts exhibit more structural variability, reflecting the nuanced nature of human writing in different domains. Notably, incorporating hierarchical discourse features enhances binary classifiers' overall performance in distinguishing between human-written and machine-generated texts, even on out-of-distribution and paraphrased samples. This underscores the significance of incorporating hierarchical discourse features in the analysis of text patterns. The code and dataset will be available at [TBA].	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.298	Zae Myung Kim, Kwang Lee, Preston Zhu, Vipul Raheja, Dongyeop Kang
What Do Language Models Hear? Probing for Auditory Representations in Language Models	This work explores whether language models encode meaningfully grounded representations of sounds of objects. We learn a linear probe that retrieves the correct text representation of an object given a snippet of audio related to that object, where the sound representation is given by a pretrained audio model. This probe is trained via a contrastive loss that pushes the language representations and sound representations of an object to be close to one another. After training, the probe is tested on its ability to generalize to objects that were not seen during training. Across different language models and audio models, we find that the probe generalization is above chance in many cases, indicating that despite being trained only on raw text, language models encode grounded knowledge of sounds for some objects.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.297	Jerry Ngo, Yoon Kim
Instruction-tuned Language Models are Better Knowledge Learners	In order for large language model (LLM)-based assistants to effectively adapt to evolving information needs, it must be possible to update their factual knowledge through continued training on new data. The standard recipe for doing so involves continued pre-training on new documents followed by instruction-tuning on question-answer (QA) pairs. However, we find that LLMs trained with this recipe struggle to answer questions, even though the perplexity of documents is minimized. We found that QA pairs are generally straightforward, while documents are more complex, weaving many factual statements together in an intricate manner. Therefore, we hypothesize that it is beneficial to expose LLMs to QA pairs before continued pre-training on documents so that the process of encoding knowledge from complex documents takes into account how this knowledge is accessed through questions. Based on this, we propose pre-instruction-tuning (PIT), a method that instruction-tunes on questions prior to training on documents. This contrasts with standard instruction-tuning, which learns how to extract knowledge after training on documents. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that pre-instruction-tuning significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to absorb knowledge from new documents, outperforming standard instruction-tuning by 17.8%.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.296	Zhengbao Jiang, Zhiqing Sun, Weijia Shi, Pedro Rodriguez, Chunting Zhou, Graham Neubig, Xi Lin, Wen-tau Yih, Srini Iyer
Generative Explore-Exploit: Training-free Optimization of Generative Recommender Systems using LLM Optimizers	Recommender systems are widely used to suggest engaging content, and Large Language Models (LLMs) have given rise to generative recommenders. Such systems can directly generate items, including for open-set tasks like question suggestion. While the world knowledge of LLMs enables good recommendations, improving the generated content through user feedback is challenging as continuously fine-tuning LLMs is prohibitively expensive. We present a training-free approach for optimizing generative recommenders by connecting user feedback loops to LLM-based optimizers. We propose a generative explore-exploit method that can not only exploit generated items with known high engagement, but also actively explore and discover hidden population preferences to improve recommendation quality. We evaluate our approach on question generation in two domains (e-commerce and general knowledge), and model user feedback with Click Through Rate (CTR). Experiments show our LLM-based explore-exploit approach can iteratively improve recommendations and consistently increase CTR. Ablation analysis shows that generative exploration is key to learning user preferences, avoiding the pitfalls of greedy exploit-only approaches. A human evaluation strongly supports our quantitative findings.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.295	Lütfi Kerem Senel, Besnik Fetahu, Davis Yoshida, Zhiyu Chen, Giuseppe Castellucci, Nikhita Vedula, Jason Ingyu Choi, Shervin Malmasi
Noise Correction on Subjective Datasets	Incorporating every annotator's perspective is crucial for unbiased data modeling. Annotator fatigue and changing opinions over time can distort dataset annotations. To combat this, we propose to learn a more accurate representation of diverse opinions by utilizing multitask learning in conjunction with loss-based label correction. We show that using our novel formulation, we can cleanly separate agreeing and disagreeing annotations. Furthermore, this method provides a controllable way to encourage or discourage disagreement. We demonstrate that this modification can improve prediction performance in a single or multi-annotator setting. Lastly, we show that this method remains robust to additional label noise that is applied to subjective data.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.294	Uthman Jinadu, Yi Ding
Your Transformer is Secretly Linear	This paper reveals a novel linear characteristic exclusive to transformer decoders, including models like GPT, LLaMA, OPT, BLOOM and others. We analyze embedding transformations between sequential layers, uncovering an almost perfect linear relationship (Procrustes similarity score of 0.99). However, linearity decreases when the residual component is removed, due to a consistently low transformer layer output norm. Our experiments show that pruning or linearly approximating some of the layers does not impact loss or model performance significantly. Moreover, we introduce a cosine-similarity-based regularization in our pretraining experiments on smaller models, aimed at reducing layer linearity. This regularization not only improves performance metrics on benchmarks like Tiny Stories and SuperGLUE but as well successfully decreases the linearity of the models. This study challenges the existing understanding of transformer architectures, suggesting that their operation may be more linear than previously assumed.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.293	Anton Razzhigaev, Matvey Mikhalchuk, Elizaveta Goncharova, Nikolai Gerasimenko, Ivan Oseledets, Denis Dimitrov, Andrey Kuznetsov
Agent-Pro: Learning to Evolve via Policy-Level Reflection and Optimization	"Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit robust problem-solving capabilities for diverse tasks. However, most LLM-based agents are designed as specific task solvers with sophisticated prompt engineering, rather than agents capable of learning and evolving through interactions. These task solvers necessitate manually crafted prompts to inform task rules and regulate LLM behaviors, inherently incapacitating to address complex dynamic scenarios e.g., large interactive games. In light of this, we propose Agent-Pro: an LLM-based Agent with Policy-level Reflection and Optimization that can learn a wealth of expertise from interactive experiences and progressively elevate its behavioral policy. Specifically, it involves a dynamic belief generation and reflection process for policy evolution. Rather than action-level reflection, Agent-Pro iteratively reflects on past trajectories and beliefs, ""fine-tuning"" its irrational beliefs for a better policy. Moreover, a depth-first search is employed for policy optimization, ensuring continual enhancement in policy payoffs. Agent-Pro is evaluated across two games: Blackjack and Texas Hold'em, outperforming vanilla LLM and specialized models. Our results show Agent-Pro can learn and evolve in complex and dynamic scenes, which also benefits numerous LLM-based applications."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.292	Wenqi Zhang, Ke Tang, Hai Wu, Mengna Wang, Yongliang Shen, Guiyang Hou, Zeqi Tan, Peng Li, Yueting Zhuang, Weiming Lu
Improving Hateful Meme Detection through Retrieval-Guided Contrastive Learning	Hateful memes have emerged as a significant concern on the Internet. Detecting hateful memes requires the system to jointly understand the visual and textual modalities. Our investigation reveals that the embedding space of existing CLIP-based systems lacks sensitivity to subtle differences in memes that are vital for correct hatefulness classification. We propose constructing a hatefulness-aware embedding space through retrieval-guided contrastive training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the HatefulMemes dataset with an AUROC of 87.0, outperforming much larger fine-tuned large multimodal models. We demonstrate a retrieval-based hateful memes detection system, which is capable of identifying hatefulness based on data unseen in training. This allows developers to update the hateful memes detection system by simply adding new examples without retraining — a desirable feature for real services in the constantly evolving landscape of hateful memes on the Internet.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.291	Jingbiao Mei, Jinghong Chen, Weizhe Lin, Bill Byrne, Marcus Tomalin
Triple-Encoders: Representations That Fire Together, Wire Together	Search-based dialog models typically re-encode the dialog history at every turn, incurring high cost.Curved Contrastive Learning, a representation learning method that encodes relative distances between utterances into the embedding space via a bi-encoder, has recently shown promising results for dialog modeling at far superior efficiency.While high efficiency is achieved through independently encoding utterances, this ignores the importance of contextualization. To overcome this issue, this study introduces triple-encoders, which efficiently compute distributed utterance mixtures from these independently encoded utterances through a novel hebbian inspired co-occurrence learning objective in a self-organizing manner, without using any weights, i.e., merely through local interactions. Empirically, we find that triple-encoders lead to a substantial improvement over bi-encoders, and even to better zero-shot generalization than single-vector representation models without requiring re-encoding. Our code (https://github.com/UKPLab/acl2024-triple-encoders) and model (https://huggingface.co/UKPLab/triple-encoders-dailydialog) are publicly available.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.290	Justus-Jonas Erker, Florian Mai, Nils Reimers, Gerasimos Spanakis, Iryna Gurevych
PreFLMR: Scaling Up Fine-Grained Late-Interaction Multi-modal Retrievers	Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in natural language and visual understanding but are challenged by exacting tasks such as Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) which involve the retrieval of relevant information from document collections to use in shaping answers to questions. We present an extensive training and evaluation framework, M2KR, for KB-VQA. M2KR contains a collection of vision and language tasks which we have incorporated into a single suite of benchmark tasks for training and evaluating general-purpose multi-modal retrievers. We use M2KR to develop PreFLMR, a pre-trained version of the recently developed Fine-grained Late-interaction Multi-modal Retriever (FLMR) approach to KB-VQA, and we report new state-of-the-art results across a range of tasks. We also present investigations into the scaling behaviors of PreFLMR intended to be useful in future developments in general-purpose multi-modal retrievers.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.289	Weizhe Lin, Jingbiao Mei, Jinghong Chen, Bill Byrne
UHGEval: Benchmarking the Hallucination of Chinese Large Language Models via Unconstrained Generation	Large language models (LLMs) produce hallucinated text, compromising their practical utility in professional contexts. To assess the reliability of LLMs, numerous initiatives have developed benchmark evaluations for hallucination phenomena. However, they often employ constrained generation techniques to produce the evaluation dataset due to cost and time limitations. For instance, this may involve employing directed hallucination induction or deliberately modifying authentic text to generate hallucinations. These are not congruent with the unrestricted text generation demanded by real-world applications. Furthermore, a well-established Chinese-language dataset dedicated to the evaluation of hallucinations is presently lacking. Consequently, we have developed an Unconstrained Hallucination Generation Evaluation (UHGEval) benchmark, containing hallucinations generated by LLMs with minimal restrictions. Concurrently, we have established a comprehensive benchmark evaluation framework to aid subsequent researchers in undertaking scalable and reproducible experiments. We have also evaluated prominent Chinese LLMs and the GPT series models to derive insights regarding hallucination.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.288	Xun Liang, Shichao Song, Simin Niu, Zhiyu Li, Feiyu Xiong, Bo Tang, Yezhaohui Wang, Dawei He, Cheng Peng, Zhonghao Wang, Haiying Deng
Rethinking the Multimodal Correlation of Multimodal Sequential Learning via Generalizable Attentional Results Alignment	Transformer-based methods have gone mainstream in multimodal sequential learning. The intra and inter modality interactions are captured by the query-key associations of multi-head attention. In this way, the calculated multimodal contexts (attentional results) are expected to be relevant to the query modality. However, in existing literature, the alignment degree between different calculated attentional results of the same query are under-explored. Based on this concern, we propose a new constrained scheme called Multimodal Contextual Contrast (MCC), which could align the multiple attentional results from both local and global perspectives, making the information capture more efficient. Concretely, the calculated attentional results of different modalities are mapped into a common feature space, those attentional vectors with the same query are considered as a positive group and the remaining sets are negative. From local perspective, we sample the negative groups for a positive group by randomly changing the sequential step of one specific context and keeping the other stay the same. From coarse global perspective, we divide all the contextual groups into two sets (i.e., aligned and unaligned), making the total score of aligned group relatively large. We extend the vectorial inner product operation for more input and calculate the aligned score for each multimodal group. Considering that the computational complexity scales exponentially to the number of modalities, we adopt stochastic expectation approximation (SEA) for the real process. The extensive experimental results on several tasks reveal the effectiveness of our contributions.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.287	Tao Jin, Wang Lin, Ye Wang, Linjun Li, Xize Cheng, Zhou Zhao
PCAD: Towards ASR-Robust Spoken Language Understanding via Prototype Calibration and Asymmetric Decoupling	Spoken language understanding (SLU) inevitably suffers from error propagation from automatic speech recognition (ASR) in actual scenarios. Some recent works attempt to alleviate this issue through contrastive learning. However, they (1) sample negative pairs incorrectly in pre-training; (2) only focus on implicit metric learning while neglecting explicit erroneous predictions; (3) treat manual and ASR transcripts indiscriminately. In this paper, we propose a novel framework termed PCAD , which can calibrate bias and errors and achieve adaptive-balanced decoupling training. Specifically, PCAD utilizes a prototype-based loss to aggregate label and prediction priors and calibrate bias and error-prone semantics for better inter-class discrimination and intra-class consistency. We theoretically analyze the effect of this loss on robustness enhancement. Further, we leverage a teacher-student model for asymmetric decoupling training between different transcripts and formulate a novel gradient-sensitive exponential moving averaging (GS-EMA) algorithm for adaptive balance of accuracy and robustness. Experiments on three datasets show that PCAD significantly outperforms existing approaches and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.286	Xianwei Zhuang, Xuxin Cheng, Liming Liang, Yuxin Xie, Zhichang Wang, Zhiqi Huang, Yuexian Zou
Beyond Scaling: Predicting Patent Approval with Domain-specific Fine-grained Claim Dependency Graph	Model scaling is becoming the default choice for many language tasks due to the success of large language models (LLMs). However, it can fall short in specific scenarios where simple customized methods excel. In this paper, we delve into the patent approval prediction task and unveil that simple domain-specific graph methods outperform enlarging the model, using the intrinsic dependencies within the patent data. Specifically, we first extend the embedding-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) by scaling up its backbone model with various sizes of open-source LLMs, then explore prompt-based methods to harness proprietary LLMs' potential, but find the best results close to random guessing, underlining the ineffectiveness of model scaling-up. Hence, we propose a novel Fine-grained cLAim depeNdency (FLAN) Graph through meticulous patent data analyses, capturing the inherent dependencies across segments of the patent text. As it is model-agnostic, we apply cost-effective graph models to our FLAN Graph to obtain representations for approval prediction. Extensive experiments and detailed analyses prove that incorporating FLAN Graph via various graph models consistently outperforms all LLM baselines significantly. We hope that our observations and analyses in this paper can bring more attention to this challenging task and prompt further research into the limitations of LLMs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.285	Xiaochen Gao, Feng Yao, Kewen Zhao, Beilei He, Animesh Kumar, Vish Krishnan, Jingbo Shang
Marathon: A Race Through the Realm of Long Context with Large Language Models	With the advancement of large language models (LLMs) and the expansion of their context windows, existing long-context benchmarks fall short in effectively evaluating the models' comprehension and reasoning abilities in extended texts. Moreover, conventional benchmarks relying on F1 metrics often inaccurately score responses: they may undervalue correct answers that differ from the reference responses and overvalue incorrect ones that resemble the reference texts. In response to these limitations, we introduce Marathon, a novel evaluation benchmark that adopts a multiple-choice question format. It is specifically designed to overcome the constraints of previous benchmarks and provide a rapid, precise, and unbiased appraisal of the long-context comprehension skills of large language models. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on the Marathon benchmark with a range of state-of-the-art LLMs and assessed the effectiveness of various optimization strategies tailored for long-context generation. We anticipate that the Marathon benchmark and its associated leaderboard will enable a more precise and equitable evaluation of LLMs' capabilities in understanding and reasoning over extended contexts.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.284	Lei Zhang, Yunshui Li, Ziqiang Liu, Jiaxi Yang, Junhao Liu, Longze Chen, Run Luo, Min Yang
Quantifying Uncertainty in Answers from any Language Model and Enhancing their Trustworthiness	We introduce BSDetector, a method for detecting bad and speculative answers from a pretrained Large Language Model by estimating a numeric confidence score for any output it generated. Our uncertainty quantification technique works for any LLM accessible only via a black-box API, whose training data remains unknown. By expending a bit of extra computation, users of any LLM API can now get the same response as they would ordinarily, as well as a confidence estimate that cautions when not to trust this response. Experiments on both closed and open-form Question-Answer benchmarks reveal that BSDetector more accurately identifies incorrect LLM responses than alternative uncertainty estimation procedures (for both GPT-3 and ChatGPT). By sampling multiple responses from the LLM and considering the one with the highest confidence score, we can additionally obtain more accurate responses from the same LLM, without extra training steps. In applications involving automated evaluation with LLMs, accounting for our confidence scores leads to more reliable evaluation in both human-in-the-loop and fully-automated settings (across both GPT 3.5 and 4).	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.283	Jiuhai Chen, Jonas Mueller
OLIVE: Object Level In-Context Visual Embeddings	Recent generalist vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities across diverse multimodal tasks. However, these models still struggle with fine-grained object-level understanding and grounding. In terms of modeling, existing VLMs implicitly align text tokens with image patch tokens, which is ineffective for embedding alignment at the same granularity and inevitably introduces noisy spurious background features. Additionally, these models struggle when generalizing to unseen visual concepts and may not be reliable for domain-specific tasks without further fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method to prompt large language models with in-context visual object vectors, thereby enabling controllable object-level reasoning. This eliminates the necessity of fusing a lengthy array of image patch features and significantly speeds up training. Furthermore, we propose region-level retrieval using our object representations, facilitating rapid adaptation to new objects without additional training. Our experiments reveal that our method achieves competitive referring object classification and captioning performance, while also offering zero-shot generalization and robustness to visually challenging contexts.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.282	Timothy Ossowski, Junjie Hu
Eliciting Better Multilingual Structured Reasoning from LLMs through Code	The development of large language models (LLM) has shown progress on reasoning, though studies have largely considered either English or simple reasoning tasks. To address this, we introduce a multilingual structured reasoning and explanation dataset, termed xSTREET, that covers four tasks across six languages. xSTREET exposes a gap in base LLM performance between English and non-English reasoning tasks.We then propose two methods to remedy this gap, building on the insight that LLMs trained on code are better reasoners. First, at training time, we augment a code dataset with multilingual comments using machine translation while keeping program code as-is. Second, at inference time, we bridge the gap between training and inference by employing a prompt structure that incorporates step-by-step code primitives to derive new facts and find a solution. Our methods show improved multilingual performance on xSTREET, most notably on the scientific commonsense reasoning subtask. Furthermore, the models show no regression on non-reasoning tasks, thus demonstrating our techniques maintain general-purpose abilities.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.281	Bryan Li, Tamer Alkhouli, Daniele Bonadiman, Nikolaos Pappas, Saab Mansour
WaveCoder: Widespread And Versatile Enhancement For Code Large Language Models By Instruction Tuning	Recent work demonstrates that, after instruction tuning, Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) can obtain impressive capabilities to address a wide range of code-related tasks. However, current instruction tuning methods for Code LLMs mainly focus on the traditional code generation task, resulting in poor performance in complex multi-task scenarios. In this paper, we concentrate on multiple code-related tasks and present WaveCoder, a series of Code LLMs trained with Widespread And Versatile Enhanced instruction data. To enable the models to tackle complex code-related tasks, we propose a method to stably generate diverse, high-quality instruction data from open source code dataset in multi-task scenarios and obtain CodeOcean, a dataset comprising 19,915 instruction instances across 4 code-related tasks, which is aimed at improving the generalization ability of Code LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that WaveCoder models significantly outperform other open-source models in terms of the generalization ability across different code-related tasks. Moreover, WaveCoder-Ultra-6.7B presents the state-of-the-art generalization abilities on a wide range of code-related tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.280	Zhaojian Yu, Xin Zhang, Ning Shang, Yangyu Huang, Can Xu, Yishujie Zhao, Wenxiang Hu, Qiufeng Yin
Are Emergent Abilities in Large Language Models just In-Context Learning?	"Large language models, comprising billions of parameters and pre-trained on extensive web-scale corpora, have been claimed to acquire certain capabilities without having been specifically trained on them. These capabilities, referred to as ""emergent abilities,"" have been a driving force in discussions regarding the potentials and risks of language models. A key challenge in evaluating emergent abilities is that they are confounded by model competencies that arise through alternative prompting techniques, including in-context learning, which is the ability of models to complete a task based on a few examples. We present a novel theory that explains emergent abilities, taking into account their potential confounding factors, and rigorously substantiate this theory through over 1000 experiments. Our findings suggest that purported emergent abilities are not truly emergent, but result from a combination of in-context learning, model memory, and linguistic knowledge. Our work is a foundational step in explaining language model performance, providing a template for their efficient use and clarifying the paradox of their ability to excel in some instances while faltering in others. Thus, we demonstrate that their capabilities should not be overestimated."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.279	Sheng Lu, Irina Bigoulaeva, Rachneet Sachdeva, Harish Tayyar Madabushi, Iryna Gurevych
Estimating Agreement by Chance for Sequence Annotation	In the field of natural language processing, correction of performance assessment for chance agreement plays a crucial role in evaluating the reliability of annotations. However, there is a notable dearth of research focusing on chance correction for assessing the reliability of sequence annotation tasks, despite their widespread prevalence in the field. To address this gap, this paper introduces a novel model for generating random annotations, which serves as the foundation for estimating chance agreement in sequence annotation tasks. Utilizing the proposed randomization model and a related comparison approach, we successfully derive the analytical form of the distribution, enabling the computation of the probable location of each annotated text segment and subsequent chance agreement estimation. Through a combination simulation and corpus-based evaluation, we successfully assess its applicability and validate its accuracy and efficacy.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.278	Diya Li, Carolyn Rose, Ao Yuan, Chunxiao Zhou
Babel-ImageNet: Massively Multilingual Evaluation of Vision-and-Language Representations	"Vision-and-language (VL) models with separate encoders for each modality (e.g., CLIP) have become the go-to models for zero-shot image classification and image-text retrieval. They are, however, mostly evaluated in English as multilingual benchmarks are limited in availability. We introduce Babel-ImageNet, a massively multilingual benchmark that offers (partial) translations of ImageNet labels to 100 languages, built without machine translation or manual annotation. We instead automatically obtain reliable translations by linking them – via shared WordNet synsets – to BabelNet, a massively multilingual lexico-semantic network. We evaluate 11 public multilingual CLIP models on zero-shot image classification (ZS-IC) on our benchmark, demonstrating a significant gap between English ImageNet performance and that of high-resource languages (e.g., German or Chinese), and an even bigger gap for low-resource languages (e.g., Sinhala or Lao). Crucially, we show that the models' ZS-IC performance highly correlates with their performance in image-text retrieval, validating the use of Babel-imageNet to evaluate multilingual models for the vast majority of languages without gold image-text data. Finally, we show that the performance of multilingual CLIP can be drastically improved for low-resource languages with parameter-efficient language-specific training.

Shifting Attention to Relevance: Towards the Predictive Uncertainty Quantification of Free-Form Large Language Models	"Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising results in language generation and instruction following but frequently ""hallucinate"", making their outputs less reliable. Despite Uncertainty Quantification's (UQ) potential solutions, implementing it accurately within LLMs is challenging. Our research introduces a simple heuristic: not all tokens in auto-regressive LLM text equally represent the underlying meaning, as ""linguistic redundancy"" often allows a few keywords to convey the essence of long sentences. However, current methods underestimate this inequality when assessing uncertainty, causing tokens with limited semantics to be equally or excessively weighted in UQ. To correct this, we propose Shifting Attention to more Relevant (SAR) components at both token- and sentence-levels for better UQ. We conduct extensive experiments involving a range of popular ""off-the-shelf"" LLMs, such as Vicuna, WizardLM, and LLaMA-2-chat, with model sizes extending up to 33B parameters. We evaluate various free-form question-answering tasks, encompassing domains such as reading comprehension, science Q&A, and medical Q&A. Our experimental results, coupled with a comprehensive demographic analysis, demonstrate the superior performance of SAR.

PITA: Prompting Task Interaction for Argumentation Mining	Argumentation mining (AM) aims to detect the arguments and their inherent relations from argumentative textual compositions. Generally, AM comprises three key challenging subtasks, including argument component type classification (ACTC), argumentative relation identification (ARI), and argumentative relation type classification (ARTC). Prior methods are afflicted by a sequential feature decoding paradigm, wherein they initially address the features of argumentation components (ACs) for the task of ACTC. Then, these features are amalgamated in pairs to tackle the task of ARI. Finally, the AC pairs and ascertained pertinent relations are employed for ARTC. However, the explicit and comprehensive inter-relationship among the three subtasks is neglected. In this paper, we propose a novel method PITA for PromptIng Task interAction to model the inter-relationships among the three subtasks within a generative framework. Specifically, we employ a dynamic prompt template to indicate all ACs and AC pairs in the three subtasks. Then, from a multi-relational perspective, we construct an undirected heterogeneous graph to capture the various relationships within and between ACs and AC pairs. We apply the Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) on the graph and inject the task interaction information into the soft prompts with continuous representations. PITA jointly decodes all ACs and AC pairs using the prompt template with task interaction information, which thus explicitly and comprehensively harmonizes the information propagation across the three subtasks. Extensive experiments show PITA achieves state-of-the-art performances on two AM benchmarks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.275	Yang Sun, Muyi Wang, Jianzhu Bao, Bin Liang, Xiaoyan Zhao, Caihua Yang, Min Yang, Ruifeng Xu
QueryAgent: A Reliable and Efficient Reasoning Framework with Environmental Feedback based Self-Correction	Employing Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic parsing has achieved remarkable success. However, we find existing methods fall short in terms of reliability and efficiency when hallucinations are encountered. In this paper, we address these challenges with a framework called QueryAgent, which solves a question step-by-step and performs stepwise self-correction. We introduce an environmental feedback-based self-correction method called ERASER. Unlike traditional approaches, ERASER leverages rich environmental feedback in the intermediate steps to perform selective and differentiated self-correction only when necessary. Experimental results demonstrate that QueryAgent notably outperforms all previous few-shot methods using only one example on GrailQA and GraphQ by 5.7 and 15.0 points. Furthermore, our approach exhibits superiority in terms of efficiency, including run-time, query overhead, and API invocation costs. By leveraging ERASER, we further improve another baseline (i.e., AgentBench) by approximately 10 points, validating the strong transferability of our approach.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.274	Xiang Huang, Sitao Cheng, Shanshan Huang, Jiayu Shen, Yong Xu, Chaoyun Zhang, Yuzhong Qu
LLM Knows Body Language, Too: Translating Speech Voices into Human Gestures	In response to the escalating demand for digital human representations, progress has been made in the generation of realistic human gestures from given speeches. Despite the remarkable achievements of recent research, the generation process frequently includes unintended, meaningless, or non-realistic gestures. To address this challenge, we propose a gesture translation paradigm, GesTran, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to deepen the understanding of the connection between speech and gesture and sequentially generates human gestures by interpreting gestures as a unique form of body language. The primary stage of the proposed framework employs a transformer-based auto-encoder network to encode human gestures into discrete symbols. Following this, the subsequent stage utilizes a pre-trained LLM to decipher the relationship between speech and gesture, translating the speech into gesture by interpreting the gesture as unique language tokens within the LLM. Our method has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance improvement through extensive and impartial experiments conducted on public TED and TED-Expressive datasets.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.273	Chenghao Xu, Guangtao Lyu, Jiexi Yan, Muli Yang, Cheng Deng
Open Grounded Planning: Challenges and Benchmark Construction	The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has increasingly drawn attention to the use of LLMs for human-like planning. Existing work on LLM-based planning either focuses on leveraging the inherent language generation capabilities of LLMs to produce free-style plans, or employs reinforcement learning approaches to learn decision-making for a limited set of actions within restricted environments. However, both approaches exhibit significant discrepancies from the open and executable requirements in real-world planning. In this paper, we propose a new planning task–open grounded planning. The primary objective of open grounded planning is to ask the model to generate an executable plan based on a variable action set, thereby ensuring the executability of the produced plan. To this end, we establishes a benchmark for open grounded planning spanning a wide range of domains. Then we test current state-of-the-art LLMs along with five planning approaches, revealing that existing LLMs and methods still struggle to address the challenges posed by grounded planning in open domains. The outcomes of this paper define and establish a foundational dataset for open grounded planning, and shed light on the potential challenges and future directions of LLM-based planning.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.272	Shiguang Guo, Ziliang Deng, Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Le Sun
Boosting Language Models Reasoning with Chain-of-Knowledge Prompting	"Recently, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has delivered success on complex reasoning tasks, which aims at designing a simple prompt like ""Let's think step by step"" or multiple in-context exemplars with well-designed rationales to elicit Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate intermediate reasoning steps. However, the generated rationales often come with hallucinations, making unfactual and unfaithful reasoning chains. To mitigate this brittleness, we propose a novel Chain-of-Knowledge (CoK) prompting, where we aim at eliciting LLMs to generate explicit pieces of knowledge evidence in the form of structure triple. This is inspired by our human behaviors, i.e., we can draw a mind map or knowledge map as the reasoning evidence in the brain before answering a complex question. Benefiting from CoK, we additionally introduce an F2-Verification method to estimate the reliability of the reasoning chains in terms of factuality and faithfulness. For the unreliable response, the wrong evidence can be indicated to prompt the LLM to rethink. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can further improve the performance of commonsense, factual, symbolic, and arithmetic reasoning tasks."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.271	Jianing Wang, Qiushi Sun, Xiang Li, Ming Gao
MapCoder: Multi-Agent Code Generation for Competitive Problem Solving	Code synthesis, which requires a deep understanding of complex natural language (NL) problem descriptions, generation of code instructions for complex algorithms and data structures, and the successful execution of comprehensive unit tests, presents a significant challenge. Thus, while large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive proficiency in natural language processing (NLP), their performance in code generation tasks remains limited. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to code generation tasks leveraging the multi-agent prompting that uniquely replicates the full cycle of program synthesis as observed in human developers. Our framework, MapCoder, consists of four LLM agents specifically designed to emulate the stages of this cycle: recalling relevant examples, planning, code generation, and debugging. After conducting thorough experiments, with multiple LLMs ablations and analyses across eight challenging competitive problem-solving and program synthesis benchmarks—MapCoder showcases remarkable code generation capabilities, achieving their new state-of-the-art (pass@1) results—(HumanEval 93.9%, MBPP 83.1%, APPS 22.0%, CodeContests 28.5%, and xCodeEval 45.3%). Moreover, our method consistently delivers superior performance across various programming languages and varying problem difficulties. We open-source our framework at https://github.com/Md-Ashraful-Pramanik/MapCoder.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.269	Md. Ashraful Islam, Mohammed Eunus Ali, Md Rizwan Parvez
RelayAttention for Efficient Large Language Model Serving with Long System Prompts	A practical large language model (LLM) service may involve a long system prompt, which specifies the instructions, examples, and knowledge documents of the task and is reused across requests. However, the long system prompt causes throughput/latency bottlenecks as the cost of generating the next token grows w.r.t the sequence length. This paper aims to improve the efficiency of LLM services that involve long system prompts. Our key observation is that handling these system prompts requires heavily redundant memory accesses in existing causal attention computation algorithms. Specifically, for batched requests, the cached hidden states (i.e., key-value pairs) of system prompts are transferred from off-chip DRAM to on-chip SRAM multiple times, each corresponding to an individual request. To eliminate such a redundancy, we propose RelayAttention, an attention algorithm that allows reading these hidden states from DRAM exactly once for a batch of input tokens. RelayAttention is a free lunch: it maintains the generation quality while requiring no model retraining, as it is based on a mathematical reformulation of causal attention. We have observed significant performance improvements to a production-level system, vLLM, through integration with RelayAttention. The improvements are even more profound with longer system prompts.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.270	Lei Zhu, Xinjiang Wang, Wayne Zhang, Rynson Lau
Who Wrote this Code? Watermarking for Code Generation	Since the remarkable generation performance of large language models raised ethical and legal concerns, approaches to detect machine-generated text by embedding watermarks are being developed.However, we discover that the existing works fail to function appropriately in code generation tasks due to the task's nature of having low entropy.Extending a logit-modifying watermark method, we propose Selective WatErmarking via Entropy Thresholding (SWEET), which enhances detection ability and mitigates code quality degeneration by removing low-entropy segments at generating and detecting watermarks.Our experiments show that SWEET significantly improves code quality preservation while outperforming all baselines, including post-hoc detection methods, in detecting machine-generated code text.Our code is available inhttps://github.com/hongcheki/sweet-watermark.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.268	Taehyun Lee, Seokhee Hong, Jaewoo Ahn, Ilgee Hong, Hwaran Lee, Sangdoo Yun, Jamin Shin, Gunhee Kim
Temporal Knowledge Question Answering via Abstract Reasoning Induction	In this study, we address the challenge of enhancing temporal knowledge reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs often struggle with this task, leading to the generation of inaccurate or misleading responses. This issue mainly arises from their limited ability to handle evolving factual knowledge and complex temporal logic. To overcome these limitations, we propose Abstract Reasoning Induction (ARI) framework, which divides temporal reasoning into two distinct phases: Knowledge agnostic and Knowledge-based. This framework offers factual knowledge support to LLMs while minimizing the incorporation of extraneous noisy data. Concurrently, informed by the principles of constructivism, ARI provides LLMs the capability to engage in proactive, self-directed learning from both correct and incorrect historical reasoning samples. By teaching LLMs to actively construct knowledge and methods, it can significantly boosting their temporal reasoning abilities. Our approach achieves significant improvements, with relative gains of 29.7% and 9.27% on two temporal QA datasets, underscoring its efficacy in advancing temporal reasoning in LLMs. The code can be found at https: //github.com/czy1999/ARI-QA.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.267	Ziyang Chen, Dongfang Li, Xiang Zhao, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang
Limits of Theory of Mind Modelling in Dialogue-Based Collaborative Plan Acquisition	Recent work on dialogue-based collaborative plan acquisition (CPA) has suggested that Theory of Mind (ToM) modelling can improve missing knowledge prediction in settings with asymmetric skill-sets and knowledge. Although ToM was claimed to be important for effective collaboration, its real impact on this novel task remains under-explored. By representing plans as graphs and by exploiting task-specific constraints we show that, as performance on CPA nearly doubles when predicting one's own missing knowledge, the improvements due to ToM modelling diminish. This phenomenon persists even when evaluating existing baseline methods. To better understand the relevance of ToM for CPA, we report a principled performance comparison of models with and without ToM features. Results across different models and ablations consistently suggest that learned ToM features are indeed more likely to reflect latent patterns in the data with no perceivable link to ToM. This finding calls for a deeper understanding of the role of ToM in CPA and beyond, as well as new methods for modelling and evaluating mental states in computational collaborative agents.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.266	Matteo Bortoletto, Constantin Ruhdorfer, Adnen Abdessaied, Lei Shi, Andreas Bulling
Systematic Task Exploration with LLMs: A Study in Citation Text Generation	Large language models (LLMs) bring unprecedented flexibility in defining and executing complex, creative natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Yet, this flexibility brings new challenges, as it introduces new degrees of freedom in formulating the task inputs and instructions and in evaluating model performance. To facilitate the exploration of creative NLG tasks, we propose a three-component research framework that consists of systematic input manipulation, reference data, and output measurement. We use this framework to explore citation text generation – a popular scholarly NLP task that lacks consensus on the task definition and evaluation metric and has not yet been tackled within the LLM paradigm. Our results highlight the importance of systematically investigating both task instruction and input configuration when prompting LLMs, and reveal non-trivial relationships between different evaluation metrics used for citation text generation. Additional human generation and human evaluation experiments provide new qualitative insights into the task to guide future research in citation text generation. We make our code and data publicly available.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.265	Furkan Şahinuç, Ilia Kuznetsov, Yufang Hou, Iryna Gurevych
DiffuCOMET: Contextual Commonsense Knowledge Diffusion	Inferring contextually-relevant and diverse commonsense to understand narratives remains challenging for knowledge models. In this work, we develop a series of knowledge models, DiffuCOMET, that leverage diffusion to learn to reconstruct the implicit semantic connections between narrative contexts and relevant commonsense knowledge. Across multiple diffusion steps, our method progressively refines a representation of commonsense facts that is anchored to a narrative, producing contextually-relevant and diverse commonsense inferences for an input context. To evaluate DiffuCOMET, we introduce new metrics for commonsense inference that more closely measure knowledge diversity and contextual relevance. Our results on two different benchmarks, ComFact and WebNLG+, show that knowledge generated by DiffuCOMET achieves a better trade-off between commonsense diversity, contextual relevance and alignment to known gold references, compared to baseline knowledge models.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.264	Silin Gao, Mete Ismayilzada, Mengjie Zhao, Hiromi Wakaki, Yuki Mitsufuji, Antoine Bosselut
Spectral Filters, Dark Signals, and Attention Sinks	Projecting intermediate representations onto the vocabulary is an increasingly popular interpretation tool for transformer-based LLMs, also known as the logit lens (Nostalgebraist). We propose a quantitative extension to this approach and define spectral filters on intermediate representations based on partitioning the singular vectors of the vocabulary embedding and unembedding matrices into bands. We find that the signals exchanged in the tail end of the spectrum, i.e. corresponding to the singular vectors with smallest singular values, are responsible for attention sinking (Xiao et al., 2023), of which we provide an explanation. We find that the negative log-likelihood of pretrained models can be kept low despite suppressing sizeable parts of the embedding spectrum in a layer-dependent way, as long as attention sinking is preserved. Finally, we discover that the representation of tokens that draw attention from many tokens have large projections on the tail end of the spectrum, and likely act as additional attention sinks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.263	Nicola Cancedda
Planning Like Human: A Dual-process Framework for Dialogue Planning	In proactive dialogue, the challenge lies not just in generating responses but in steering conversations toward predetermined goals, a task where Large Language Models (LLMs) typically struggle due to their reactive nature. Traditional approaches to enhance dialogue planning in LLMs, ranging from elaborate prompt engineering to the integration of policy networks, either face efficiency issues or deliver suboptimal performance. Inspired by the dual-process theory in psychology, which identifies two distinct modes of thinking—intuitive (fast) and analytical (slow), we propose the Dual-Process Dialogue Planning (DPDP) framework. DPDP embodies this theory through two complementary planning systems: an instinctive policy model for familiar contexts and a deliberative Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) mechanism for complex, novel scenarios. This dual strategy is further coupled with a novel two-stage training regimen: offline Reinforcement Learning for robust initial policy model formation followed by MCTS-enhanced on-the-fly learning, which ensures a dynamic balance between efficiency and strategic depth. Our empirical evaluations across diverse dialogue tasks affirm DPDP's superiority in achieving both high-quality dialogues and operational efficiency, outpacing existing methods.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.262	Tao He, Lizi Liao, Yixin Cao, Yuanxing Liu, Ming Liu, Zerui Chen, Bing Qin
SpaRC and SpaRP: Spatial Reasoning Characterization and Path Generation for Understanding Spatial Reasoning Capability of Large Language Models	Spatial reasoning is a crucial component of both biological and artificial intelligence. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the capability of current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on spatial reasoning. To support our study, we created and contribute a novel Spatial Reasoning Characterization (SpaRC) framework and Spatial Reasoning Paths (SpaRP) datasets, to enable an in-depth understanding of the spatial relations and compositions as well as the usefulness of spatial reasoning chains. We found that all the state-of-the-art LLMs do not perform well on the datasets—their performances are consistently low across different setups. The spatial reasoning capability improves substantially as model sizes scale up. Finetuning both large language models (e.g., Llama-2-70B) and smaller ones (e.g., Llama-2-13B) can significantly improve their F1-scores by 7–32 absolute points. We also found that the top proprietary LLMs still significantly outperform their open-source counterparts in topological spatial understanding and reasoning.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.261	Md Imbesat Rizvi, Xiaodan Zhu, Iryna Gurevych
When Only Time Will Tell: Interpreting How Transformers Process Local Ambiguities Through the Lens of Restart-Incrementality	Incremental models that process sentences one token at a time will sometimes encounter points where more than one interpretation is possible. Causal models are forced to output one interpretation and continue, whereas models that can revise may edit their previous output as the ambiguity is resolved. In this work, we look at how restart-incremental Transformers build and update internal states, in an effort to shed light on what processes cause revisions not viable in autoregressive models. We propose an interpretable way to analyse the incremental states, showing that their sequential structure encodes information on the garden path effect and its resolution. Our method brings insights on various bidirectional encoders for contextualised meaning representation and dependency parsing, contributing to show their advantage over causal models when it comes to revisions.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.260	Brielen Madureira, Patrick Kahardipraja, David Schlangen
DolphCoder: Echo-Locating Code Large Language Models with Diverse and Multi-Objective Instruction Tuning	Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in code-related tasks. Various instruction finetuning approaches have been proposed to boost the code generation performance of pre-trained Code LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a diverse instruction model DolphCoder with self-evaluating for code generation. It learns diverse instruction targets and combines a code evaluation objective to enhance its code generation ability. Our model achieves superior performance on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, demonstrating new insights for future code instruction tuning work. Our key findings are: (1) Augmenting more diverse responses with more distinct reasoning paths increases the code capability of LLMs. (2) Improving one's ability to evaluate the correctness of code also enhances their ability to create it.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.259	Yejie Wang, Keqing He, Guanting Dong, Pei Wang, Weihao Zeng, Muxi Diao, Weiran Xu, Jingang Wang, Mengdi Zhang, Xunliang Cai
Learning to Edit: Aligning LLMs with Knowledge Editing	"Knowledge editing techniques, aiming to efficiently modify a minor proportion of knowledge in large language models (LLMs) without negatively impacting performance across other inputs, have garnered widespread attention. However, existing methods predominantly rely on memorizing the updated knowledge, impeding LLMs from effectively combining the new knowledge with their inherent knowledge when answering questions. To this end, we propose a Learning to Edit (LTE) framework, focusing on teaching LLMs to apply updated knowledge into input questions, inspired by the philosophy of ""Teach a man to fish."" LTE features a two-phase process: (i) the Alignment Phase, which fine-tunes LLMs on a meticulously curated parallel dataset to make reliable, in-scope edits while preserving out-of-scope information and linguistic proficiency; and (ii) the Inference Phase, which employs a retrieval-based mechanism for real-time and mass knowledge editing. By comparing our approach with seven advanced baselines across four popular knowledge editing benchmarks and two LLM architectures, we demonstrate LTE's superiority in knowledge editing performance, robustness in both batch and sequential editing, minimal interference on general tasks, and rapid editing speeds. The data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/YJiangcm/LTE."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.258	Yuxin Jiang, Yufei Wang, Chuhan Wu, Wanjun Zhong, Xingshan Zeng, Jiahui Gao, Liangyou Li, Xin Jiang, Lifeng Shang, Ruiming Tang, Qun Liu, Wei Wang
FollowBench: A Multi-level Fine-grained Constraints Following Benchmark for Large Language Models	The ability to follow instructions is crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle various real-world applications. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating pure response quality, rather than assessing whether the response follows constraints stated in the instruction. To fill this research gap, in this paper, we propose FollowBench, a Multi-level Fine-grained Constraints Following Benchmark for LLMs. FollowBench comprehensively includes five different types (i.e., Content, Situation, Style, Format, and Example) of fine-grained constraints. To enable a precise constraint following estimation on diverse difficulties, we introduce a Multi-level mechanism that incrementally adds a single constraint to the initial instruction at each increased level. To assess whether LLMs' outputs have satisfied every individual constraint, we propose to prompt strong LLMs with constraint-evolution paths to handle challenging open-ended instructions. By evaluating 13 closed-source and open-source popular LLMs on FollowBench, we highlight the weaknesses of LLMs in instruction following and point towards potential avenues for future work. The data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/YJiangcm/FollowBench.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.257	Yuxin Jiang, Yufei Wang, Xingshan Zeng, Wanjun Zhong, Liangyou Li, Fei Mi, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Wei Wang
NextLevelBERT: Masked Language Modeling with Higher-Level Representations for Long Documents	While (large) language models have significantly improved over the last years, they still struggle to sensibly process long sequences found, e.g., in books, due to the quadratic scaling of the underlying attention mechanism. To address this, we propose NextLevelBERT, a Masked Language Model operating not on tokens, but on higher-level semantic representations in the form of text embeddings. We pretrain NextLevelBERT to predict the vector representation of entire masked text chunks and evaluate the effectiveness of the resulting document vectors on three types of tasks: 1) Semantic Textual Similarity via zero-shot document embeddings, 2) Long document classification, 3) Multiple-choice question answering. We find that next-level Masked Language Modeling is an effective technique to tackle long-document use cases and can outperform much larger embedding models as long as the required level of detail of semantic information is not too fine. Our models and code are publicly available online.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.256	Tamara Czinczoll, Christoph Hönes, Maximilian Schall, Gerard De Melo
Re3: A Holistic Framework and Dataset for Modeling Collaborative Document Revision	Collaborative review and revision of textual documents is the core of knowledge work and a promising target for empirical analysis and NLP assistance. Yet, a holistic framework that would allow modeling complex relationships between document revisions, reviews and author responses is lacking. To address this gap, we introduce Re3, a framework for joint analysis of collaborative document revision. We instantiate this framework in the scholarly domain, and present Re3-Sci, a large corpus of aligned scientific paper revisions manually labeled according to their action and intent, and supplemented with the respective peer reviews and human-written edit summaries. We use the new data to provide first empirical insights into collaborative document revision in the academic domain, and to assess the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs at automating edit analysis and facilitating text-based collaboration. We make our annotation environment and protocols, the resulting data and experimental code publicly available.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.255	Qian Ruan, Ilia Kuznetsov, Iryna Gurevych
A Chain-of-Thought Is as Strong as Its Weakest Link: A Benchmark for Verifiers of Reasoning Chains	"Prompting language models to provide step-by-step answers (e.g., ""Chain-of-Thought"") is the prominent approach for complex reasoning tasks, where more accurate reasoning chains typically improve downstream task performance. Recent literature discusses automatic methods to verify reasoning to evaluate and improve their correctness. However, no fine-grained step-level datasets are available to enable thorough evaluation of such verification methods, hindering progress in this direction. We introduce REVEAL: Reasoning Verification Evaluation, a dataset to benchmark automatic verifiers of complex Chain-of-Thought reasoning in open-domain question-answering settings. REVEAL includes comprehensive labels for the relevance, attribution to evidence passages, and logical correctness of each reasoning step in a language model's answer, across a variety of datasets and state-of-the-art language models. Evaluation on REVEAL shows that verifiers struggle at verifying reasoning chains - in particular, verifying logical correctness and detecting contradictions.

Navigating the OverKill in Large Language Models	Large language models are meticulously aligned to be both helpful and harmless. However, recent research points to a potential overkill which means models may refuse to answer benign queries. In this paper, we investigate the factors for overkill by exploring how models handle and determine the safety of queries. Our findings reveal the presence of shortcuts within models, leading to excessive attention to harmful words like 'kill' and prompts emphasizing safety will exacerbate overkill. Based on these insights, we introduce Self-Contrastive Decoding (Self-CD), a training-free and model-agnostic strategy, to alleviate this phenomenon. We first extract such excessive attention by amplifying the difference in the model's output distributions when responding to system prompts that either include or omit an emphasis on safety. Then we determine the final next-token predictions by downplaying the excessive attention via contrastive decoding. Empirical results have indicated that our method has achieved an average reduction of the refusal rate by 20 % while having almost no impact on safety.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.253	Chenyu Shi, Xiao Wang, Qiming Ge, Songyang Gao, Xianjun Yang, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang, Xun Zhao, Dahua Lin
One-Shot Learning as Instruction Data Prospector for Large Language Models	Contemporary practices in instruction tuning often hinge on enlarging data scaling without a clear strategy for ensuring data quality, inadvertently introducing noise that may compromise model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Nuggets, a novel and efficient methodology that leverages one-shot learning to discern and select high-quality instruction data from extensive datasets. Nuggets assesses the potential of individual instruction examples to act as effective one-shot learning instances, thereby identifying those that can significantly improve performance across diverse tasks. Nuggets utilizes a scoring system based on the impact of candidate examples on the perplexity of a diverse anchor set, facilitating the selection of the most advantageous data for instruction tuning. Through rigorous evaluations on two benchmarks, namely MT-Bench and Alpaca-Eval, our study illustrates that instruction tuning with the top 1% of examples curated by Nuggets substantially outperforms conventional methods employing the entire dataset.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.252	Yunshui Li, Binyuan Hui, Xiaobo Xia, Jiaxi Yang, Min Yang, Lei Zhang, Shuzheng Si, Ling-Hao Chen, Junhao Liu, Tongliang Liu, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li
StepCoder: Improving Code Generation with Reinforcement Learning from Compiler Feedback	The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the field of code generation. Previous work integrated reinforcement learning (RL) with compiler feedback for exploring the output space of LLMs to enhance code generation quality. However, the lengthy code generated by LLMs in response to complex human requirements makes RL exploration a challenge. Also, since the unit tests may not cover the complicated code, optimizing LLMs by using these unexecuted code snippets is ineffective. To tackle these challenges, we introduce StepCoder, a novel RL framework for code generation, consisting of two main components: CCCS addresses the exploration challenge by breaking the long sequences code generation task into a Curriculum of Code Completion Subtasks, while FGO only optimizes the model by masking the unexecuted code segments to provide Fine-Grained Optimization. In addition, we furthermore construct the APPS+ dataset for RL training, which is manually verified to ensure the correctness of unit tests. Experimental results show that our method improves the ability to explore the output space and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in corresponding benchmarks. The code and dataset will be made available upon publication.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.251	Shihan Dou, Yan Liu, Haoxiang Jia, Enyu Zhou, Limao Xiong, Junjie Shan, Caishuang Huang, Xiao Wang, Xiaoran Fan, Zhiheng Xi, Yuhao Zhou, Tao Ji, Rui Zheng, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui, Xuanjing Huang
Factual Confidence of LLMs: on Reliability and Robustness of Current Estimators	Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to be unreliable on fact-based answers.To address this problem, NLP researchers have proposed a range of techniques to estimate LLM's confidence over facts. However, due to the lack of a systematic comparison, it is not clear how the different methods compare to one other.To fill this gap, we present a rigorous survey and empirical comparison of estimators of factual confidence.We define an experimental framework allowing for fair comparison, covering both fact-verification and QA. Our experiments across a series of LLMs indicate that trained hidden-state probes provide the most reliable confidence estimates; albeit at the expense of requiring access to weights and supervision data. We also conduct a deeper assessment of the methods, in which we measure the consistency of model behavior under meaning-preserving variations in the input. We find that the factual confidence of LLMs is often unstable across semantically equivalent inputs, suggesting there is much room for improvement for the stability of models' parametric knowledge.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.250	Matéo Mahaut, Laura Aina, Paula Czarnowska, Momchil Hardalov, Thomas Müller, Lluis Marquez
Using Synchronic Definitions and Semantic Relations to Classify Semantic Change Types	There is abundant evidence of the fact that the way words change their meaning can be classified in different types of change, highlighting the relationship between the old and new meanings (among which generalisation, specialisation and co-hyponymy transfer).In this paper, we present a way of detecting these types of change by constructing a model that leverages information both from synchronic lexical relations and definitions of word meanings. Specifically, we use synset definitions and hierarchy information from WordNet and test it on a digitized version of Blank's (1997) dataset of semantic change types. Finally, we show how the sense relationships can improve models for both approximation of human judgments of semantic relatedness as well as binary Lexical Semantic Change Detection.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.249	Pierluigi Cassotti, Stefano De Pascale, Nina Tahmasebi
Interpretability of Language Models via Task Spaces	The usual way to interpret language models (LMs) is to test their performance on different benchmarks and subsequently infer their internal processes.In this paper, we present an alternative approach, concentrating on the _quality_ of LM processing, with a focus on their language abilities.To this end, we construct 'linguistic task spaces' – representations of an LM's language conceptualisation – that shed light on the connections LMs draw between language phenomena.Task spaces are based on the interactions of the learning signals from different linguistic phenomena, which we assess via a method we call 'similarity probing'.To disentangle the learning signals of linguistic phenomena, we further introduce a method called 'fine-tuning via gradient differentials' (FTGD).We apply our methods to language models of three different scales and find that larger models generalise better to overarching general concepts for linguistic tasks, making better use of their shared structure. Further, the distributedness of linguistic processing increases with pre-training through increased parameter sharing between related linguistic tasks. The overall generalisation patterns are mostly stable throughout training and not marked by incisive stages, potentially explaining the lack of successful curriculum strategies for LMs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.248	Lucas Weber, Jaap Jumelet, Elia Bruni, Dieuwke Hupkes
Exploiting Intrinsic Multilateral Logical Rules for Weakly Supervised Natural Language Video Localization	Weakly supervised natural language video localization (WS-NLVL) aims to retrieve the moment corresponding to a language query in a video with only video-language pairs utilized during training. Despite great success, existing WS-NLVL methods seldomly consider the complex temporal relations enclosing the language query (e.g., between the language query and sub-queries decomposed from it or its synonymous query), yielding illogical predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play method, Intrinsic Multilateral Logical Rules, namely IMLR, to exploit intrinsic temporal relations and logical rules for WS-NLVL. Specifically, we formalize queries derived from the original language query as the nodes of a directed graph, i.e., intrinsic temporal relation graph (ITRG), and the temporal relations between them as the edges. Instead of directly prompting a pre-trained language model, a relation-guided prompting method is introduced to generate ITRG in a hierarchical manner. We customize four types of multilateral temporal logical rules (i.e., identity, inclusion, synchronization, and succession) from ITRG and utilize them to train our model. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method on the Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions datasets.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.247	Zhe Xu, Kun Wei, Xu Yang, Cheng Deng
Analyzing Semantic Change through Lexical Replacements	Modern language models are capable of contextualizing words based on their surrounding context. However, this capability is often compromised due to semantic change that leads to words being used in new, unexpected contexts not encountered during pre-training. In this paper, we model semantic change by studying the effect of unexpected contexts introduced by lexical replacements. We propose a replacement schema where a target word is substituted with lexical replacements of varying relatedness, thus simulating different kinds of semantic change. Furthermore, we leverage the replacement schema as a basis for a novel interpretable model for semantic change. We are also the first to evaluate the use of LLaMa for semantic change detection.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.246	Francesco Periti, Pierluigi Cassotti, Haim Dubossarsky, Nina Tahmasebi
Graph Language Models	While Language Models (LMs) are the workhorses of NLP, their interplay with structured knowledge graphs (KGs) is still actively researched. Current methods for encoding such graphs typically either (i) linearize them for embedding with LMs – which underutilize structural information, or (ii) use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to preserve the graph structure – but GNNs cannot represent text features as well as pretrained LMs. In our work we introduce a novel LM type, the Graph Language Model (GLM), that integrates the strengths of both approaches and mitigates their weaknesses. The GLM parameters are initialized from a pretrained LM to enhance understanding of individual graph concepts and triplets. Simultaneously, we design the GLM's architecture to incorporate graph biases, thereby promoting effective knowledge distribution within the graph. This enables GLMs to process graphs, texts, and interleaved inputs of both. Empirical evaluations on relation classification tasks show that GLM embeddings surpass both LM- and GNN-based baselines in supervised and zero-shot setting, demonstrating their versatility.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.245	Moritz Plenz, Anette Frank
LLM-based Rewriting of Inappropriate Argumentation using Reinforcement Learning from Machine Feedback	Ensuring that online discussions are civil and productive is a major challenge for social media platforms. Such platforms usually rely both on users and on automated detection tools to flag inappropriate arguments of other users, which moderators then review. However, this kind of post-hoc moderation is expensive and time-consuming, and moderators are often overwhelmed by the amount and severity of flagged content. Instead, a promising alternative is to prevent negative behavior during content creation. This paper studies how inappropriate language in arguments can be computationally mitigated. We propose a reinforcement learning-based rewriting approach that balances content preservation and appropriateness based on existing classifiers, prompting an instruction-finetuned large language model (LLM) as our initial policy. Unlike related style transfer tasks, rewriting inappropriate arguments allows deleting and adding content permanently. It is therefore tackled on document level rather than sentence level. We evaluate different weighting schemes for the reward function in both absolute and relative human assessment studies. Systematic experiments on non-parallel data provide evidence that our approach can mitigate the inappropriateness of arguments while largely preserving their content. It significantly outperforms competitive baselines, including few-shot learning, prompting, and humans.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.244	Timon Ziegenbein, Gabriella Skitalinskaya, Alireza Bayat Makou, Henning Wachsmuth
Favi-Score: A Measure for Favoritism in Automated Preference Ratings for Generative AI Evaluation	Generative AI systems have become ubiquitous for all kinds of modalities, which makes the issue of the evaluation of such models more pressing. One popular approach is preference ratings, where the generated outputs of different systems are shown to evaluators who choose their preferences. In recent years the field shifted towards the development of automated (trained) metrics to assess generated outputs, which can be used to create preference ratings automatically. In this work, we investigate the evaluation of the metrics themselves, which currently rely on measuring the correlation to human judgments or computing sign accuracy scores. These measures only assess how well the metric agrees with the human ratings. However, our research shows that this does not tell the whole story. Most metrics exhibit a disagreement with human system assessments which is often skewed in favor of particular text generation systems, exposing a degree of favoritism in automated metrics. This paper introduces a formal definition of favoritism in preference metrics, and derives the Favi-Score, which measures this phenomenon. In particular we show that favoritism is strongly related to errors in final system rankings. Thus, we propose that preference-based metrics ought to be evaluated on both sign accuracy scores and favoritism.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.243	Pius Von Däniken, Jan Deriu, Don Tuggener, Mark Cieliebak
Small Models, Big Insights: Leveraging Slim Proxy Models To Decide When and What to Retrieve for LLMs	The integration of large language models (LLMs) and search engines represents a significant evolution in knowledge acquisition methodologies. However, determining the knowledge that an LLM already possesses and the knowledge that requires the help of a search engine remains an unresolved issue. Most existing methods solve this problem through the results of preliminary answers or reasoning done by the LLM itself, but this incurs excessively high computational costs. This paper introduces a novel collaborative approach, namely SlimPLM, that detects missing knowledge in LLMs with a slim proxy model, to enhance the LLM's knowledge acquisition process. We employ a proxy model which has far fewer parameters, and take its answers as heuristic answers. Heuristic answers are then utilized to predict the knowledge required to answer the user question, as well as the known and unknown knowledge within the LLM. We only conduct retrieval for the missing knowledge in questions that the LLM does not know. Extensive experimental results on five datasets with two LLMs demonstrate a notable improvement in the end-to-end performance of LLMs in question-answering tasks, achieving or surpassing current state-of-the-art models with lower LLM inference costs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.242	Jiejun Tan, Zhicheng Dou, Yutao Zhu, Peidong Guo, Kun Fang, Ji-Rong Wen
Uncovering the Full Potential of Visual Grounding Methods in VQA	Visual Grounding (VG) methods in Visual Question Answering (VQA) attempt to improve VQA performance by strengthening a model's reliance on question-relevant visual information. The presence of such relevant information in the visual input is typically assumed in training and testing. This assumption, however, is inherently flawed when dealing with imperfect image representations common in large-scale VQA, where the information carried by visual features frequently deviates from expected ground-truth contents. As a result, training and testing of VG-methods is performed with largely inaccurate data, which obstructs proper assessment of their potential benefits.In this study, we demonstrate that current evaluation schemes for VG-methods are problematic due to the flawed assumption of availability of relevant visual information. Our experiments show that these methods can be much more effective when evaluation conditions are corrected. Code is provided.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.241	Daniel Reich, Tanja Schultz
Missci: Reconstructing Fallacies in Misrepresented Science	"Health-related misinformation on social networks can lead to poor decision-making and real-world dangers. Such misinformation often misrepresents scientific publications and cites them as ""proof"" to gain perceived credibility. To effectively counter such claims automatically, a system must explain how the claim was falsely derived from the cited publication. Current methods for automated fact-checking or fallacy detection neglect to assess the (mis)used evidence in relation to misinformation claims, which is required to detect the mismatch between them. To address this gap, we introduce Missci, a novel argumentation theoretical model for fallacious reasoning together with a new dataset for real-world misinformation detection that misrepresents biomedical publications. Unlike previous fallacy detection datasets, Missci (i) focuses on implicit fallacies between the relevant content of the cited publication and the inaccurate claim, and (ii) requires models to verbalize the fallacious reasoning in addition to classifying it. We present Missci as a dataset to test the critical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), that are required to reconstruct real-world fallacious arguments, in a zero-shot setting. We evaluate two representative LLMs and the impact of different levels of detail about the fallacy classes provided to the LLM via prompts. Our experiments and human evaluation show promising results for GPT 4, while also demonstrating the difficulty of this task."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.240	Max Glockner, Yufang Hou, Preslav Nakov, Iryna Gurevych
Uncertainty-Guided Modal Rebalance for Hateful Memes Detection	Hateful memes detection is a challenging multimodal understanding task that requires comprehensive learning of vision, language, and cross-modal interactions. Previous research has focused on developing effective fusion strategies for integrating hate information from different modalities. However, these methods excessively rely on cross-modal fusion features, ignoring the modality uncertainty caused by the contribution degree of each modality to hate sentiment and the modality imbalance caused by the dominant modality suppressing the optimization of another modality. To this end, this paper proposes an Uncertainty-guided Modal Rebalance (UMR) framework for hateful memes detection. The uncertainty of each meme is explicitly formulated by designing stochastic representation drawn from a Gaussian distribution for aggregating cross-modal features with unimodal features adaptively. The modality imbalance is alleviated by improving cosine loss from the perspectives of inter-modal feature and weight vectors constraints. In this way, the suppressed unimodal representation ability in multimodal models would be unleashed, while the learning of modality contribution would be further promoted. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed UMR produces the state-of-the-art performance on four widely-used datasets.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.239	Chuanpeng Yang, Yaxin Liu, Fuqing Zhu, Jizhong Han, Songlin Hu
SAC-KG: Exploiting Large Language Models as Skilled Automatic Constructors for Domain Knowledge Graph	Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a pivotal role in knowledge-intensive tasks across specialized domains, where the acquisition of precise and dependable knowledge is crucial. However, existing KG construction methods heavily rely on human intervention to attain qualified KGs, which severely hinders the practical applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a general KG construction framework, named **SAC-KG**, to exploit large language models (LLMs) as **S**killed **A**utomatic **C**onstructors for domain **K**nowledge **G**raph. SAC-KG effectively involves LLMs as domain experts to generate specialized and precise multi-level KGs. Specifically, SAC-KG consists of three components: Generator, Verifier, and Pruner. For a given entity, Generator produces its relations and tails from raw domain corpora, to construct a specialized single-level KG. Verifier and Pruner then work together to ensure precision by correcting generation errors and determining whether newly produced tails require further iteration for the next-level KG. Experiments demonstrate that SAC-KG automatically constructs a domain KG at the scale of over one million nodes and achieves a precision of 89.32%, leading to a superior performance with over 20% increase in precision rate compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for the KG construction task.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.238	Hanzhu Chen, Xu Shen, Qitan Lv, Jie Wang, Xiaoqi Ni, Jieping Ye
Strengthened Symbol Binding Makes Large Language Models Reliable Multiple-Choice Selectors	Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) constitute a critical area of research in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs). Previous works have investigated the selection bias problem in MCQs within few-shot scenarios, in which the LLM's performance may be influenced by the presentation of answer choices, leaving the selection bias during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) unexplored. In this paper, we reveal that selection bias persists in the SFT phase , primarily due to the LLM's inadequate Multiple Choice Symbol Binding (MCSB) ability. This limitation implies that the model struggles to associate the answer options with their corresponding symbols (e.g., A/B/C/D) effectively. To enhance the model's MCSB capability, we first incorporate option contents into the loss function and subsequently adjust the weights of the option symbols and contents, guiding the model to understand the option content of the current symbol. Based on this, we introduce an efficient SFT algorithm for MCQs, termed Point-wise Intelligent Feedback (PIF). PIF constructs negative instances by randomly combin- ing the incorrect option contents with all candidate symbols, and proposes a point-wise loss to provide feedback on these negative samples into LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that PIF significantly reduces the model's selection bias by improving its MCSB capability. Remarkably, PIF exhibits a substantial enhancement in the accuracy for MCQs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.237	Mengge Xue, Zhenyu Hu, Liqun Liu, Kuo Liao, Shuang Li, Honglin Han, Meng Zhao, Chengguo Yin
DAPR: A Benchmark on Document-Aware Passage Retrieval	The work of neural retrieval so far focuses on ranking short texts and is challenged with long documents. There are many cases where the users want to find a relevant passage within a long document from a huge corpus, e.g. Wikipedia articles, research papers, etc. We propose and name this task Document-Aware Passage Retrieval (DAPR). While analyzing the errors of the State-of-The-Art (SoTA) passage retrievers, we find the major errors (53.5%) are due to missing document context. This drives us to build a benchmark for this task including multiple datasets from heterogeneous domains. In the experiments, we extend the SoTA passage retrievers with document context via (1) hybrid retrieval with BM25 and (2) contextualized passage representations, which inform the passage representation with document context. We find despite that hybrid retrieval performs the strongest on the mixture of the easy and the hard queries, it completely fails on the hard queries that require document-context understanding. On the other hand, contextualized passage representations (e.g. prepending document titles) achieve good improvement on these hard queries, but overall they also perform rather poorly. Our created benchmark enables future research on developing and comparing retrieval systems for the new task. The code and the data are available.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.236	Kexin Wang, Nils Reimers, Iryna Gurevych
CoGenesis: A Framework Collaborating Large and Small Language Models for Secure Context-Aware Instruction Following	With the advancement of language models (LMs), their exposure to private data is increasingly inevitable, and their deployment (especially for smaller ones) on personal devices, such as PCs and smartphones, has become a prevailing trend. In contexts laden with user information, enabling models to both safeguard user privacy and execute commands efficiently emerges as an essential research imperative. In this paper, we propose CoGenesis, a collaborative generation framework integrating large (hosted on cloud infrastructure) and small models (deployed on local devices) to address privacy concerns logically. Initially, we design a pipeline to create personalized writing instruction datasets enriched with extensive context details as the testbed of this research issue. Subsequently, we introduce two variants of CoGenesis based on sketch and logits respectively. Our experimental findings, based on our synthesized dataset and two additional open-source datasets, indicate that: 1) Large-scale models perform well when provided with user context but struggle in the absence of such context. 2) While specialized smaller models fine-tuned on the synthetic dataset show promise, they still lag behind their larger counterparts. 3) Our CoGenesis framework, utilizing mixed-scale models, showcases competitive performance, providing a feasible solution to privacy issues.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.235	Kaiyan Zhang, Jianyu Wang, Ermo Hua, Biqing Qi, Ning Ding, Bowen Zhou
InfoLossQA: Characterizing and Recovering Information Loss in Text Simplification	Text simplification aims to make technical texts more accessible to laypeople but often results in deletion of information and vagueness. This work proposes InfoLossQA, a framework to characterize and recover simplification-induced information loss in form of question-and-answer (QA) pairs. Building on the theory of Questions Under Discussion, the QA pairs are designed to help readers deepen their knowledge of a text. First, we collect a dataset of 1,000 linguist-curated QA pairs derived from 104 LLM simplifications of English medical study abstracts. Our analyses of this data reveal that information loss occurs frequently, and that the QA pairs give a high-level overview of what information was lost. Second, we devise two methods for this task: end-to-end prompting of open-source and commercial language models, and a natural language inference pipeline. With a novel evaluation framework considering the correctness of QA pairs and their linguistic suitability, our expert evaluation reveals that models struggle to reliably identify information loss and applying similar standards as humans at what constitutes information loss.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.234	Jan Trienes, Sebastian Joseph, Jörg Schlötterer, Christin Seifert, Kyle Lo, Wei Xu, Byron Wallace, Junyi Jessy Li
CoCA: Fusing Position Embedding with Collinear Constrained Attention in Transformers for Long Context Window Extending	Self-attention and position embedding are two crucial modules in transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the potential relationship between them is far from well studied, especially for long context window extending. In fact, anomalous behaviors that hinder long context extrapolation exist between Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and vanilla self-attention.Incorrect initial angles between Q and K can cause misestimation in modeling rotary position embedding of the closest tokens.To address this issue, we propose Co llinear C onstrained A ttention mechanism, namely CoCA. Specifically, we enforce a collinear constraint between Q and K to seamlessly integrate RoPE and self-attention.While only adding minimal computational and spatial complexity, this integration significantly enhances long context window extrapolation ability. We provide an optimized implementation, making it a drop-in replacement for any existing transformer-based models.Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoCA excels in extending context windows. A CoCA-based GPT model, trained with a context length of 512, can extend the context window up to 32K (60 × ) without any fine-tuning.Additionally, incorporating CoCA into LLaMA-7B achieves extrapolation up to 32K within a training length of only 2K.Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/codefuse-ai/Collinear-Constrained-Attention	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.233	Shiyi Zhu, Jing Ye, Wei Jiang, Siqiao Xue, Qi Zhang, Yifan Wu, Jianguo Li
Intuitive or Dependent? Investigating LLMs’ Behavior Style to Conflicting Prompts	This study investigates the behaviors of Large Language Models (LLMs) when faced with conflicting prompts versus their internal memory. This will not only help to understand LLMs' decision mechanism but also benefit real-world applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).Drawing on cognitive theory, we target the first scenario of decision-making styles where there is no superiority in the conflict and categorize LLMs' preference into dependent, intuitive, and rational/irrational styles.Another scenario of factual robustness considers the correctness of prompt and memory in knowledge-intensive tasks, which can also distinguish if LLMs behave rationally or irrationally in the first scenario.To quantify them, we establish a complete benchmarking framework including a dataset, a robustness evaluation pipeline, and corresponding metrics. Extensive experiments with seven LLMs reveal their varying behaviors. And, with role play intervention, we can change the styles, but different models present distinct adaptivity and upper-bound. One of our key takeaways is to optimize models or the prompts according to the identified style. For instance, RAG models with high role play adaptability may dynamically adjust the interventions according to the quality of retrieval results — being dependent to better leverage informative context; and, being intuitive when external prompt is noisy.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.232	Jiahao Ying, Yixin Cao, Kai Xiong, Long Cui, Yidong He, Yongbin Liu
Enhancing Reinforcement Learning with Label-Sensitive Reward for Natural Language Understanding	Recent strides in large language models (LLMs) have yielded remarkable performance, leveraging reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to significantly enhance generation and alignment capabilities. However, RLHF encounters numerous challenges, including the objective mismatch issue, leading to suboptimal performance in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks.To address this limitation, we propose a novel Reinforcement Learning framework enhanced with Label-sensitive Reward (RLLR) to amplify the performance of LLMs in NLU tasks. By incorporating label-sensitive pairs into reinforcement learning, our method aims to adeptly capture nuanced label-sensitive semantic features during RL, thereby enhancing natural language understanding.Experiments conducted on five diverse foundation models across eight tasks showcase promising results. In comparison to Supervised Fine-tuning models (SFT), RLLR demonstrates an average performance improvement of 1.54%. Compared with RLHF models, the improvement averages at 0.69%. These results reveal the effectiveness of our method for LLMs in NLU tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.231	Kuo Liao, Shuang Li, Meng Zhao, Liqun Liu, Mengge Xue, Zhenyu Hu, Honglin Han, Chengguo Yin
Transferable Embedding Inversion Attack: Uncovering Privacy Risks in Text Embeddings without Model Queries	This study investigates the privacy risks associated with text embeddings, focusing on the scenario where attackers cannot access the original embedding model. Contrary to previous research requiring direct model access, we explore a more realistic threat model by developing a transfer attack method. This approach uses a surrogate model to mimic the victim model's behavior, allowing the attacker to infer sensitive information from text embeddings without direct access. Our experiments across various embedding models and a clinical dataset demonstrate that our transfer attack significantly outperforms traditional methods, revealing the potential privacy vulnerabilities in embedding technologies and emphasizing the need for enhanced security measures.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.230	Yu-Hsiang Huang, Yuche Tsai, Hsiang Hsiao, Hong-Yi Lin, Shou-De Lin
Respond in my Language: Mitigating Language Inconsistency in Response Generation based on Large Language Models	Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong instruction understanding ability across multiple languages. However, they are easily biased towards English in instruction tuning, and generate English responses even given non-English instructions. In this paper, we investigate the language inconsistent generation problem in monolingual instruction tuning. We find that instruction tuning in English increases the models' preference for English responses. It attaches higher probabilities to English responses than to responses in the same language as the instruction. Based on the findings, we alleviate the language inconsistent generation problem by counteracting the model preference for English responses in both the training and inference stages. Specifically, we propose Pseudo-Inconsistent Penalization (PIP) which prevents the model from generating English responses when given non-English language prompts during training, and Prior Enhanced Decoding (PED) which improves the language-consistent prior by leveraging the untuned base language model. Experimental results show that our two methods significantly improve the language consistency of the model without requiring any multilingual data. Our code, data, and models will be released.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.229	Liang Zhang, Qin Jin, Haoyang Huang, Dongdong Zhang, Furu Wei
In-context Mixing (ICM): Code-mixed Prompts for Multilingual LLMs	We introduce a simple and effective prompting technique called in-context mixing (ICM) for effective in-context learning (ICL) with multilingual large language models (MLLMs). With ICM, we modify the few-shot examples within ICL prompts to be intra-sententially code-mixed by randomly swapping content words in the target languages with their English translations. We observe that ICM prompts yield superior performance in NLP tasks such as disfluency correction, grammar error correction and text simplification that demand a close correspondence between the input and output sequences. Significant improvements are observed mainly for low-resource languages that are under-represented during the pretraining and finetuning of MLLMs. We present an extensive set of experiments to analyze when ICM is effective and what design choices contribute towards its effectiveness. ICM works consistently and significantly better than other prompting techniques across models of varying capacity such as mT0-XXL, BloomZ and GPT-4.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.228	Bhavani Shankar, Preethi Jyothi, Pushpak Bhattacharyya
Multi-Level Feedback Generation with Large Language Models for Empowering Novice Peer Counselors	Realistic practice and tailored feedback are key processes for training peer counselors with clinical skills. However, existing mechanisms of providing feedback largely rely on human supervision. Peer counselors often lack mechanisms to receive detailed feedback from experienced mentors, making it difficult for them to support the large number of people with mental health issues who use peer counseling. Our work aims to leverage large language models to provide contextualized and multi-level feedback to empower peer counselors, especially novices, at scale. To achieve this, we co-design with a group of senior psychotherapy supervisors to develop a multi-level feedback taxonomy, and then construct a publicly available dataset with comprehensive feedback annotations of 400 emotional support conversations. We further design a self-improvement method on top of large language models to enhance the automatic generation of feedback. Via qualitative and quantitative evaluation with domain experts, we demonstrate that our method minimizes the risk of potentially harmful and low-quality feedback generation which is desirable in such high-stakes scenarios.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.227	Alicja Chaszczewicz, Raj Shah, Ryan Louie, Bruce Arnow, Robert Kraut, Diyi Yang
Can Watermarks Survive Translation? On the Cross-lingual Consistency of Text Watermark for Large Language Models	Text watermarking technology aims to tag and identify content produced by large language models (LLMs) to prevent misuse. In this study, we introduce the concept of cross-lingual consistency in text watermarking, which assesses the ability of text watermarks to maintain their effectiveness after being translated into other languages. Preliminary empirical results from two LLMs and three watermarking methods reveal that current text watermarking technologies lack consistency when texts are translated into various languages. Based on this observation, we propose a Cross-lingual Watermark Removal Attack (CWRA) to bypass watermarking by first obtaining a response from an LLM in a pivot language, which is then translated into the target language. CWRA can effectively remove watermarks, decreasing the AUCs to a random-guessing level without performance loss. Furthermore, we analyze two key factors that contribute to the cross-lingual consistency in text watermarking and propose X-SIR as a defense method against CWRA.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.226	Zhiwei He, Binglin Zhou, Hongkun Hao, Aiwei Liu, Xing Wang, Zhaopeng Tu, Zhuosheng Zhang, Rui Wang
MAVEN-ARG: Completing the Puzzle of All-in-One Event Understanding Dataset with Event Argument Annotation	Understanding events in texts is a core objective of natural language understanding, which requires detecting event occurrences, extracting event arguments, and analyzing inter-event relationships. However, due to the annotation challenges brought by task complexity, a large-scale dataset covering the full process of event understanding has long been absent. In this paper, we introduce MAVEN-Arg, which augments MAVEN datasets with event argument annotations, making the first all-in-one dataset supporting event detection, event argument extraction (EAE), and event relation extraction. As an EAE benchmark, MAVEN-Arg offers three main advantages: (1) a comprehensive schema covering 162 event types and 612 argument roles, all with expert-written definitions and examples; (2) a large data scale, containing 98,591 events and 290,613 arguments obtained with laborious human annotation; (3) the exhaustive annotation supporting all task variants of EAE, which annotates both entity and non-entity event arguments in document level. Experiments indicate that MAVEN-Arg is quite challenging for both fine-tuned EAE models and proprietary large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, to demonstrate the benefits of an all-in-one dataset, we preliminarily explore a potential application, future event prediction, with LLMs. MAVEN-Arg and codes can be obtained from https://github.com/THU-KEG/MAVEN-Argument.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.224	Xiaozhi Wang, Hao Peng, Yong Guan, Kaisheng Zeng, Jianhui Chen, Lei Hou, Xu Han, Yankai Lin, Zhiyuan Liu, Ruobing Xie, Jie Zhou, Juanzi Li
NPHardEval: Dynamic Benchmark on Reasoning Ability of Large Language Models via Complexity Classes	Complex reasoning ability is one of the most important features of Large Language Models (LLMs). Numerous benchmarks have been established to assess the reasoning abilities of LLMs. However, they are inadequate in offering a rigorous evaluation and prone to the risk of overfitting, as these publicly accessible and static benchmarks allow models to potentially tailor their responses to specific benchmark metrics, thereby inflating their performance. Addressing these limitations, we introduce a new benchmark NPHardEval. It contains a broad spectrum of 900 algorithmic questions belonging up to the NP-Hard complexity class, offering a rigorous measure of the reasoning ability of LLMs utilizing computational complexity. Moreover, this benchmark is designed with a dynamic update mechanism, where the datapoints are refreshed on a monthly basis. Such regular updates play a crucial role in mitigating the risk of LLMs overfitting to the benchmark, promoting a more accurate and reliable assessment of their reasoning capabilities. The benchmark dataset and code of NPHardEval are available at https://github.com/casmlab/NPHardEval.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.225	Lizhou Fan, Wenyue Hua, Lingyao Li, Haoyang Ling, Yongfeng Zhang
CaMML: Context-Aware Multimodal Learner for Large Models	In this work, we introduce Context-Aware MultiModal Learner (CaMML), for tuning large multimodal models (LMMs). CaMML, a lightweight module, is crafted to seamlessly integrate multimodal contextual samples into large models, thereby empowering the model to derive knowledge from analogous, domain-specific, up-to-date information and make grounded inferences. Importantly, CaMML is highly scalable and can efficiently handle lengthy multimodal context examples owing to its hierarchical design. Based on CaMML, we have developed two multimodal models, CaMML-7B and CaMML-13B, that have shown exceptional performance across an array of benchmark datasets for multimodal tasks. Remarkably, CaMML-13B achieves the state-of-the-art performance on over ten widely recognized multimodal benchmark datasets, surpassing LLaVA-1.5 (13B) with a noticeable margin, without integration of any external resources. Moreover, we have conducted extensive ablative studies to inspect the inner workings of CaMML and performed qualitative analyses to showcase its effectiveness in handling real-world challenging cases.

Learning Global Controller in Latent Space for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning	While large language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable prowess in various natural language processing tasks, their training costs are exorbitant. Consequently, a plethora of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have emerged to tailor large models for downstream tasks, including low-rank training. Recent approaches either amalgamate existing fine-tuning methods or dynamically adjust rank allocation. Nonetheless, these methods continue to grapple with issues like local optimization, inability to train with full rank and lack of focus on specific tasks. In this paper, we introduce an innovative parameter-efficient method for exploring optimal solutions within latent space. More specifically, we introduce a set of latent units designed to iteratively extract input representations from LLMs, continuously refining informative features that enhance downstream task performance. Due to the small and independent nature of the latent units in relation to input size, this significantly reduces training memory requirements. Additionally, we employ an asymmetric attention mechanism to facilitate bidirectional interaction between latent units and freezed LLM representations, thereby mitigating issues associated with non-full-rank training. Furthermore, we apply distillation over hidden states during the interaction, which guarantees a trimmed number of trainable parameters.Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of natural language understanding, generation and reasoning tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.222	Zeqi Tan, Yongliang Shen, Xiaoxia Cheng, Chang Zong, Wenqi Zhang, Jian Shao, Weiming Lu, Yueting Zhuang
Rule or Story, Which is a Better Commonsense Expression for Talking with Large Language Models?	Building machines with commonsense has been a longstanding challenge in NLP due to the reporting bias of commonsense rules and the exposure bias of rule-based commonsense reasoning. In contrast, humans convey and pass down commonsense implicitly through stories. This paper investigates the inherent commonsense ability of large language models (LLMs) expressed through storytelling. We systematically investigate and compare stories and rules for retrieving and leveraging commonsense in LLMs. Experimental results on 28 commonsense QA datasets show that stories outperform rules as the expression for retrieving commonsense from LLMs, exhibiting higher generation confidence and commonsense accuracy. Moreover, stories are the more effective commonsense expression for answering questions regarding daily events, while rules are more effective for scientific questions. This aligns with the reporting bias of commonsense in text corpora. We further show that the correctness and relevance of commonsense stories can be further improved via iterative self-supervised fine-tuning. These findings emphasize the importance of using appropriate language to express, retrieve, and leverage commonsense for LLMs, highlighting a promising direction for better exploiting their commonsense abilities.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.221	Ning Bian, Xianpei Han, Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Ben He, Le Sun
SoftDedup: an Efficient Data Reweighting Method for Speeding Up Language Model Pre-training	"The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) is often hindered by duplicated data in their extensive pre-training datasets. Current approaches primarily focus on detecting and removing duplicates, which risks the loss of valuable information and neglects the varying degrees of duplication. To address this, we propose a soft deduplication method that maintains dataset integrity while selectively reducing the sampling weight of data with high commonness. Central to our approach is the concept of ""data commonness"", a metric we introduce to quantify the degree of duplication by measuring the occurrence probabilities of samples using an n-gram model. Empirical analysis shows that this method significantly improves training efficiency, achieving comparable perplexity scores with at least a 26% reduction in required training steps. Additionally, it enhances average few-shot downstream accuracy by 1.77% when trained for an equivalent duration. Importantly, this approach consistently improves performance, even on rigorously deduplicated datasets, indicating its potential to complement existing methods and become a standard pre-training process for LLMs."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.220	Nan He, Weichen Xiong, Hanwen Liu, Yi Liao, Lei Ding, Kai Zhang, Guohua Tang, Xiao Han, Yang Wei
Instruct Once, Chat Consistently in Multiple Rounds: An Efficient Tuning Framework for Dialogue	Tuning language models for dialogue generation has been a prevalent paradigm for building capable dialogue agents. Yet, traditional tuning narrowly views dialogue generation as resembling other language generation tasks, ignoring the role disparities between two speakers and the multi-round interactive process that dialogues ought to be. Such a manner often leads to unsatisfactory chat consistency for the built agent. In this work, we emphasize the interactive, communicative nature of dialogue and argue that it is more feasible to model the speaker roles of agent and user separately, enabling the agent to adhere to its role consistently. With this in mind, we propose an efficient Multi-round Interactive Dialogue Tuning (Midi-Tuning) framework. It models the agent and user individually with two adapters built upon large language models. The adapters make use of respective utterances round by round in alternating order and they are tuned via a round-level memory caching mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, our framework performs superior to traditional fine-tuning and harbors the tremendous potential for improving dialogue consistency.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.219	Jian Wang, Chak Tou Leong, Jiashuo Wang, Dongding Lin, Wenjie Li, Xiaoyong Wei
M4GT-Bench: Evaluation Benchmark for Black-Box Machine-Generated Text Detection	The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought an unprecedented surge in machine-generated text (MGT) across diverse channels. This raises legitimate concerns about its potential misuse and societal implications. The need to identify and differentiate such content from genuine human-generated text is critical in combating disinformation, preserving the integrity of education and scientific fields, and maintaining trust in communication. In this work, we address this problem by introducing a new benchmark based on a multilingual, multi-domain and multi-generator corpus of MGTs — M4GT-Bench. The benchmark is compiled of three tasks: (1) mono-lingual and multi-lingual binary MGT detection; (2) multi-way detection where one need to identify, which particular model generated the text; and (3) mixed human-machine text detection, where a word boundary delimiting MGT from human-written content should be determined. On the developed benchmark, we have tested several MGT detection baselines and also conducted an evaluation of human performance. We see that obtaining good performance in MGT detection usually requires an access to the training data from the same domain and generators. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/M4GT-Bench.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.218	Yuxia Wang, Jonibek Mansurov, Petar Ivanov, Jinyan Su, Artem Shelmanov, Akim Tsvigun, Osama Mohammed Afzal, Tarek Mahmoud, Giovanni Puccetti, Thomas Arnold, Alham Aji, Nizar Habash, Iryna Gurevych, Preslav Nakov
Towards Real-world Scenario: Imbalanced New Intent Discovery	New Intent Discovery (NID) aims at detecting known and previously undefined categories of user intent by utilizing limited labeled and massive unlabeled data. Most prior works often operate under the unrealistic assumption that the distribution of both familiar and new intent classes is uniform, overlooking the skewed and long-tailed distributions frequently encountered in real-world scenarios. To bridge the gap, our work introduces the imbalanced new intent discovery i-NID task, which seeks to identify familiar and novel intent categories within long-tailed distributions. A new benchmark baNID-Bench comprised of three datasets is created to simulate the real-world long-tail distributions. ImbaNID-Bench ranges from broad cross-domain to specific single-domain intent categories, providing a thorough representation of practical use cases. Besides, a robust baseline model ImbaNID is proposed to achieve cluster-friendly intent representations. It includes three stages: model pre-training, generation of reliable pseudo-labels, and robust representation learning that strengthens the model performance to handle the intricacies of real-world data distributions. Our extensive experiments on previous benchmarks and the newly established benchmark demonstrate the superior performance of ImbaNID in addressing the i-NID task, highlighting its potential as a powerful baseline for uncovering and categorizing user intents in imbalanced and long-tailed distributions.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.217	Shun Zhang, Yan Chaoran, Jian Yang, Jiaheng Liu, Ying Mo, Jiaqi Bai, Tongliang Li, Zhoujun Li
Exploring Memorization in Fine-tuned Language Models	Large language models (LLMs) have shown great capabilities in various tasks but also exhibited memorization of training data, raising tremendous privacy and copyright concerns. While prior works have studied memorization during pre-training, the exploration of memorization during fine-tuning is rather limited. Compared to pre-training, fine-tuning typically involves more sensitive data and diverse objectives, thus may bring distinct privacy risks and unique memorization behaviors. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis to explore language models' (LMs) memorization during fine-tuning across tasks. Our studies with open-sourced and our own fine-tuned LMs across various tasks indicate that memorization presents a strong disparity among different fine-tuning tasks. We provide an intuitive explanation of this task disparity via sparse coding theory and unveil a strong correlation between memorization and attention score distribution.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.216	Shenglai Zeng, Yaxin Li, Jie Ren, Yiding Liu, Han Xu, Pengfei He, Yue Xing, Shuaiqiang Wang, Jiliang Tang, Dawei Yin
TimeArena: Shaping Efficient Multitasking Language Agents in a Time-Aware Simulation	Despite remarkable advancements in emulating human-like behavior through Large Language Models (LLMs), current textual simulations do not adequately address the notion of time. To this end, we introduce TimeArena, a novel textual simulated environment that incorporates complex temporal dynamics and constraints that better reflect real-life planning scenarios. In TimeArena, agents are asked to complete multiple tasks as soon as possible, allowing for parallel processing to save time. We implement the dependency between actions, the time duration for each action, and the occupancy of the agent and the objects in the environment. TimeArena grounds to 30 real-world tasks in cooking, household activity, and laboratory work. We conduct extensive experiments with various LLMs using TimeArena. Our findings reveal that even the most powerful models, e.g., GPT-4, still lag behind humans in effective multitasking, underscoring the need for enhanced temporal awareness in the development of language agents.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.215	Yikai Zhang, Siyu Yuan, Caiyu Hu, Kyle Richardson, Yanghua Xiao, Jiangjie Chen
Instruction Fusion: Advancing Prompt Evolution through Hybridization	The fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) specialized in code generation has seen notable advancements through the use of open-domain coding queries. Despite the successes, existing methodologies like Evol-Instruct encounter performance limitations, impeding further enhancements in code generation tasks. This paper examines the constraints of existing prompt evolution techniques and introduces a novel approach, Instruction Fusion (IF). IF innovatively combines two distinct prompts through a hybridization process, thereby enhancing the evolution of training prompts for code LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed novel method effectively addresses the shortcomings of prior methods, significantly improving the performance of Code LLMs across five code generation benchmarks, namely HumanEval, HumanEval+, MBPP, MBPP+ and MultiPL-E, which underscore the effectiveness of Instruction Fusion in advancing the capabilities of LLMs in code generation.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.214	Weidong Guo, Jiuding Yang, Kaitong Yang, Xiangyang Li, Zhuwei Rao, Yu Xu, Di Niu
Semiparametric Token-Sequence Co-Supervision	In this work, we introduce a semiparametric token-sequence co-supervision training method. It trains a language model by simultaneously leveraging supervision from the traditional next token prediction loss which is calculated over the parametric token embedding space and the next sequence prediction loss which is calculated over the nonparametric sequence embedding space. The nonparametric sequence embedding space is constructed by a separate language model tasked to condense an input text into a single representative embedding. Our experiments demonstrate that a model trained via both supervisions consistently surpasses models trained via each supervision independently. Analysis suggests that this co-supervision encourages a broader generalization capability across the model. Especially, the robustness of parametric token space which is established during the pretraining step tends to effectively enhance the stability of nonparametric sequence embedding space, a new space established by another language model.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.213	Hyunji Lee, Doyoung Kim, Jihoon Jun, Se June Joo, Joel Jang, Kyoung-Woon On, Minjoon Seo
Insert or Attach: Taxonomy Completion via Box Embedding	Taxonomy completion, enriching existing taxonomies by inserting new concepts as parents or attaching them as children, has gained significant interest. Previous approaches embed concepts as vectors in Euclidean space, which makes it difficult to model asymmetric relations in taxonomy. In addition, they introduce pseudo-leaves to convert attachment cases into insertion cases, leading to an incorrect bias in network learning dominated by numerous pseudo-leaves. Addressing these, our framework, TaxBox, leverages box containment and center closeness to design two specialized geometric scorers within the box embedding space. These scorers are tailored for insertion and attachment operations and can effectively capture intrinsic relationships between concepts by optimizing on a granular box constraint loss. We employ a dynamic ranking loss mechanism to balance the scores from these scorers, allowing adaptive adjustments of insertion and attachment scores. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that TaxBox significantly outperforms previous methods, yielding substantial improvements over prior methods in real-world datasets, with average performance boosts of 6.7%, 34.9%, and 51.4% in MRR, Hit@1, and Prec@1, respectively.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.212	Wei Xue, Yongliang Shen, Wenqi Ren, Jietian Guo, Shiliang Pu, Weiming Lu
OlympiadBench: A Challenging Benchmark for Promoting AGI with Olympiad-Level Bilingual Multimodal Scientific Problems	"Recent advancements have seen Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) surpassing general human capabilities in various tasks, approaching the proficiency level of human experts across multiple domains. With traditional benchmarks becoming less challenging for these models, new rigorous challenges are essential to gauge their advanced abilities. In this work, we present OlympiadBench, an Olympiad-level bilingual multimodal scientific benchmark, featuring 8,476 problems from Olympiad-level mathematics and physics competitions, including the Chinese college entrance exam. Each problem is detailed with expert-level annotations for step-by-step reasoning. Evaluating top-tier models on OlympiadBench, we implement a comprehensive assessment methodology to accurately evaluate model responses. Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4V, attains an average score of 17.97% on OlympiadBench, with a mere 10.74% in physics, highlighting the benchmark rigor and the intricacy of physical reasoning. Our analysis orienting GPT-4V points out prevalent issues with hallucinations, knowledge omissions, and logical fallacies. We hope that our challenging benchmark can serve as a valuable resource for helping future AGI research endeavors.

Identifying while Learning for Document Event Causality Identification	Event Causality Identification (ECI) aims to detect whether there exists a causal relation between two events in a document. Existing studies adopt a kind of *identifying after learning* paradigm, where events' representations are first learned and then used for the identification. Furthermore, they mainly focus on the causality existence, but ignoring causal direction. In this paper, we take care of the causal direction and propose a new *identifying while learning* mode for the ECI task. We argue that a few causal relations can be easily identified with high confidence, and the directionality and structure of these identified causalities can be utilized to update events' representations for boosting next round of causality identification. To this end, this paper designs an *iterative learning and identifying framework*: In each iteration, we construct an event causality graph, on which events' causal structure representations are updated for boosting causal identification. Experiments on two public datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in both evaluations for causality existence identification and direction identification.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.210	Cheng Liu, Wei Xiang, Bang Wang
Understanding and Addressing the Under-Translation Problem from the Perspective of Decoding Objective	Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has made remarkable progress over the past years. However, under-translation and over-translation remain two challenging problems in state-of-the-art NMT systems. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis on the underlying cause of under-translation in NMT, providing an explanation from the perspective of decoding objective. To optimize the beam search objective, the model tends to overlook words it is less confident about, leading to the under-translation phenomenon. Correspondingly, the model's confidence in predicting the End Of Sentence (EOS) diminishes when under-translation occurs, serving as a mild penalty for under-translated candidates. Building upon this analysis, we propose employing the confidence of predicting EOS as a detector for under-translation, and strengthening the confidence-based penalty to penalize candidates with a high risk of under-translation.Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that our method can accurately detect and rectify under-translated outputs, with minor impact on other correct translations.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.209	Chenze Shao, Fandong Meng, Jiali Zeng, Jie Zhou
DataDreamer: A Tool for Synthetic Data Generation and Reproducible LLM Workflows	Large language models (LLMs) have become a dominant and important tool for NLP researchers in a wide range of tasks. Today, many researchers use LLMs in synthetic data generation, task evaluation, fine-tuning, distillation, and other model-in-the-loop research workflows. However, challenges arise when using these models that stem from their scale, their closed source nature, and the lack of standardized tooling for these new and emerging workflows. The rapid rise to prominence of these models and these unique challenges has had immediate adverse impacts on open science and on the reproducibility of work that uses them. In this ACL 2024 theme track paper, we introduce DataDreamer, an open source Python library that allows researchers to write simple code to implement powerful LLM workflows. DataDreamer also helps researchers adhere to best practices that we propose to encourage open science and reproducibility. The library and documentation are available at: https://github.com/datadreamer-dev/DataDreamer.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.208	Ajay Patel, Colin Raffel, Chris Callison-Burch
MPCoder: Multi-user Personalized Code Generator with Explicit and Implicit Style Representation Learning	Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential for assisting developers in their daily development. However, most research focuses on generating correct code, how to use LLMs to generate personalized code has seldom been investigated. To bridge this gap, we proposed MPCoder (Multi-user Personalized Code Generator) to generate personalized code for multiple users. To better learn coding style features, we utilize explicit coding style residual learning to capture the syntax code style standards and implicit style learning to capture the semantic code style conventions. We train a multi-user style adapter to better differentiate the implicit feature representations of different users through contrastive learning, ultimately enabling personalized code generation for multiple users. We further propose a novel evaluation metric for estimating similarities between codes of different coding styles. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach for this novel task.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.207	Zhenlong Dai, Chang Yao, WenKang Han, Yuanying Yuanying, Zhipeng Gao, Jingyuan Chen
MentalManip: A Dataset For Fine-grained Analysis of Mental Manipulation in Conversations	"Mental manipulation, a significant form of abuse in interpersonal conversations, presents a challenge to identify due to its context-dependent and often subtle nature. The detection of manipulative language is essential for protecting potential victims, yet the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) currently faces a scarcity of resources and research on this topic. Our study addresses this gap by introducing a new dataset, named <span style=""font-variant:small-caps"">MentalManip , which consists of 4,000 annotated fictional dialogues. This dataset enables a comprehensive analysis of mental manipulation, pinpointing both the techniques utilized for manipulation and the vulnerabilities targeted in victims. Our research further explores the effectiveness of leading-edge models in recognizing manipulative dialogue and its components through a series of experiments with various configurations. The results demonstrate that these models inadequately identify and categorize manipulative content. Attempts to improve their performance by fine-tuning with existing datasets on mental health and toxicity have not overcome these limitations. We anticipate that <span style=""font-variant:small-caps"">MentalManip will stimulate further research, leading to progress in both understanding and mitigating the impact of mental manipulation in conversations."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.206	Yuxin Wang, Ivory Yang, Saeed Hassanpour, Soroush Vosoughi
FLEUR: An Explainable Reference-Free Evaluation Metric for Image Captioning Using a Large Multimodal Model	Most existing image captioning evaluation metrics focus on assigning a single numerical score to a caption by comparing it with reference captions. However, these methods do not provide an explanation for the assigned score. Moreover, reference captions are expensive to acquire. In this paper, we propose FLEUR, an explainable reference-free metric to introduce explainability into image captioning evaluation metrics. By leveraging a large multimodal model, FLEUR can evaluate the caption against the image without the need for reference captions, and provide the explanation for the assigned score. We introduce score smoothing to align as closely as possible with human judgment and to be robust to user-defined grading criteria. FLEUR achieves high correlations with human judgment across various image captioning evaluation benchmarks and reaches state-of-the-art results on Flickr8k-CF, COMPOSITE, and Pascal-50S within the domain of reference-free evaluation metrics.

Crayon: Customized On-Device LLM via Instant Adapter Blending and Edge-Server Hybrid Inference	The customization of large language models (LLMs) for user-specified tasks gets important. However, maintaining all the customized LLMs on cloud servers incurs substantial memory and computational overheads, and uploading user data can also lead to privacy concerns. On-device LLMs can offer a promising solution by mitigating these issues. Yet, the performance of on-device LLMs is inherently constrained by the limitations of small-scaled models. To overcome these restrictions, we first propose Crayon, a novel approach for on-device LLM customization. Crayon begins by constructing a pool of diverse base adapters, and then we instantly blend them into a customized adapter without extra training. In addition, we develop a device-server hybrid inference strategy, which deftly allocates more demanding queries or non-customized tasks to a larger, more capable LLM on a server. This ensures optimal performance without sacrificing the benefits of on-device customization. We carefully craft a novel benchmark from multiple question-answer datasets, and show the efficacy of our method in the LLM customization.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.204	Jihwan Bang, Juntae Lee, Kyuhong Shim, Seunghan Yang, Simyung Chang
ARL2: Aligning Retrievers with Black-box Large Language Models via Self-guided Adaptive Relevance Labeling	Retrieval-augmented generation enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating relevant information from external knowledge sources. This enables LLMs to adapt to specific domains and mitigate hallucinations in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing retrievers are often misaligned with LLMs due to separate training processes and the inherent black-box nature of LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose ARL2, a retriever learning technique that harnesses LLMs as labelers. ARL2 leverages LLMs to annotate and score adaptive relevance evidence, enabling the retriever to learn from robust LLM supervision. Furthermore, ARL2 incorporates a self-training strategy to minimize the cost of API calls. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ARL2, achieving accuracy improvements of 5.4% on NQ and 4.6% on MMLU compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ARL2 exhibits robust transfer learning capabilities and strong zero-shot generalization abilities.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.203	LingXi Zhang, Yue Yu, Kuan Wang, Chao Zhang
StreamAtt: Direct Streaming Speech-to-Text Translation with Attention-based Audio History Selection	Streaming speech-to-text translation (StreamST) is the task of automatically translating speech while incrementally receiving an audio stream. Unlike simultaneous ST (SimulST), which deals with pre-segmented speech, StreamST faces the challenges of handling continuous and unbounded audio streams. This requires additional decisions about what to retain of the previous history, which is impractical to keep entirely due to latency and computational constraints. Despite the real-world demand for real-time ST, research on streaming translation remains limited, with existing works solely focusing on SimulST. To fill this gap, we introduce StreamAtt, the first StreamST policy, and propose StreamLAAL, the first StreamST latency metric designed to be comparable with existing metrics for SimulST. Extensive experiments across all 8 languages of MuST-C v1.0 show the effectiveness of StreamAtt compared to a naive streaming baseline and the related state-of-the-art SimulST policy, providing a first step in StreamST research.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.202	Sara Papi, Marco Gaido, Matteo Negri, Luisa Bentivogli
SBAAM! Eliminating Transcript Dependency in Automatic Subtitling	Subtitling plays a crucial role in enhancing the accessibility of audiovisual content and encompasses three primary subtasks: translating spoken dialogue, segmenting translations into concise textual units, and estimating timestamps that govern their on-screen duration. Past attempts to automate this process rely, to varying degrees, on automatic transcripts, employed diversely for the three subtasks. In response to the acknowledged limitations associated with this reliance on transcripts, recent research has shifted towards transcription-free solutions for translation and segmentation, leaving the direct generation of timestamps as uncharted territory. To fill this gap, we introduce the first direct model capable of producing automatic subtitles, entirely eliminating any dependence on intermediate transcripts also for timestamp prediction. Experimental results, backed by manual evaluation, showcase our solution's new state-of-the-art performance across multiple language pairs and diverse conditions.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.201	Marco Gaido, Sara Papi, Matteo Negri, Mauro Cettolo, Luisa Bentivogli
When Good and Reproducible Results are a Giant with Feet of Clay: The Importance of Software Quality in NLP	Despite its crucial role in research experiments, code correctness is often presumed solely based on the perceived quality of results. This assumption, however, comes with the risk of erroneous outcomes and, in turn, potentially misleading findings. To mitigate this risk, we posit that the current focus on reproducibility should go hand in hand with the emphasis on software quality. We support our arguments with a case study in which we identify and fix three bugs in widely used implementations of the state-of-the-art Conformer architecture. Through experiments on speech recognition and translation in various languages, we demonstrate that the presence of bugs does not prevent the achievement of good and reproducible results, which however can lead to incorrect conclusions that potentially misguide future research. As countermeasures, we release pangoliNN, a library dedicated to testing neural models, and propose a Code-quality Checklist, with the goal of promoting coding best practices and improving software quality within the NLP community.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.200	Sara Papi, Marco Gaido, Andrea Pilzer, Matteo Negri
Unity in Diversity: Collaborative Pre-training Across Multimodal Medical Sources	Although pre-training has become a prevalent approach for addressing various biomedical tasks, the current efficacy of pre-trained models is hindered by their reliance on a limited scope of medical sources. This limitation results in data scarcity during pre-training and restricts the range of applicable downstream tasks. In response to these challenges, we develop MedCSP, a new pre-training strategy designed to bridge the gap between multimodal medical sources. MedCSP employs modality-level aggregation to unify patient data within individual sources. Additionally, leveraging temporal information and diagnosis history, MedCSP effectively captures explicit and implicit correlations between patients across different sources. To evaluate the proposed strategy, we conduct comprehensive experiments, where the experiments are based on 6 modalities from 2 real-world medical data sources, and MedCSP is evaluated on 4 tasks against 19 baselines, marking an initial yet essential step towards cross-source modeling in the medical domain.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.199	Xiaochen Wang, Junyu Luo, Jiaqi Wang, Yuan Zhong, Xiaokun Zhang, Yaqing Wang, Parminder Bhatia, Cao Xiao, Fenglong Ma
Relying on the Unreliable: The Impact of Language Models’ Reluctance to Express Uncertainty	As natural language becomes the default interface for human-AI interaction, there is a need for LMs to appropriately communicate uncertainties in downstream applications. In this work, we investigate how LMs incorporate confidence in responses via natural language and how downstream users behave in response to LM-articulated uncertainties. We examine publicly deployed models and find that LMs are reluctant to express uncertainties when answering questions even when they produce incorrect responses. LMs can be explicitly prompted to express confidences, but tend to be overconfident, resulting in high error rates (an average of 47%) among confident responses. We test the risks of LM overconfidence by conducting human experiments and show that users rely heavily on LM generations, whether or not they are marked by certainty. Lastly, we investigate the preference-annotated datasets used in post training alignment and find that humans are biased against texts with uncertainty. Our work highlights new safety harms facing human-LM interactions and proposes design recommendations and mitigating strategies moving forward.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.198	Kaitlyn Zhou, Jena Hwang, Xiang Ren, Maarten Sap
Self-Contrast: Better Reflection Through Inconsistent Solving Perspectives	The reflection capacity of Large Language Model (LLM) has garnered extensive attention. A post-hoc prompting strategy, e.g., reflexion and self-refine, refines LLM's response based on self-evaluated or external feedback. However, recent research indicates without external feedback, LLM's intrinsic reflection is unstable. Our investigation unveils that the key bottleneck is the quality of the self-evaluated feedback. We find LLMs often exhibit overconfidence or high randomness when self-evaluate, offering stubborn or inconsistent feedback, which causes poor reflection. To remedy this, we advocate Self-Contrast: It adaptively explores diverse solving perspectives tailored to the request, contrasts the differences, and summarizes these discrepancies into a checklist which could be used to re-examine and eliminate discrepancies. Our method endows LLM with diverse perspectives to alleviate stubborn biases. Moreover, their discrepancies indicate potential errors or inherent uncertainties that LLM often overlooks. Reflecting upon these can catalyze more accurate and stable reflection. Experiments conducted on a series of reasoning and translation tasks with different LLMs serve to underscore the effectiveness and generality of our strategy.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.197	Wenqi Zhang, Yongliang Shen, Linjuan Wu, Qiuying Peng, Jun Wang, Yueting Zhuang, Weiming Lu
What Does the Bot Say? Opportunities and Risks of Large Language Models in Social Media Bot Detection	Social media bot detection has always been an arms race between advancements in machine learning bot detectors and adversarial bot strategies to evade detection. In this work, we bring the arms race to the next level by investigating the opportunities and risks of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in social bot detection. To investigate the opportunities, we design novel LLM-based bot detectors by proposing a mixture-of-heterogeneous-experts framework to divide and conquer diverse user information modalities. To illuminate the risks, we explore the possibility of LLM-guided manipulation of user textual and structured information to evade detection. Extensive experiments with three LLMs on two datasets demonstrate that instruction tuning on merely 1,000 annotated examples produces specialized LLMs that outperform state-of-the-art baselines by up to 9.1% on both datasets, while LLM-guided manipulation strategies could significantly bring down the performance of existing bot detectors by up to 29.6% and harm the calibration and reliability of bot detection systems.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.196	Shangbin Feng, Herun Wan, Ningnan Wang, Zhaoxuan Tan, Minnan Luo, Yulia Tsvetkov
Language Models Don’t Learn the Physical Manifestation of Language	We argue that language-only models don't learn the physical manifestation of language. We present an empirical investigation of visual-auditory properties of language through a series of tasks, termed H-Test.These tasks highlight a fundamental gap between human linguistic understanding and the sensory-deprived linguistic understanding of LLMs. In support of our hypothesis, 1. deliberate reasoning (Chain-of-Thought), 2. few-shot examples, or 3. stronger LLM from the same model family (LLaMA 2 13B -> LLaMA 2 70B) has no significant effect on H-Test performance. We bring in the philosophical case of Mary, who learns about the world in a sensory-deprived environment as a useful conceptual framework to understand how language-only models learn about the world (Jackson, 1986). Our experiments show that some of the strongest proprietary LLMs stay near random chance baseline accuracy of 50%, highlighting the limitations of linguistic knowledge acquired in the absence of sensory experience.

A Multi-Task Embedder For Retrieval Augmented LLMs	LLMs confront inherent limitations in terms of its knowledge, memory, and action. The retrieval augmentation stands as a vital mechanism to address these limitations, which brings in useful information from external sources to augment the LLM. However, existing retrieval methods encounter two pressing issues. On one hand, the general retrievers are not properly optimized for retrieval augmentation hence exhibit limited effectiveness; on the other hand, the task-specific retrievers excel in the targeted retrieval augmentation scenario, while lack the versatility to handle diverse scenarios. In this work, we propose LLM-Embedder for the unified support of diverse retrieval augmentation scenarios. Our method presents three technical contributions. Firstly, we introduce a new reward formulation, namely rank-aware reward. It exploits the ranking position of the desired output among N sampled outputs from the LLM, which leads to fine-grained and robust computation of reward from the LLM's feedback. Secondly, we design a novel distillation objective, called graded distillation. It incorporates both the absolute value and the relative order of the reward for more sufficient utilization of the LLM's feedback. Thirdly, we systematically optimize the multi-task learning, which effectively unifies the multiple retrieval functionalities into one model. In our experiment, LLM-Embedder substantially improves the LLM's performances in various downstream tasks, while introducing superior retrieval augmentation's effect over both general and task-specifc retrievers. Our data, code, and model have been released at https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.194	Peitian Zhang, Zheng Liu, Shitao Xiao, Zhicheng Dou, Jian-Yun Nie
Metaphor Understanding Challenge Dataset for LLMs	Metaphors in natural language are a reflection of fundamental cognitive processes such as analogical reasoning and categorisation, and are deeply rooted in everyday communication. Metaphor understanding is therefore an essential task for large language models (LLMs). We release the Metaphor Understanding Challenge Dataset (MUNCH), designed to evaluate the metaphor understanding capabilities of LLMs. The dataset provides over 10k paraphrases for sentences containing metaphor use, as well as 1.5k instances containing inapt paraphrases. The inapt paraphrases were carefully selected to serve as control to determine whether the model indeed performs full metaphor interpretation or rather resorts to lexical similarity. All apt and inapt paraphrases were manually annotated. The metaphorical sentences cover natural metaphor uses across 4 genres (academic, news, fiction, and conversation), and they exhibit different levels of novelty. Experiments with LLaMA and GPT-3.5 demonstrate that MUNCH presents a challenging task for LLMs. The dataset is freely accessible at https://github.com/xiaoyuisrain/metaphor-understanding-challenge.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.193	Xiaoyu Tong, Rochelle Choenni, Martha Lewis, Ekaterina Shutova
Democratizing LLMs for Low-Resource Languages by Leveraging their English Dominant Abilities with Linguistically-Diverse Prompts	Large language models (LLMs) are known to effectively perform tasks by simply observing few exemplars. However, in low-resource languages, obtaining such hand-picked exemplars can still be challenging, where unsupervised techniques may be necessary. Moreover, competent generative capabilities of LLMs are observed only in high-resource languages, while their performances among under-represented languages fall behind due to pre-training data imbalance. To elicit LLMs' ability onto low-resource languages without any supervised data, we propose to assemble synthetic exemplars from a diverse set of high-resource languages to prompt the LLMs to translate from any language into English. These prompts are then used to create intra-lingual exemplars to perform tasks in the target languages. Our unsupervised prompting method performs on par with supervised few-shot learning in LLMs of different sizes for translations between English and 13 Indic and 21 African low-resource languages. We also show that fine-tuning a 7B model on data generated from our method helps it perform competitively with a 175B model. In non-English translation tasks, our method even outperforms supervised prompting by up to 3 chrF++ in many low-resource languages. When evaluated on zero-shot multilingual summarization, our method surpasses other English-pivoting baselines by up to 4 ROUGE-L and is also favored by GPT-4.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.192	Xuan-Phi Nguyen, Mahani Aljunied, Shafiq Joty, Lidong Bing
Llama2Vec: Unsupervised Adaptation of Large Language Models for Dense Retrieval	Dense retrieval calls for discriminative embeddings to represent the semantic relationship between query and document. It may benefit from the using of large language models (LLMs), given LLMs' strong capability on semantic understanding. However, the LLMs are learned by auto-regression, whose working mechanism is completely different from representing whole text as one discriminative embedding. Thus, it is imperative to study how to adapt LLMs properly so that they can be effectively initialized as the backbone encoder for dense retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called Llama2Vec, which performs unsupervised adaptation of LLM for its dense retrieval application. Llama2Vec consists of two pretext tasks: EBAE (Embedding-Based Auto-Encoding) and EBAR (Embedding-Based Auto-Regression), where the LLM is prompted to reconstruct the input sentence and predict the next sentence based on its text embeddings. Llama2Vec is simple, lightweight, but highly effective. It is used to adapt LLaMA-2-7B on the Wikipedia corpus. With a moderate steps of adaptation, it substantially improves the model's fine-tuned performances on a variety of dense retrieval benchmarks. Notably, it results in the new state-of-the-art performances on popular benchmarks, such as passage and document retrieval on MSMARCO, and zero-shot retrieval on BEIR. The model and source code will be made publicly available to facilitate the future research.

Progressively Modality Freezing for Multi-Modal Entity Alignment	Multi-Modal Entity Alignment aims to discover identical entities across heterogeneous knowledge graphs. While recent studies have delved into fusion paradigms to represent entities holistically, the elimination of features irrelevant to alignment and modal inconsistencies is overlooked, which are caused by inherent differences in multi-modal features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel strategy of progressive modality freezing, called PMF, that focuses on alignment-relevant features and enhances multi-modal feature fusion. Notably, our approach introduces a pioneering cross-modal association loss to foster modal consistency.Empirical evaluations across nine datasets confirm PMF's superiority, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and the rationale for freezing modalities. Our code is available at https://github.com/ninibymilk/PMF-MMEA.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.190	Yani Huang, Xuefeng Zhang, Richong Zhang, Junfan Chen, Jaein Kim
Prompt Expansion for Adaptive Text-to-Image Generation	Text-to-image generation models are powerful but difficult to use. Users craft specific prompts to get better images, though the images can be repetitive. This paper proposes the Prompt Expansion framework that helps users generate high-quality, diverse images with less effort. The Prompt Expansion model takes a text query as input and outputs a set of expanded text prompts that are optimized such that when passed to a text-to-image model, they generate a wider variety of appealing images. We conduct a human evaluation study that shows that images generated through Prompt Expansion are more aesthetically pleasing and diverse than those generated by baseline methods. Overall, this paper presents a novel and effective approach to improving the text-to-image generation experience.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.189	Siddhartha Datta, Alexander Ku, Deepak Ramachandran, Peter Anderson
Collaboration or Corporate Capture? Quantifying NLP’s Reliance on Industry Artifacts and Contributions	Impressive performance of pre-trained models has garnered public attention and made news headlines in recent years. Almost always, these models are produced by or in collaboration with industry. Using them is critical for competing on natural language processing (NLP) benchmarks and correspondingly to stay relevant in NLP research. We surveyed 100 papers published at EMNLP 2022 to determine the degree to which researchers rely on industry models, other artifacts, and contributions to publish in prestigious NLP venues and found that the ratio of their citation is at least three times greater than what would be expected. Our work serves as a scaffold to enable future researchers to more accurately address whether: 1) Collaboration with industry is still collaboration in the absence of an alternative or 2) if NLP inquiry has been captured by the motivations and research direction of private corporations.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.188	Will Aitken, Mohamed Abdalla, Karen Rudie, Catherine Stinson
Timeline-based Sentence Decomposition with In Context Learning for Temporal Fact Extraction	Facts extraction is pivotal for constructing knowledge graphs. Recently, the increasing demand for temporal facts in downstream tasks has led to the emergence of the task of temporal fact extraction. In this paper, we specifically address the extraction of temporal facts from natural language text. Previous studies fail to handle the challenge of establishing time-to-fact correspondences in complex sentences. To overcome this hurdle, we propose a timeline-based sentence decomposition strategy using large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning, ensuring a fine-grained understanding of the timeline associated with various facts. In addition, we evaluate the performance of LLMs for direct temporal fact extraction and get unsatisfactory results. To this end, we introduce TSDRE, a method that incorporates the decomposition capabilities of LLMs into the traditional fine-tuning of smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs). To support the evaluation, we construct ComplexTRED, a complex temporal fact extraction dataset.

BIPED: Pedagogically Informed Tutoring System for ESL Education	Large Language Models (LLMs) have a great potential to serve as readily available and cost-efficient Conversational Intelligent Tutoring Systems (CITS) for teaching L2 learners of English. Existing CITS, however, are designed to teach only simple concepts or lack the pedagogical depth necessary to address diverse learning strategies. To develop a more pedagogically informed CITS capable of teaching complex concepts, we construct a BIlingual PEDagogically-informed Tutoring Dataset (BIPED) of one-on-one, human-to-human English tutoring interactions. Through post-hoc analysis of the tutoring interactions, we come up with a lexicon of dialogue acts (34 tutor acts and 9 student acts), which we use to further annotate the collected dataset. Based on a two-step framework of first predicting the appropriate tutor act then generating the corresponding response, we implemented two CITS models using GPT-4 and SOLAR-KO, respectively. We experimentally demonstrate that the implemented models not only replicate the style of human teachers but also employ diverse and contextually appropriate pedagogical strategies.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.186	Soonwoo Kwon, Sojung Kim, Minju Park, Seunghyun Lee, Kyuseok Kim
Beyond Memorization: The Challenge of Random Memory Access in Language Models	Recent developments in Language Models (LMs) have shown their effectiveness in NLP tasks, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks.However, the mechanisms underlying knowledge storage and memory access within their parameters remain elusive. In this paper, we investigate whether a generative LM (e.g., GPT-2) is able to access its memory sequentially or randomly. Through carefully-designed synthetic tasks, covering the scenarios of full recitation, selective recitation and grounded question answering, we reveal that LMs manage to sequentially access their memory while encountering challenges in randomly accessing memorized content. We find that techniques including recitation and permutation improve the random memory access capability of LMs. Furthermore, by applying this intervention to realistic scenarios of open-domain question answering, we validate that enhancing random access by recitation leads to notable improvements in question answering. The code to reproduce our experiments can be found at https://github.com/sail-sg/lm-random-memory-access.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.185	Tongyao Zhu, Qian Liu, Liang Pang, Zhengbao Jiang, Min-Yen Kan, Min Lin
OceanGPT: A Large Language Model for Ocean Science Tasks	Ocean science, which delves into the oceans that are reservoirs of life and biodiversity, is of great significance given that oceans cover over 70% of our planet's surface. Recently, advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the paradigm in science. Despite the success in other domains, current LLMs often fall short in catering to the needs of domain experts like oceanographers, and the potential of LLMs for ocean science is under-explored. The intrinsic reason may be the immense and intricate nature of ocean data as well as the necessity for higher granularity and richness in knowledge. To alleviate these issues, we introduce OceanGPT, the first-ever LLM in the ocean domain, which is expert in various ocean science tasks. We propose DoInstruct, a novel framework to automatically obtain a large volume of ocean domain instruction data, which generates instructions based on multi-agent collaboration. Additionally, we construct the first oceanography benchmark, OceanBench, to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in the ocean domain. Though comprehensive experiments, OceanGPT not only shows a higher level of knowledge expertise for oceans science tasks but also gains preliminary embodied intelligence capabilities in ocean technology.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.184	Zhen Bi, Ningyu Zhang, Yida Xue, Yixin Ou, Daxiong Ji, Guozhou Zheng, Huajun Chen
T2S-GPT: Dynamic Vector Quantization for Autoregressive Sign Language Production from Text	In this work, we propose a two-stage sign language production (SLP) paradigm that first encodes sign language sequences into discrete codes and then autoregressively generates sign language from text based on the learned codebook. However, existing vector quantization (VQ) methods are fixed-length encodings, overlooking the uneven information density in sign language, which leads to under-encoding of important regions and over-encoding of unimportant regions. To address this issue, we propose a novel dynamic vector quantization (DVA-VAE) model that can dynamically adjust the encoding length based on the information density in sign language to achieve accurate and compact encoding. Then, a GPT-like model learns to generate code sequences and their corresponding durations from spoken language text. Extensive experiments conducted on the PHOENIX14T dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. To promote sign language research, we propose a new large German sign language dataset, PHOENIX-News, which contains 486 hours of sign language videos, audio, and transcription texts. Experimental analysis on PHOENIX-News shows that the performance of our model can be further improved by increasing the size of the training data.

Attribute First, then Generate: Locally-attributable Grounded Text Generation	"Recent efforts to address hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) have focused on attributed text generation, which supplements generated texts with citations of supporting sources for post-generation fact-checking and corrections. Yet, these citations often point to entire documents or paragraphs, burdening users with extensive verification work. In this paper, we introduce a locally-attributable text generation approach, prioritizing concise attributions. Our method, named ""Attribute First, then Generate"", breaks down the conventional end-to-end generation process into three intuitive steps: content selection, sentence planning, and sequential sentence generation. By initially identifying relevant source segments (""select first"") and then conditioning the generation process on them (""then generate""), we ensure these segments also act as the output's fine-grained attributions (""select"" becomes ""attribute""). Tested on Multi-document Summarization and Long-form Question-answering, our method not only yields more concise citations than the baselines but also maintains - and in some cases enhances - both generation quality and attribution accuracy. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the time required for fact verification by human assessors."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.182	Aviv Slobodkin, Eran Hirsch, Arie Cattan, Tal Schuster, Ido Dagan
GrowOVER: How Can LLMs Adapt to Growing Real-World Knowledge?	In the real world, knowledge is constantly evolving, which can render existing knowledge-based datasets outdated. This unreliability highlights the critical need for continuous updates to ensure both accuracy and relevance in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this, we propose GrowOVER-QA and GrowOVER-Dialogue, dynamic open-domain QA and dialogue benchmarks that undergo a continuous cycle of updates, keeping pace with the rapid evolution of knowledge. Our research indicates that retrieval-augmented language models (RaLMs) struggle with knowledge that has not been trained on or recently updated. Consequently, we introduce a novel retrieval-interactive language model framework, where the language model evaluates and reflects on its answers for further re-retrieval. Our exhaustive experiments demonstrate that our training-free framework significantly improves upon existing methods, performing comparably to or even surpassing continuously trained language models.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.181	Dayoon Ko, Jinyoung Kim, Hahyeon Choi, Gunhee Kim
Empowering Character-level Text Infilling by Eliminating Sub-Tokens	In infilling tasks, sub-tokens, representing instances where a complete token is segmented into two parts, often emerge at the boundaries of prefixes, middles, and suffixes. Traditional methods focused on training models at the token level, leading to sub-optimal performance in character-level infilling tasks during the inference stage. Alternately, some approaches considered character-level infilling, but they relied on predicting sub-tokens in inference, yet this strategy diminished ability in character-level infilling tasks due to the large perplexity of the model on sub-tokens. In this paper, we introduce FIM-SE, which stands for Fill-In-the-Middle with both Starting and Ending character constraints. The proposed method addresses character-level infilling tasks by utilizing a line-level format to avoid predicting any sub-token in inference. In addition, we incorporate two special tokens to signify the rest of the incomplete lines, thereby enhancing generation guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses previous methods, offering a significant advantage.

Landmark Embedding: A Chunking-Free Embedding Method For Retrieval Augmented Long-Context Large Language Models	Retrieval augmentation is a promising approach to handle long-context language modeling. However, the existing retrieval methods usually work with the chunked context, which is prone to inferior quality of semantic representation and incomplete retrieval of useful information. In this work, we propose a new method for the retrieval augmentation of long-context language modeling, called Landmark Embedding. Our method is characterized by threefold technical contributions. Firstly, we introduce a chunking-free architecture, which keeps the long context coherent such that high-quality embeddings can be generated for the fine-grained units within the context. Secondly, we present a position-aware objective function, which prioritizes the ultimate boundary for a consecutive span of information. By learning to discriminate such a special position, the useful information can be comprehensively retrieved for the query. Thirdly, we design a novel multi-stage learning algorithm, which makes the best use of readily available data and synthetic data for cost-effective training of the landmark embedding. In our experimental study, landmark embedding is able to substantially improve the performance for both LLaMA-2 and ChatGPT in a variety of long-context tasks; meanwhile, it also outperforms the existing retrieval methods with a notable advantage. Our model and source code will be made publicly available.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.180	Kun Luo, Zheng Liu, Shitao Xiao, Tong Zhou, Yubo Chen, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu
Unified Hallucination Detection for Multimodal Large Language Models	Despite significant strides in multimodal tasks, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are plagued by the critical issue of hallucination. The reliable detection of such hallucinations in MLLMs has, therefore, become a vital aspect of model evaluation and the safeguarding of practical application deployment. Prior research in this domain has been constrained by a narrow focus on singular tasks, an inadequate range of hallucination categories addressed, and a lack of detailed granularity. In response to these challenges, our work expands the investigative horizons of hallucination detection. We present a novel meta-evaluation benchmark, MHaluBench, meticulously crafted to facilitate the evaluation of advancements in hallucination detection methods. Additionally, we unveil a novel unified multimodal hallucination detection framework, UNIHD, which leverages a suite of auxiliary tools to validate the occurrence of hallucinations robustly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of UNIHD through meticulous evaluation and comprehensive analysis. We also provide strategic insights on the application of specific tools for addressing various categories of hallucinations.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.178	Xiang Chen, Chenxi Wang, Yida Xue, Ningyu Zhang, Xiaoyan Yang, Qiang Li, Yue Shen, Lei Liang, Jinjie Gu, Huajun Chen
Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard: Evaluating Large Language Models in Korean with Ko-H5 Benchmark	This paper introduces the Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard and the Ko-H5 Benchmark as vital tools for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in Korean. Incorporating private test sets while mirroring the English Open LLM Leaderboard, we establish a robust evaluation framework that has been well integrated in the Korean LLM community. We perform data leakage analysis that shows the benefit of private test sets along with a correlation study within the Ko-H5 benchmark and temporal analyses of the Ko-H5 score. Moreover, we present empirical support for the need to expand beyond set benchmarks. We hope the Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard sets precedent for expanding LLM evaluation to foster more linguistic diversity.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.177	Chanjun Park, Hyeonwoo Kim, Dahyun Kim, SeongHwan Cho, Sanghoon Kim, Sukyung Lee, Yungi Kim, Hwalsuk Lee
Black-Box Prompt Optimization: Aligning Large Language Models without Model Training	Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive success in various applications. However, these models are often not well aligned with human intents, which calls for additional treatments on them; that is, the alignment problem. To make LLMs better follow user instructions, existing alignment methods primarily focus on further training them. However, the extra training of LLMs is usually expensive in terms of GPU computing; even worse, some LLMs are not accessible for user-demanded training, such as GPTs. In this work, we take a different perspective—Black-Box Prompt Optimization (BPO)—to perform alignments. The idea is to optimize user prompts to suit LLMs' input understanding, so as to best realize users' intents without updating LLMs' parameters. BPO leverages human preferences to optimize prompts, thus making it superior to LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) as a prompt engineer. Moreover, BPO is model-agnostic, and the empirical results demonstrate that the BPO-aligned ChatGPT yields a 22% increase in the win rate against its original version and 10% for GPT-4. Notably, the BPO-aligned LLMs can outperform the same models aligned by PPO and DPO, and it also brings additional performance gains when combining BPO with PPO or DPO.

UniBridge: A Unified Approach to Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning for Low-Resource Languages	In this paper, we introduce UniBridge (Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning with Optimized Embeddings and Vocabulary), a comprehensive approach developed to improve the effectiveness of Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning, particularly in languages with limited resources. Our approach tackles two essential elements of a language model: the initialization of embeddings and the optimal vocabulary size. Specifically, we propose a novel embedding initialization method that leverages both lexical and semantic alignment for a language. In addition, we present a method for systematically searching for the optimal vocabulary size, ensuring a balance between model complexity and linguistic coverage. Our experiments across multilingual datasets show that our approach greatly improves the F1-Score in several languages. UniBridge is a robust and adaptable solution for cross-lingual systems in various languages, highlighting the significance of initializing embeddings and choosing the right vocabulary size in cross-lingual environments.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.174	Trinh Pham, Khoi Le, Anh Tuan Luu
VISTA: Visualized Text Embedding For Universal Multi-Modal Retrieval	Multi-modal retrieval becomes increasingly popular in practice. However, the existing retrievers are mostly text-oriented, which lack the capability to process visual information. Despite the presence of vision-language models like CLIP, the current methods are severely limited in representing the text-only and image-only data. In this work, we present a new embedding model VISTA for universal multi-modal retrieval. Our work brings forth threefold technical contributions. Firstly, we introduce a flexible architecture which extends a powerful text encoder with the image understanding capability by introducing visual token embeddings. Secondly, we develop two data generation strategies, which bring high-quality composed image-text to facilitate the training of the embedding model. Thirdly, we introduce a multi-stage training algorithm, which first aligns the visual token embedding with the text encoder using massive weakly labeled data, and then develops multi-modal representation capability using the generated composed image-text data. In our experiments, VISTA achieves superior performances across a variety of multi-modal retrieval tasks in both zero-shot and supervised settings.

Dr.Academy: A Benchmark for Evaluating Questioning Capability in Education for Large Language Models	Teachers are important to imparting knowledge and guiding learners, and the role of large language models (LLMs) as potential educators is emerging as an important area of study. Recognizing LLMs' capability to generate educational content can lead to advances in automated and personalized learning. While LLMs have been tested for their comprehension and problem-solving skills, their capability in teaching remains largely unexplored.In teaching, questioning is a key skill that guides students to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize core concepts and principles.Therefore, our research introduces a benchmark to evaluate the questioning capability in education as a teacher of LLMs through evaluating their generated educational questions, utilizing Anderson and Krathwohl's taxonomy across general, monodisciplinary, and interdisciplinary domains. We shift the focus from LLMs as learners to LLMs as educators, assessing their teaching capability through guiding them to generate questions. We apply four metrics, including relevance, coverage, representativeness, and consistency, to evaluate the educational quality of LLMs' outputs. Our results indicate that GPT-4 demonstrates significant potential in teaching general, humanities, and science courses; Claude2 appears more apt as an interdisciplinary teacher. Furthermore, the automatic scores align with human perspectives.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.173	Yuyan Chen, Songzhou Yan, Panjun Liu, Yanghua Xiao
Detoxifying Large Language Models via Knowledge Editing	This paper investigates using knowledge editing techniques to detoxify Large Language Models (LLMs). We construct a benchmark, SafeEdit, which covers nine unsafe categories with various powerful attack prompts and equips comprehensive metrics for systematic evaluation. We conduct experiments with several knowledge editing approaches, indicating that knowledge editing has the potential to efficiently detoxify LLMs with limited impact on general performance. Then, we propose a simple yet effective baseline, dubbed Detoxifying with Intraoperative Neural Monitoring (DINM), to diminish the toxicity of LLMs within a few tuning steps via only one instance. We further provide an in-depth analysis of the internal mechanism for various detoxifying approaches, demonstrating that previous methods like SFT and DPO may merely suppress the activations of toxic parameters, while DINM mitigates the toxicity of the toxic parameters to a certain extent, making permanent adjustments. We hope that these insights could shed light on future work of developing detoxifying approaches and the underlying knowledge mechanisms of LLMs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.171	Mengru Wang, Ningyu Zhang, Ziwen Xu, Zekun Xi, Shumin Deng, Yunzhi Yao, Qishen Zhang, Linyi Yang, Jindong Wang, Huajun Chen
An Iterative Associative Memory Model for Empathetic Response Generation	Empathetic response generation aims to comprehend the cognitive and emotional states in dialogue utterances and generate proper responses. Psychological theories posit that comprehending emotional and cognitive states necessitates iteratively capturing and understanding associated words across dialogue utterances. However, existing approaches regard dialogue utterances as either a long sequence or independent utterances for comprehension, which are prone to overlook the associated words between them. To address this issue, we propose an Iterative Associative Memory Model (IAMM) for empathetic response generation. Specifically, we employ a novel second-order interaction attention mechanism to iteratively capture vital associated words between dialogue utterances and situations, dialogue history, and a memory module (for storing associated words), thereby accurately and nuancedly comprehending the utterances.We conduct experiments on the Empathetic-Dialogue dataset. Both automatic and human evaluations validate the efficacy of the model. Variant experiments on LLMs also demonstrate that attending to associated words improves empathetic comprehension and expression.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.170	Zhou Yang, Zhaochun Ren, Wang Yufeng, Haizhou Sun, Chao Chen, Xiaofei Zhu, Xiangwen Liao
LongBench: A Bilingual, Multitask Benchmark for Long Context Understanding	Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance for many language tasks, most of them can only handle texts a few thousand tokens long, limiting their applications on longer sequence inputs, such as books, reports, and codebases. Recent works have proposed methods to improve LLMs' long context capabilities by extending context windows and more sophisticated memory mechanisms. However, comprehensive benchmarks tailored for evaluating long context understanding are lacking. In this paper, we introduce LongBench, the first bilingual, multi-task benchmark for long context understanding, enabling a more rigorous evaluation of long context understanding. LongBench comprises 21 datasets across 6 task categories in both English and Chinese, with an average length of 6,711 words (English) and 13,386 characters (Chinese). These tasks cover key long-text application areas including single-doc QA, multi-doc QA, summarization, few-shot learning, synthetic tasks, and code completion. All datasets in LongBench are standardized into a unified format, allowing for effortless automatic evaluation of LLMs. Upon comprehensive evaluation of 8 LLMs on LongBench, we find that: (1) Commercial model (GPT-3.5-Turbo-16k) outperforms other open-sourced models, but still struggles on longer contexts. (2) Scaled position embedding and fine-tuning on longer sequences lead to substantial improvement on long context understanding. (3) Context compression technique such as retrieval brings improvement for model with weak ability on long contexts, but the performance still lags behind models that have strong long context understanding capability.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.172	Yushi Bai, Xin Lv, Jiajie Zhang, Hongchang Lyu, Jiankai Tang, Zhidian Huang, Zhengxiao Du, Xiao Liu, Aohan Zeng, Lei Hou, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang, Juanzi Li
Can LLMs Learn from Previous Mistakes? Investigating LLMs’ Errors to Boost for Reasoning	"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated striking reasoning capability. Recent works have shown the benefits to LLMs from fine-tuning golden-standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales or using them as correct examples in few-shot prompting. While humans can indeed imitate correct examples, learning from our mistakes is another vital aspect of human cognition. Hence, a question naturally arises: can LLMs learn and benefit from their mistakes, especially for their reasoning?This study investigates this problem from both the prompting and model-tuning perspectives. We begin by introducing CoTErrorSet, a new benchmark with 609,432 questions, each designed with both correct and error references, and demonstrating the types and reasons for making such mistakes. To explore the effectiveness of those mistakes, we design two methods: (1) Self-rethinking prompting guides LLMs to rethink whether they have made similar previous mistakes; and (2) Mistake tuning involves finetuning models in both correct and incorrect reasoning domains, rather than only tuning models to learn ground truth in traditional methodology. We conduct a series of experiments to prove LLMs can obtain benefits from mistakes in both directions. Our two methods offer potentially cost-effective strategies by leveraging errors to enhance reasoning capabilities, which costs significantly less than creating meticulously hand-crafted golden references. We ultimately make a thorough analysis of the reasons behind LLMs' errors, which provides directions that future research needs to overcome. CoTErrorSet will be published soon on <a href=""https://github.com/YookiTong/Learn-from-Mistakes-CotErrorSet"" class=""acl-markup-url"">https://github.com/YookiTong/Learn-from-Mistakes-CotErrorSet ."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.169	Yongqi Tong, Dawei Li, Sizhe Wang, Yujia Wang, Fei Teng, Jingbo Shang
MELoRA: Mini-Ensemble Low-Rank Adapters for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning	Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a popular method for tailoring pre-trained large language models (LLMs), especially as the models' scale and the diversity of tasks increase. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is based on the idea that the adaptation process is intrinsically low-dimensional, i.e., significant model changes can be represented with relatively few parameters. However, decreasing the rank encounters challenges with generalization errors for specific tasks when compared to full-parameter fine-tuning. We present MELoRA, a mini-ensemble low-rank adapters that uses fewer trainable parameters while maintaining a higher rank, thereby offering improved performance potential.The core idea is to freeze original pretrained weights and train a group of mini LoRAs with only a small number of parameters. This can capture a significant degree of diversity among mini LoRAs, thus promoting better generalization ability. We conduct a theoretical analysis and empirical studies on various NLP tasks. Our experimental results show that, compared to LoRA, MELoRA achieves better performance with 8 times fewer trainable parameters on natural language understanding tasks and 36 times fewer trainable parameters on instruction following tasks, which demonstrates the effectiveness of MELoRA.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.168	Pengjie Ren, Chengshun Shi, Shiguang Wu, Mengqi Zhang, Zhaochun Ren, Maarten Rijke, Zhumin Chen, Jiahuan Pei
Virtual Compiler Is All You Need For Assembly Code Search	"Assembly code search is vital for reducing the burden on reverse engineers, allowing them to quickly identify specific functions using natural language within vast binary programs.Despite its significance, this critical task is impeded by the complexities involved in building high-quality datasets. This paper explores training a Large Language Model (LLM) to emulate a general compiler. By leveraging Ubuntu packages to compile a dataset of 20 billion tokens, we further continue pre-train CodeLlama as a Virtual Compiler (ViC), capable of compiling any source code to assembly code. This approach allows for ""virtual"" compilation across a wide range of programming languages without the need for a real compiler, preserving semantic equivalency and expanding the possibilities for assembly code dataset construction. Furthermore, we use ViC to construct a sufficiently large dataset for assembly code search. Employing this extensive dataset, we achieve a substantial improvement in assembly code search performance, with our model surpassing the leading baseline by 26%."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.167	Zeyu Gao, Hao Wang, Yuanda Wang, Chao Zhang
ChronosLex: Time-aware Incremental Training for Temporal Generalization of Legal Classification Tasks	This study investigates the challenges posed by the dynamic nature of legal multi-label text classification tasks, where legal concepts evolve over time. Existing models often overlook the temporal dimension in their training process, leading to suboptimal performance of those models over time, as they treat training data as a single homogeneous block. To address this, we introduce ChronosLex, an incremental training paradigm that trains models on chronological splits, preserving the temporal order of the data. However, this incremental approach raises concerns about overfitting to recent data, prompting an assessment of mitigation strategies using continual learning and temporal invariant methods. Our experimental results over six legal multi-label text classification datasets reveal that continual learning methods prove effective in preventing overfitting thereby enhancing temporal generalizability, while temporal invariant methods struggle to capture these dynamics of temporal shifts.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.166	Santosh T.y.s.s, Tuan-Quang Vuong, Matthias Grabmair
AutoAct: Automatic Agent Learning from Scratch for QA via Self-Planning	Language agents have achieved considerable performance on various complex question-answering tasks by planning with external tools. Despite the incessant exploration in this field, existing language agent systems still struggle with costly, non-reproducible data reliance and face the challenge of compelling a single model for multiple functions. To this end, we introduce AutoAct, an automatic agent learning framework for QA that does not rely on large-scale annotated data and synthetic planning trajectories from closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4). Given limited data with a tool library, AutoAct first automatically synthesizes planning trajectories without any assistance from humans or strong closed-source models. Then, AutoAct leverages a division-of-labor strategy to automatically differentiate based on the target task information and synthesized trajectories, producing a sub-agent group to complete the task. We conduct comprehensive experiments with different LLMs, which demonstrates that AutoAct yields better or parallel performance compared to various strong baselines. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the division-of-labor strategy, with the trajectory quality generated by AutoAct generally outperforming that of others.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.165	Shuofei Qiao, Ningyu Zhang, Runnan Fang, Yujie Luo, Wangchunshu Zhou, Yuchen Jiang, Chengfei Lv, Huajun Chen
Synergetic Event Understanding: A Collaborative Approach to Cross-Document Event Coreference Resolution with Large Language Models	Cross-document event coreference resolution (CDECR) involves clustering event mentions across multiple documents that refer to the same real-world events. Existing approaches utilize fine-tuning of small language models (SLMs) like BERT to address the compatibility among the contexts of event mentions. However, due to the complexity and diversity of contexts, these models are prone to learning simple co-occurrences. Recently, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have demonstrated impressive contextual understanding, yet they encounter challenges in adapting to specific information extraction (IE) tasks. In this paper, we propose a collaborative approach for CDECR, leveraging the capabilities of both a universally capable LLM and a task-specific SLM. The collaborative strategy begins with the LLM accurately and comprehensively summarizing events through prompting. Then, the SLM refines its learning of event representations based on these insights during fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses the performance of both the large and small language models individually, forming a complementary advantage. Across various datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness in diverse scenarios.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.164	Qingkai Min, Qipeng Guo, Xiangkun Hu, Songfang Huang, Zheng Zhang, Yue Zhang
GSM-Plus: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating the Robustness of LLMs as Mathematical Problem Solvers	Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across various mathematical reasoning benchmarks. However, there are increasing debates regarding whether these models truly understand and apply mathematical knowledge or merely rely on shortcuts for mathematical reasoning. One essential and frequently occurring evidence is that when the math questions are slightly changed, LLMs can behave incorrectly. This motivates us to evaluate the robustness of LLMs' math reasoning capability by testing a wide range of question variations. We introduce the adversarial grade school math (GSM-Plus) dataset, an extension of GSM8K augmented with various mathematical perturbations. Our experiments on 25 LLMs and 4 prompting techniques show that while LLMs exhibit different levels of math reasoning abilities, their performances are far from robust. In particular, even for problems that have been solved in GSM8K, LLMs can make mistakes when new statements are added or the question targets are altered. We also explore whether more robust performance can be achieved by composing existing prompting methods, in which we try an iterative method that generates and verifies each intermediate thought based on its reasoning goal and calculation result.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.163	Qintong Li, Leyang Cui, Xueliang Zhao, Lingpeng Kong, Wei Bi
Hypergraph based Understanding for Document Semantic Entity Recognition	Semantic entity recognition is an important task in the field of visually-rich document understanding. It distinguishes the semantic types of text by analyzing the position relationship between text nodes and the relation between text content. The existing document understanding models mainly focus on entity categories while ignoring the extraction of entity boundaries. We build a novel hypergraph attention document semantic entity recognition framework, HGA, which uses hypergraph attention to focus on entity boundaries and entity categories at the same time. It can conduct a more detailed analysis of the document text representation analyzed by the upstream model and achieves a better performance of semantic information. We apply this method on the basis of GraphLayoutLM to construct a new semantic entity recognition model HGALayoutLM. Our experiment results on FUNSD, CORD, XFUND and SROIE show that our method can effectively improve the performance of semantic entity recognition tasks based on the original model. The results of HGALayoutLM on FUNSD and XFUND reach the new state-of-the-art results.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.162	Qiwei Li, Zuchao Li, Ping Wang, Haojun Ai, Hai Zhao
Training Language Models to Generate Text with Citations via Fine-grained Rewards	While recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven useful in answering user queries, they are prone to hallucination, and their responses often lack credibility due to missing references to reliable sources. An intuitive solution to these issues would be to include in-text citations referring to external documents as evidence. While previous works have directly prompted LLMs to generate in-text citations, their performances are far from satisfactory, especially when it comes to smaller LLMs. In this work, we propose an effective training framework using fine-grained rewards to teach LLMs to generate highly supportive and relevant citations, while ensuring the correctness of their responses. We also conduct a systematic analysis of applying these fine-grained rewards to common LLM training strategies, demonstrating its advantage over conventional practices. We conduct extensive experiments on Question Answering (QA) datasets taken from the ALCE benchmark and validate the model's generalizability using EXPERTQA. On LLaMA-2-7B, the incorporation of fine-grained rewards achieves the best performance among the baselines, even surpassing that of GPT-3.5-turbo.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.161	Chengyu Huang, Zeqiu Wu, Yushi Hu, Wenya Wang
Interpreting Conversational Dense Retrieval by Rewriting-Enhanced Inversion of Session Embedding	Conversational dense retrieval has shown to be effective in conversational search. However, a major limitation of conversational dense retrieval is their lack of interpretability, hindering intuitive understanding of model behaviors for targeted improvements. This paper presents CONVINV, a simple yet effective approach to shed light on interpretable conversational dense retrieval models. CONVINV transforms opaque conversational session embeddings into explicitly interpretable text while faithfully maintaining their original retrieval performance as much as possible. Such transformation is achieved by training a recently proposed Vec2Text model based on the ad-hoc query encoder, leveraging the fact that the session and query embeddings share the same space in existing conversational dense retrieval.To further enhance interpretability, we propose to incorporate external interpretable query rewrites into the transformation process. Extensive evaluations on three conversational search benchmarks demonstrate that CONVINV can yield more interpretable text and faithfully preserve original retrieval performance than baselines.

Through the MUD: A Multi-Defendant Charge Prediction Benchmark with Linked Crime Elements	"The current charge prediction datasets mostly focus on single-defendant criminal cases.However, real-world criminal cases usually involve multiple defendants whose criminal facts are intertwined. In an early attempt to fill this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that encompasses legal cases involving multiple defendants, where each defendant is labeled with a charge and four types of crime elements, i.e., Object Element, Objective Element, Subject Element, and Subjective Element. Based on the dataset, we further develop an interpretable model called EJudge that incorporates crime elements and legal rules to infer charges. We observe that predicting crime charges while providing corresponding rationales benefits the interpretable AI system. Extensive experiments show that EJudge significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, which verify the importance of crime elements and legal rules in multi-defendant charge prediction.

Improving Event Definition Following For Zero-Shot Event Detection	Existing approaches on zero-shot event detection usually train models on datasets annotated with known event types, and prompt them with unseen event definitions. These approaches yield sporadic successes, yet generally fall short of expectations.In this work, we aim to improve zero-shot event detection by training models to better follow event definitions. We hypothesize that a diverse set of event types and definitions are the key for models to learn to follow event definitions while existing event extraction datasets focus on annotating many high-quality examples for a few event types. To verify our hypothesis, we construct an automatically generated Diverse Event Definition (DivED) dataset and conduct comparative studies. Our experiments reveal that a large number of event types (200) and diverse event definitions can significantly boost event extraction performance; on the other hand, the performance does not scale with over ten examples per event type.Beyond scaling, we incorporate event ontology information and hard-negative samples during training, further boosting the performance. Based on these findings, we fine-tuned a LLaMA-2-7B model on our DivED dataset, yielding performance that surpasses SOTA large language models like GPT-3.5 across three open benchmarks on zero-shot event detection.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.157	Zefan Cai, Po-Nien Kung, Ashima Suvarna, Mingyu Ma, Hritik Bansal, Baobao Chang, P.

Stumbling Blocks: Stress Testing the Robustness of Machine-Generated Text Detectors Under Attacks	The widespread use of large language models (LLMs) is increasing the demand for methods that detect machine-generated text to prevent misuse. The goal of our study is to stress test the detectors' robustness to malicious attacks under realistic scenarios. We comprehensively study the robustness of popular machine-generated text detectors under attacks from diverse categories: editing, paraphrasing, co-generating, and prompting. Our attacks assume limited access to the generator LLMs, and we compare the performance of detectors on different attacks under different budget levels. Our experiments reveal that almost none of the existing detectors remain robust under all the attacks, and all detectors exhibit different loopholes. Averaging all detectors, the performance drops by 35% across all attacks. Further, we investigate the reasons behind these defects and propose initial out-of-the-box patches.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.160	Yichen Wang, Shangbin Feng, Abe Hou, Xiao Pu, Chao Shen, Xiaoming Liu, Yulia Tsvetkov, Tianxing He
PRoLoRA: Partial Rotation Empowers More Parameter-Efficient LoRA	With the rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs), serving numerouslow-rank adaptations (LoRAs) concurrently has become increasingly impractical,leading to unaffordable costs and necessitating more parameter-efficientfinetuning methods. In this work, we introduce Partially Rotation-enhanced Low-Rank Adaptation (PRoLoRA) , an intra-layer sharing mechanism comprising fouressential components: broadcast reduction, rotation enhancement,partially-sharing refinement, and rectified initialization strategy. As asuperset of LoRA, PRoLoRA retains its advantages, and effectively circumventthe drawbacks of peer parameter-sharing methods with superior model capacity,practical feasibility, and broad applicability. Empirical experimentsdemonstrate the remarkably higher parameter efficiency of PRoLoRA in bothspecific parameter budget and performance target scenarios, and its scalabilityto larger LLMs. Notably, with one time less trainable parameters, PRoLoRA stilloutperforms LoRA on multiple instruction tuning datasets. Subsequently, anablation study is conducted to validate the necessity of individual componentsand highlight the superiority of PRoLoRA over three potential variants.Hopefully, the conspicuously higher parameter efficiency can establish PRoLoRAas a resource-friendly alternative to LoRA.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.156	Sheng Wang, Boyang Xue, Jiacheng Ye, Jiyue Jiang, Liheng Chen, Lingpeng Kong, Chuan Wu
Enhancing In-Context Learning via Implicit Demonstration Augmentation	The emergence of in-context learning (ICL) enables large pre-trained language models (PLMs) to make predictions for unseen inputs without updating parameters. Despite its potential, ICL's effectiveness heavily relies on the quality, quantity, and permutation of demonstrations, commonly leading to suboptimal and unstable performance. In this paper, we tackle this challenge for the first time from the perspective of demonstration augmentation. Specifically, we start with enriching representations of demonstrations by leveraging their deep feature distribution. We then theoretically reveal that when the number of augmented copies approaches infinity, the augmentation is approximately equal to a novel logit calibration mechanism integrated with specific statistical properties. This insight results in a simple yet highly efficient method that significantly improves the average and worst-case accuracy across diverse PLMs and tasks. Moreover, our method effectively reduces performance variance among varying demonstrations, permutations, and templates, and displays the capability to address imbalanced class distributions.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.155	Xiaoling Zhou, Wei Ye, Yidong Wang, Chaoya Jiang, Zhemg Lee, Rui Xie, Shikun Zhang
INTERS: Unlocking the Power of Large Language Models in Search with Instruction Tuning	Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various natural language processing tasks. Despite this, their application to information retrieval (IR) tasks is still challenging due to the infrequent occurrence of many IR-specific concepts in natural language. While prompt-based methods can provide task descriptions to LLMs, they often fall short in facilitating a comprehensive understanding and execution of IR tasks, thereby limiting LLMs' applicability. To address this gap, in this work, we explore the potential of instruction tuning to enhance LLMs' proficiency in IR tasks. We introduce a novel instruction tuning dataset, INTERS, encompassing 20 tasks across three fundamental IR categories: query understanding, document understanding, and query-document relationship understanding. The data are derived from 43 distinct datasets with manually written templates. Our empirical results reveal that INTERS significantly boosts the performance of various publicly available LLMs, such as LLaMA, Mistral, and Falcon, in IR tasks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of instruction design, template diversity, few-shot demonstrations, and the volume of instructions on performance. We make our dataset and the fine-tuned models publicly accessible at https://github.com/DaoD/INTERS.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.154	Yutao Zhu, Peitian Zhang, Chenghao Zhang, Yifei Chen, Binyu Xie, Zheng Liu, Ji-Rong Wen, Zhicheng Dou
On Context Utilization in Summarization with Large Language Models	Large language models (LLMs) excel in abstractive summarization tasks, delivering fluent and pertinent summaries. Recent advancements have extended their capabilities to handle long-input contexts, exceeding 100k tokens. However, in question answering, language models exhibit uneven utilization of their input context. They tend to favor the initial and final segments, resulting in a U-shaped performance pattern concerning where the answer is located within the input. This bias raises concerns, particularly in summarization where crucial content may be dispersed throughout the source document(s). Besides, in summarization, mapping facts from the source to the summary is not trivial as salient content is usually re-phrased. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study on context utilization and position bias in summarization. Our analysis encompasses 6 LLMs, 10 datasets, and 5 evaluation metrics. We introduce a new evaluation benchmark called MiddleSum on the which we benchmark two alternative inference methods to alleviate position bias: hierarchical summarization and incremental summarization. Our code and data can be found here: https://github.com/ntunlp/MiddleSum.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.153	Mathieu Ravaut, Aixin Sun, Nancy Chen, Shafiq Joty
Rethinking Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems: From Complex Modularity to Zero-Shot Autonomous Agent	Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems are predominantly designed to be composed of several functional modules (e.g. dialogue state tracker, dialogue policy, natural language generation) whether they are pipeline or end-to-end architectures. However, this modular design not only heavily relies on massive fully-annotated data, but also suffers from many intrinsic drawbacks, such as serious error accumulation, poor generalization ability, high customization cost, and low fault tolerance rate. In this paper, we rethink the architecture of the task-oriented dialogue systems and propose a novel fully zero-shot autonomous TOD agent, named AutoTOD, where all the delicate modules in traditional TOD systems are deprecated and all it needs is a general-purpose instruction-following language model (e.g. GPT-4). AutoTOD only leverages a simple instruction schema consisting of the description of tasks and external APIs, and can autonomously decide what to do at each dialogue turn, including asking for information, calling APIs, summarizing API results, and correcting previous mistakes. Moreover, we propose a simulation-based evaluation framework to better validate the abilities of TOD models in real-life scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted on the MultiWOZ and SGD datasets show the superior task completion ability and flexible language skills of AutoTOD.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.152	Heng-Da Xu, Xian-Ling Mao, Puhai Yang, Fanshu Sun, Heyan Huang
MathGenie: Generating Synthetic Data with Question Back-translation for Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning of LLMs	Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited great potential in mathematical reasoning. However, there remains a performance gap in this area between existing open-source models and closed-source models such as GPT-4. In this paper, we introduce MathGenie, a novel method for generating diverse and reliable math problems by leveraging the ground-truth solutions of the seed data. We augment these ground-truth solutions and use a specially finetuned model to translate these augmented solutions back into new questions. Subsequently, we generate code-integrated solutions for these questions. To ensure the correctness of the code-integrated solutions, we employ rationale-based verification for filtering. Then, we finetune various pretrained models, ranging from 7B to 70B, on the newly curated data, resulting in a family of models known as MathGenie. These models consistently outperform previous open-source models across five representative mathematical reasoning datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. In particular, MathGenie-InternLM2 achieves an accuracy of 87.7% on GSM8K and 55.7% on MATH, securing the best overall score.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.151	Zimu Lu, Aojun Zhou, Houxing Ren, Ke Wang, Weikang Shi, Junting Pan, Mingjie Zhan, Hongsheng Li
ItD: Large Language Models Can Teach Themselves Induction through Deduction	"Although Large Language Models (LLMs) are showing impressive performance on a wide range of Natural Language Processing tasks, researchers have found that they still have limited ability to conduct induction. Recent works mainly adopt ""post processes"" paradigms to improve the performance of LLMs on induction (e.g., the hypothesis search & refinement methods), but their performance is still constrained by the inherent inductive capability of the LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Induction through Deduction (ItD), to enable the LLMs to teach themselves induction through deduction. The ItD framework is composed of two main components: a Deductive Data Generation module to generate induction data and a Naive Bayesian Induction module to optimize the fine-tuning and decoding of LLMs. Our empirical results showcase the effectiveness of ItD on two induction benchmarks, achieving relative performance improvement of 36% and 10% compared with previous state-of-the-art, respectively. Our ablation study verifies the effectiveness of two key modules of ItD. We also verify the effectiveness of ItD across different LLMs and deductors.

Generalizing Conversational Dense Retrieval via LLM-Cognition Data Augmentation	Conversational search utilizes muli-turn natural language contexts to retrieve relevant passages. Existing conversational dense retrieval models mostly view a conversation as a fixed sequence of questions and responses, overlooking the severe data sparsity problem – that is, users can perform a conversation in various ways, and these alternate conversations are unrecorded. Consequently, they often struggle to generalize to diverse conversations in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a framework for generalizing Conversational dense retrieval via LLM-cognition data Augmentation (ConvAug). We first generate multi-level augmented conversations to capture the diverse nature of conversational contexts. Inspired by human cognition, we devise a cognition-aware prompting process to mitigate the generation of false positives, false negatives, and hallucinations. Moreover, we develop a difficulty-adaptive sample filter that selects challenging samples for complex conversations, thereby giving the model a larger learning space. A contrastive learning objective is then employed to train a better conversational context encoder. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets, under both normal and zero-shot settings, demonstrate the effectiveness, generalizability, and applicability of ConvAug. The code is released at https://github.com/haon-chen/ConvAug.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.149	Haonan Chen, Zhicheng Dou, Kelong Mao, Jiongnan Liu, Ziliang Zhao
Is Table Retrieval a Solved Problem? Exploring Join-Aware Multi-Table Retrieval	Retrieving relevant tables containing the necessary information to accurately answer a given question over tables is critical to open-domain question-answering (QA) systems. Previous methods assume the answer to such a question can be found either in a single table or multiple tables identified through question decomposition or rewriting. However, neither of these approaches is sufficient, as many questions require retrieving multiple tables and joining them through a join plan that cannot be discerned from the user query itself. If the join plan is not considered in the retrieval stage, the subsequent steps of reasoning and answering based on those retrieved tables are likely to be incorrect. To address this problem, we introduce a method that uncovers useful join relations for any query and database during table retrieval. We use a novel re-ranking method formulated as a mixed-integer program that considers not only table-query relevance but also table-table relevance that requires inferring join relationships. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for table retrieval by up to 9.3% in F1 score and for end-to-end QA by up to 5.4% in accuracy.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.148	Peter Baile Chen, Yi Zhang, Dan Roth
CopyNE: Better Contextual ASR by Copying Named Entities	End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have made significant progress in general scenarios. However, it remains challenging to transcribe contextual named entities (NEs) in the contextual ASR scenario. Previous approaches have attempted to address this by utilizing the NE dictionary. These approaches treat entities as individual tokens and generate them token-by-token, which may result in incomplete transcriptions of entities. In this paper, we treat entities as indivisible wholes and introduce the idea of copying into ASR. We design a systematic mechanism called CopyNE, which can copy entities from the NE dictionary. By copying all tokens of an entity at once, we can reduce errors during entity transcription, ensuring the completeness of the entity. Experiments demonstrate that CopyNE consistently improves the accuracy of transcribing entities compared to previous approaches. Even when based on the strong Whisper, CopyNE still achieves notable improvements.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.147	Shilin Zhou, Zhenghua Li, Yu Hong, Min Zhang, Zhefeng Wang, Baoxing Huai
MELA: Multilingual Evaluation of Linguistic Acceptability	In this work, we present the largest benchmark to date on linguistic acceptability: Multilingual Evaluation of Linguistic Acceptability—MELA, with 46K samples covering 10 languages from a diverse set of language families. We establish LLM baselines on this benchmark, and investigate cross-lingual transfer in acceptability judgements with XLM-R. In pursuit of multilingual interpretability, we conduct probing experiments with fine-tuned XLM-R to explore the process of syntax capability acquisition. Our results show that GPT-4o exhibits a strong multilingual ability, outperforming fine-tuned XLM-R, while open-source multilingual models lag behind by a noticeable gap. Cross-lingual transfer experiments show that transfer in acceptability judgment is non-trivial: 500 Icelandic fine-tuning examples lead to 23 MCC performance in a completely unrelated language—Chinese. Results of our probing experiments indicate that training on MELA improves the performance of XLM-R on syntax-related tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.146	Ziyin Zhang, Yikang Liu, Weifang Huang, Junyu Mao, Rui Wang, Hai Hu
Generative Pretrained Structured Transformers: Unsupervised Syntactic Language Models at Scale	A syntactic language model (SLM) incrementally generates a sentence with its syntactic tree in a left-to-right manner.We present Generative Pretrained Structured Transformers (GPST), an unsupervised SLM at scale capable of being pre-trained from scratch on raw texts with high parallelism. GPST circumvents the limitations of previous SLMs such as relying on gold trees and sequential training. It consists of two components, a usual SLM supervised by a uni-directional language modeling loss, and an additional composition model, which induces syntactic parse trees and computes constituent representations, supervised by a bi-directional language modeling loss. We propose a representation surrogate to enable joint parallel training of the two models in a hard-EM fashion.We pre-train GPST on OpenWebText, a corpus with billion tokens, and demonstrate the superiority of GPST over GPT-2 with a comparable size in numerous tasks covering both language understanding and language generation. Meanwhile, GPST also significantly outperforms existing unsupervised SLMs on left-to-right grammar induction, while holding a substantial acceleration on training.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.145	Xiang Hu, Pengyu Ji, Qingyang Zhu, Wei Wu, Kewei Tu
IMO: Greedy Layer-Wise Sparse Representation Learning for Out-of-Distribution Text Classification with Pre-trained Models	Machine learning models have made incredible progress, but they still struggle when applied to examples from unseen domains. This study focuses on a specific problem of domain generalization, where a model is trained on one source domain and tested on multiple target domains that are unseen during training. We propose IMO: Invariant features Masks for Out-of-Distribution text classification, to achieve OOD generalization by learning invariant features. During training, IMO would learn sparse mask layers to remove irrelevant features for prediction, where the remaining features keep invariant. Additionally, IMO has an attention module at the token level to focus on tokens that are useful for prediction. Our comprehensive experiments show that IMO substantially outperforms strong baselines in terms of various evaluation metrics and settings.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.144	Tao Feng, Lizhen Qu, Zhuang Li, Haolan Zhan, Yuncheng Hua, Reza Haf
SirLLM: Streaming Infinite Retentive LLM	"As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent in various domains, their ability to process inputs of any length and maintain a degree of memory becomes essential. However, the one-off input of overly long texts is limited, as studies have shown that when input lengths exceed the LLMs' pre-trained text length, there is a dramatic decline in text generation capabilities. Moreover, simply extending the length of pre-training texts is impractical due to the difficulty in obtaining long text data and the substantial memory consumption costs this would entail for LLMs. Recent efforts have employed streaming inputs to alleviate the pressure of excessively long text inputs, but this approach can significantly impair the model's long-term memory capabilities.Motivated by this challenge, we introduce Streaming Infinite Retentive LLM (SirLLM), which allows LLMs to maintain longer memory during infinite-length dialogues without the need for fine-tuning. SirLLM utilizes the Token Entropy metric and a memory decay mechanism to filter key phrases, endowing LLMs with both long-lasting and flexible memory. We designed three distinct tasks and constructed three datasets to measure the effectiveness of SirLLM from various angles: (1) DailyDialog; (2) Grocery Shopping; (3) Rock-Paper-Scissors. Our experimental results robustly demonstrate that SirLLM can achieve stable and significant improvements across different LLMs and tasks, compellingly proving its effectiveness.

Long-Context Language Modeling with Parallel Context Encoding	Extending large language models (LLMs) to process longer inputs is crucial for numerous applications. However, the considerable computational cost of transformers, coupled with limited generalization of positional encoding, restricts the size of their context window. We introduce Cross-Attention to Parallel Encodings (CAPE), a framework that can be applied to any existing decoder-only LLMs for context expansion. CAPE leverages a small encoder to process a long input chunk by chunk and enables the frozen decoder to cross-attend to the additional contexts. CAPE is efficient, generalizable, and versatile: trained with 8K-token documents, CAPE extends the context window of LLaMA-2 to 128K tokens, offering 10× of the throughput with only 1/6 of the memory. CAPE yields strong performance on language modeling and in-context learning. CAPE also excels in retrieval-augmented applications, while existing long-context models degenerate with retrieved contexts. We further introduce a CAPE variant that can extend the context window of instruction-tuned models with only unlabeled data, and showcase its effectiveness on LLaMA-2-Chat, leading to a strong instruction-following model that can leverage very long context on downstream tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.142	Howard Yen, Tianyu Gao, Danqi Chen
Time is Encoded in the Weights of Finetuned Language Models	We present time vectors, a simple tool to customize language models to new time periods. Time vectors are created by finetuning a language model on data from a single time (e.g., a year or month), and then subtracting the weights of the original pretrained model. This vector specifies a direction in weight space that, as our experiments show, improves performance on text from that time period. Time vectors specialized to adjacent time periods appear to be positioned closer together in a manifold. Using this structure, we interpolate between time vectors to induce new models that perform better on intervening and future time periods, without any additional training. We demonstrate the consistency of our findings across different tasks, domains, model sizes, and time scales. Our results suggest that time is encoded in the weight space of finetuned models.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.141	Kai Nylund, Suchin Gururangan, Noah Smith
RLHFPoison: Reward Poisoning Attack for Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback in Large Language Models	Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a methodology designed to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, playing an important role in LLMs alignment. Despite its advantages, RLHF relies on human annotators to rank the text, which can introduce potential security vulnerabilities if any adversarial annotator (i.e., attackers) manipulates the ranking score by up-ranking any malicious text to steer the LLM adversarially. To assess the red-teaming of RLHF against human preference data poisoning, we propose RankPoison, a poisoning attack method on candidates' selection of preference rank flipping to reach certain malicious behaviors (e.g., generating longer sequences, which can increase the computational cost). With poisoned dataset generated by RankPoison, we can perform poisoning attacks on LLMs to generate longer tokens without hurting the original safety alignment performance. Moreover, applying RankPoison, we also successfully implement a backdoor attack where LLMs can generate longer answers under questions with the trigger word. Our findings highlight critical security challenges in RLHF, underscoring the necessity for more robust alignment methods for LLMs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.140	Jiongxiao Wang, Junlin Wu, Muhao Chen, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik, Chaowei Xiao
Co-training for Low Resource Scientific Natural Language Inference	Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles. The automatic annotation method based on distant supervision for the training set of SciNLI, the first and most popular dataset for this task, results in label noise which inevitably degenerates the performance of classifiers. In this paper, we propose a novel co-training method that assigns weights based on the training dynamics of the classifiers to the distantly supervised labels, reflective of the manner they are used in the subsequent training epochs. That is, unlike the existing semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches, we consider the historical behavior of the classifiers to evaluate the quality of the automatically annotated labels. Furthermore, by assigning importance weights instead of filtering out examples based on an arbitrary threshold on the predicted confidence, we maximize the usage of automatically labeled data, while ensuring that the noisy labels have a minimal impact on model training. The proposed method obtains an improvement of 1.5% in Macro F1 over the distant supervision baseline, and substantial improvements over several other strong SSL baselines. We make our code and data available on Github.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.139	Mobashir Sadat, Cornelia Caragea
HyCoRec: Hypergraph-Enhanced Multi-Preference Learning for Alleviating Matthew Effect in Conversational Recommendation	The Matthew effect is a notorious issue in Recommender Systems (RSs), i.e., the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, wherein popular items are overexposed while less popular ones are regularly ignored. Most methods examine Matthew effect in static or nearly-static recommendation scenarios. However, the Matthew effect will be increasingly amplified when the user interacts with the system over time. To address these issues, we propose a novel paradigm, Hypergraph-Enhanced Multi-Preference Learning for Alleviating Matthew Effect in Conversational Recommendation (HyCoRec), which aims to alleviate the Matthew effect in conversational recommendation. Concretely, HyCoRec devotes to alleviate the Matthew effect by learning multi-aspect preferences, i.e., item-, entity-, word-, review-, and knowledge-aspect preferences, to effectively generate responses in the conversational task and accurately predict items in the recommendation task when the user chats with the system over time. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmarks validate that HyCoRec achieves new state-of-the-art performance and the superior of alleviating Matthew effect.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.138	Yongsen Zheng, Ruilin Xu, Ziliang Chen, Guohua Wang, Mingjie Qian, Jinghui Qin, Liang Lin
Extreme Miscalibration and the Illusion of Adversarial Robustness	Deep learning-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small perturbations can cause a model to misclassify. Adversarial Training (AT) is often used to increase model robustness. However, we have discovered an intriguing phenomenon: deliberately or accidentally miscalibrating models masks gradients in a way that interferes with adversarial attack search methods, giving rise to an apparent increase in robustness. We show that this observed gain in robustness is an illusion of robustness (IOR), and demonstrate how an adversary can perform various forms of test-time temperature calibration to nullify the aforementioned interference and allow the adversarial attack to find adversarial examples. Hence, we urge the NLP community to incorporate test-time temperature scaling into their robustness evaluations to ensure that any observed gains are genuine. Finally, we show how the temperature can be scaled during training to improve genuine robustness.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.137	Vyas Raina, Samson Tan, Volkan Cevher, Aditya Rawal, Sheng Zha, George Karypis
TransliCo: A Contrastive Learning Framework to Address the Script Barrier in Multilingual Pretrained Language Models	The world's more than 7000 languages are written in at least 293 scripts. Due to various reasons, many closely related languages use different scripts, which poses a difficulty for multilingual pretrained language models (mPLMs) in learning crosslingual knowledge through lexical overlap. As a consequence, mPLMs are faced with a script barrier: representations from different scripts are located in different subspaces, which can result in crosslingual transfer involving languages of different scripts performing suboptimally. To address this problem, we propose TransliCo, a framework that optimizes the Transliteration Contrastive Modeling (TCM) objective to fine-tune an mPLM by contrasting sentences in its training data and their transliterations in a unified script (in our case Latin), which enhances uniformity in the representation space for different scripts. Using Glot500-m, an mPLM pretrained on over 500 languages, as our source model, we fine-tune it on a small portion (5%) of its training data, and refer to the resulting model as Furina. We show that Furina not only better aligns representations from distinct scripts but also outperforms the original Glot500-m on various zero-shot crosslingual transfer tasks. Additionally, we achieve consistent improvement in a case study on the Indic group where the languages exhibit areal features but use different scripts. We make our code and models publicly available.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.136	Yihong Liu, Chunlan Ma, Haotian Ye, Hinrich Schuetze
Making Long-Context Language Models Better Multi-Hop Reasoners	Recent advancements in long-context modeling have enhanced language models (LMs) for complex tasks across multiple NLP applications. Despite this progress, we find that these models struggle with multi-hop reasoning and exhibit decreased performance in the presence of noisy contexts. In this paper, we introduce Reasoning with Attributions, a novel approach that prompts LMs to supply attributions for each assertion during their reasoning. We validate our approach through experiments on three multi-hop datasets, employing both proprietary and open-source models, and demonstrate its efficacy and resilience. Furthermore, we explore methods to augment reasoning capabilities via fine-tuning and offer an attribution-annotated dataset and a specialized training strategy. Our fine-tuned model achieves competitive performance on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, closely paralleling proprietary LMs such as ChatGPT and Claude-instant.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.135	Yanyang Li, Shuo Liang, Michael Lyu, Liwei Wang
VerifiNER: Verification-augmented NER via Knowledge-grounded Reasoning with Large Language Models	Recent approaches in domain-specific named entity recognition (NER), such as biomedical NER, have shown remarkable advances. However, they still lack of faithfulness, producing erroneous predictions. We assume that knowledge of entities can be useful in verifying the correctness of the predictions. Despite the usefulness of knowledge, resolving such errors with knowledge is nontrivial, since the knowledge itself does not directly indicate the ground-truth label. To this end, we propose VerifiNER, a post-hoc verification framework that identifies errors from existing NER methods using knowledge and revises them into more faithful predictions. Our framework leverages the reasoning abilities of large language models to adequately ground on knowledge and the contextual information in the verification process. We validate effectiveness of VerifiNER through extensive experiments on biomedical datasets. The results suggest that VerifiNER can successfully verify errors from existing models as a model-agnostic approach. Further analyses on out-of-domain and low-resource settings show the usefulness of VerifiNER on real-world applications.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.134	Seoyeon Kim, Kwangwook Seo, Hyungjoo Chae, Jinyoung Yeo, Dongha Lee
Unlocking Data-free Low-bit Quantization with Matrix Decomposition for KV Cache Compression	Key-value (KV) caching is an important technique to accelerate the inference of large language models (LLMs), but incurs significant memory overhead. To compress the size of KV cache, existing methods often compromise precision or require extra data for calibration, limiting their practicality in LLM deployment. In this paper, we introduce DecoQuant, a novel data-free low-bit quantization technique based on tensor decomposition methods, to effectively compress KV cache. Our core idea is to adjust the outlier distribution of the original matrix by performing tensor decomposition, so that the quantization difficulties are migrated from the matrix to decomposed local tensors. Specially, we find that outliers mainly concentrate on small local tensors, while large tensors tend to have a narrower value range. Based on this finding, we propose to apply low-bit quantization to the large tensor, while maintaining high-precision representation for the small tensor. Furthermore, we utilize the proposed quantization method to compress the KV cache of LLMs to accelerate the inference, and develop an efficient dequantization kernel tailored specifically for DecoQuant. Through extensive experiments, DecoQuant demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains, showcasing up to a 75% reduction in memory footprint while maintaining comparable generation quality.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.133	Peiyu Liu, Ze-Feng Gao, Xin Zhao, Yipeng Ma, Tao Wang, Ji-Rong Wen
Modality-Aware Integration with Large Language Models for Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering	Knowledge-based visual question answering (KVQA) has been extensively studied to answer visual questions with external knowledge, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). While several attempts have been proposed to leverage large language models (LLMs) as an implicit knowledge source, it remains challenging since LLMs may generate hallucinations. Moreover, multiple knowledge sources, e.g., images, KGs and LLMs, cannot be readily aligned for complex scenarios. To tackle these, we present a novel modality-aware integration with LLMs for KVQA ( MAIL ). It carefully leverages multimodal knowledge for both image understanding and knowledge reasoning. Specifically, (i) we propose a two-stage prompting strategy with LLMs to densely embody the image into a *scene graph* with detailed visual features; (ii) We construct a coupled *concept graph* by linking the mentioned entities with external facts. (iii) A tailored pseudo-siamese graph medium fusion is designed for sufficient multimodal fusion. We utilize the shared mentioned entities in two graphs as mediums to bridge a tight inter-modal exchange, while maximally preserving insightful intra-modal learning by constraining the fusion within mediums. Extensive experiments show the superiority of MAIL .	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.132	Junnan Dong, Qinggang Zhang, Huachi Zhou, Daochen Zha, Pai Zheng, Xiao Huang
Reasoning in Flux: Enhancing Large Language Models Reasoning through Uncertainty-aware Adaptive Guidance	Machine reasoning, which involves solving complex problems through step-by-step deduction and analysis, is a crucial indicator of the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, as the complexity of tasks escalates, LLMs often encounter increasing errors in their multi-step reasoning process. This study delves into the underlying factors contributing to these reasoning errors and seeks to leverage uncertainty to refine them. Specifically, we introduce Uncertainty-aware Adaptive Guidance (UAG), a novel approach for guiding LLM reasoning onto an accurate and reliable trajectory. UAG first identifies and evaluates uncertainty signals within each step of the reasoning chain. Upon detecting a significant increase in uncertainty, UAG intervenes by retracting to a previously reliable state and then introduces certified reasoning clues for refinement. By dynamically adjusting the reasoning process, UAG offers a plug-and-play solution for improving LLMs' performance in complex reasoning. Extensive experiments across various reasoning tasks demonstrate that UAG not only enhances the reasoning abilities of LLMs but also consistently outperforms several strong baselines with minimal computational overhead. Further analysis reveals that UAG is notably effective in identifying and diminishing reasoning errors.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.131	Zhangyue Yin, Qiushi Sun, Qipeng Guo, Zhiyuan Zeng, Xiaonan Li, Junqi Dai, Qinyuan Cheng, Xuanjing Huang, Xipeng Qiu
Surgical Feature-Space Decomposition of LLMs: Why, When and How?	Low-rank approximations, of the weight and feature space can enhance the performance of deep learning models, whether in terms of improving generalization or reducing the latency of inference. However, there is no clear consensus yet on how, when and why these approximations are helpful for large language models (LLMs). In this work, we empirically study the efficacy of weight and feature space decomposition in transformer-based LLMs. We demonstrate that surgical decomposition not only provides critical insights into the trade-off between compression and language modelling performance, but also sometimes enhances commonsense reasoning performance of LLMs. Our empirical analysis identifies specific network segments that intrinsically exhibit a low-rank structure. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the implications of low-rank approximations on model bias. Overall, our findings offer a novel perspective on optimizing LLMs, presenting the low-rank approximation not only as a tool for performance enhancements, but also as a means to potentially rectify biases within these models.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.130	Arnav Chavan, Nahush Lele, Deepak Gupta
MEFT: Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning through Sparse Adapter	Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) facilitates the fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) under limited resources. However, the fine-tuning performance with PEFT on complex, knowledge-intensive tasks is limited due to the constrained model capacity, which originates from the limited number of additional trainable parameters. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel mechanism that fine-tunes LLMs with adapters of larger size yet memory-efficient. This is achieved by leveraging the inherent activation sparsity in the Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) of LLMs and utilizing the larger capacity of Central Processing Unit (CPU) memory compared to Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). We store and update the parameters of larger adapters on the CPU. Moreover, we employ a Mixture of Experts (MoE)-like architecture to mitigate unnecessary CPU computations and reduce the communication volume between the GPU and CPU. This is particularly beneficial over the limited bandwidth of PCI Express (PCIe). Our method can achieve fine-tuning results comparable to those obtained with larger memory capacities, even when operating under more limited resources such as a 24GB memory single GPU setup, with acceptable loss in training efficiency. Our codes are available at https://github.com/CURRENTF/MEFT.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.129	Jitai Hao, Weiwei Sun, Xin Xin, Qi Meng, Zhumin Chen, Pengjie Ren, Zhaochun Ren
CANDLE: Iterative Conceptualization and Instantiation Distillation from Large Language Models for Commonsense Reasoning	The sequential process of conceptualization and instantiation is essential to generalizable commonsense reasoning as it allows the application of existing knowledge to unfamiliar scenarios. However, existing works tend to undervalue the step of instantiation and heavilyrely on pre-built concept taxonomies and human annotations to collect both types of knowledge, resulting in a lack of instantiated knowledge to complete reasoning, high cost, and limited scalability. To tackle these challenges, we introduce CANDLE (ConceptuAlizationand INstantiation Distillation from Large Language ModEls), a distillation framework that iteratively performs contextualized conceptualization and instantiation over commonsense knowledge bases by instructing large language models to generate both types of knowledge with critic filtering. By applying CANDLE to ATOMIC (Sap et al., 2019a), we construct a comprehensive knowledge base comprising six million conceptualizations and instantiated commonsense knowledge triples. Both types of knowledge are firmly rooted in the original ATOMIC dataset, and intrinsic evaluations demonstrate their exceptional quality and diversity. Empirical results indicate that distilling CANDLE on student models provides benefits across three downstream tasks. Our data and models are publicly available at https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/CANDLE.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.128	Weiqi Wang, Tianqing Fang, Chunyang Li, Haochen Shi, Wenxuan Ding, Baixuan Xu, Zhaowei Wang, Jiaxin Bai, Xin Liu, Cheng Jiayang, Chunkit Chan, Yangqiu Song
TaxoLLaMA: WordNet-based Model for Solving Multiple Lexical Semantic Tasks	"In this paper, we explore the capabilities of LLMs in capturing lexical-semantic knowledge from WordNet on the example of the LLaMA-2-7b model and test it on multiple lexical semantic tasks. As the outcome of our experiments, we present TaxoLLaMA, the ""all-in-one"" model for taxonomy-related tasks, lightweight due to 4-bit quantization and LoRA. TaxoLLaMA achieves 11 SOTA results, and 4 top-2 results out of 16 tasks on the Taxonomy Enrichment, Hypernym Discovery, Taxonomy Construction, and Lexical Entailment tasks. Moreover, it demonstrates a very strong zero-shot performance on Lexical Entailment and Taxonomy Construction with no fine-tuning. We also explore its hidden multilingual and domain adaptation capabilities with a little tuning or few-shot learning.

Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models in Computational Argumentation	Computational argumentation has become an essential tool in various domains, including law, public policy, and artificial intelligence. It is an emerging research field in natural language processing that attracts increasing attention. Research on computational argumentation mainly involves two types of tasks: argument mining and argument generation. As large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding context and generating natural language, it is worthwhile to evaluate the performance of LLMs on diverse computational argumentation tasks. This work aims to embark on an assessment of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, Flan models, and LLaMA2 models, in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. We organize existing tasks into six main categories and standardize the format of fourteen openly available datasets. In addition, we present a new benchmark dataset on counter speech generation that aims to holistically evaluate the end-to-end performance of LLMs on argument mining and argument generation. Extensive experiments show that LLMs exhibit commendable performance across most of the datasets, demonstrating their capabilities in the field of argumentation. Our analysis offers valuable suggestions for evaluating computational argumentation and its integration with LLMs in future research endeavors.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.126	Guizhen Chen, Liying Cheng, Anh Tuan Luu, Lidong Bing
ListT5: Listwise Reranking with Fusion-in-Decoder Improves Zero-shot Retrieval	We propose ListT5, a novel reranking approach based on Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) that handles multiple candidate passages at both train and inference time. We also introduce an efficient inference framework for listwise ranking based on m-ary tournament sort with output caching. We evaluate and compare our model on the BEIR benchmark for zero-shot retrieval task, demonstrating that ListT5 (1) outperforms the state-of-the-art RankT5 baseline with a notable +1.3 gain in the average NDCG@10 score, (2) has an efficiency comparable to pointwise ranking models and surpasses the efficiency of previous listwise ranking models, and (3) overcomes the lost-in-the-middle problem of previous listwise rerankers.

Benchmarking Knowledge Boundary for Large Language Models: A Different Perspective on Model Evaluation	In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the development of large language models, achieving remarkable performance across diverse tasks.To evaluate the knowledge ability of language models, previous studies have proposed lots of benchmarks based on question-answering pairs.We argue that it is not reliable and comprehensive to evaluate language models with a fixed question or limited paraphrases as the query, since language models are sensitive to prompt.Therefore, we introduce a novel concept named knowledge boundary to encompass both prompt-agnostic and prompt-sensitive knowledge within language models.Knowledge boundary avoids prompt sensitivity in language model evaluations, rendering them more dependable and robust.To explore the knowledge boundary for a given model, we propose projected gradient descent method with semantic constraints, a new algorithm designed to identify the optimal prompt for each piece of knowledge.Experiments demonstrate a superior performance of our algorithm in computing the knowledge boundary compared to existing methods.Furthermore, we evaluate the ability of multiple language models in several domains with knowledge boundary.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.124	Xunjian Yin, Xu Zhang, Jie Ruan, Xiaojun Wan
VariErr NLI: Separating Annotation Error from Human Label Variation	Human label variation arises when annotators assign different labels to the same item for valid reasons, while annotation errors occur when labels are assigned for invalid reasons. These two issues are prevalent in NLP benchmarks, yet existing research has studied them in isolation. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no prior work that focuses on teasing apart error from signal, especially in cases where signal is beyond black-and-white.To fill this gap, we introduce a systematic methodology and a new dataset, VariErr (variation versus error), focusing on the NLI task in English. We propose a 2-round annotation procedure with annotators explaining each label and subsequently judging the validity of label-explanation pairs.VariErr contains 7,732 validity judgments on 1,933 explanations for 500 re-annotated MNLI items. We assess the effectiveness of various automatic error detection (AED) methods and GPTs in uncovering errors versus human label variation. We find that state-of-the-art AED methods significantly underperform GPTs and humans. While GPT-4 is the best system, it still falls short of human performance. Our methodology is applicable beyond NLI, offering fertile ground for future research on error versus plausible variation, which in turn can yield better and more trustworthy NLP systems.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.123	Leon Weber-Genzel, Siyao Peng, Marie-Catherine De Marneffe, Barbara Plank
LRQuant: Learnable and Robust Post-Training Quantization for Large Language Models	"Post-training quantization (PTQ) for large language models (LLMs) significantly accelerates model inference and relieves memory constraints, without incurring model training. A ""smoothing paradigm"" is commonly used in LLM quantization, which transfers the quantization difficulty of activation to weight quantization using mathematically equivalent transformations. However, existing methods face two issues: 1) Most smoothing parameters are hand-crafted defined which leads to suboptimal results; 2) There are significant performance degradations when tested on unseen datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a robust learnable smooth-based PTQ framework, called LRQuant. Firstly, we consider a learnable paradigm to find optimal smoothing parameters which are initialized by logarithmic activation equivalent. In addition, we empirically found that only relying on MSE loss could hardly lead to optimal quantization results, and we then propose a novel loss function based on the negative logarithm of cosine similarity (NLC loss) between outputs of full-precision and quantized block. At last, we pioneeringly introduce Test-time adaptation (TTA) into LLM quantization, which allows for rapid model adaptation during testing to improve generalization performance. More surprisingly, we find that by using our TTA method, we can achieve better results on test sets than directly using test sets for calibration in some cases while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Enhancing Contrastive Learning with Noise-Guided Attack: Towards Continual Relation Extraction in the Wild	The principle of continual relation extraction (CRE) involves adapting to emerging novel relations while preserving old knowledge. Existing CRE approaches excel in preserving old knowledge but falter when confronted with contaminated data streams, likely due to an artificial assumption of no annotation errors. Recognizing the prevalence of noisy labels in real-world datasets, we introduce a more practical learning scenario, termed as noisy-CRE. In response to this challenge, we propose a noise-resistant contrastive framework called Noise-guided Attack in Contrastive Learning (NaCL), aimed at learning incremental corrupted relations. Diverging from conventional approaches like sample discarding or relabeling in the presence of noisy labels, NaCL takes a transformative route by modifying the feature space through targeted attack. This attack aims to align the feature space with the provided, albeit inaccurate, labels, thereby enhancing contrastive representations. Extensive empirical validations demonstrate the consistent performance improvement of NaCL with increasing noise rates, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.121	Ting Wu, Jingyi Liu, Rui Zheng, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang
A synthetic data approach for domain generalization of NLI models	Natural Language Inference (NLI) remains an important benchmark task for LLMs. NLI datasets are a springboard for transfer learning to other semantic tasks, and NLI models are standard tools for identifying the faithfulness of model-generated text. There are several large scale NLI datasets today, and models have improved greatly by hill-climbing on these collections. Yet their realistic performance on out-of-distribution/domain data is less well-understood. We explore the opportunity for synthetic high-quality datasets to adapt NLI models for zero-shot use in downstream applications across new and unseen text domains. We demonstrate a new approach for generating NLI data in diverse domains and lengths, so far not covered by existing training sets. The resulting examples have meaningful premises, the hypotheses are formed in creative ways rather than simple edits to a few premise tokens, and the labels have high accuracy. We show that models trained on this data (685K synthetic examples) have the best generalization to completely new downstream test settings. On the TRUE benchmark, a T5-small model trained with our data improves around 7% on average compared to training on the best alternative dataset. The improvements are more pronounced for smaller models, while still meaningful on a T5 XXL model. We also demonstrate gains on test sets when in-domain training data is augmented with our domain-general synthetic data.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.120	Mohammad Javad Hosseini, Andrey Petrov, Alex Fabrikant, Annie Louis
Open-Set Semi-Supervised Text Classification via Adversarial Disagreement Maximization	Open-Set Semi-Supervised Text Classification (OSTC) aims to train a classification model on a limited set of labeled texts, alongside plenty of unlabeled texts that include both in-distribution and out-of-distribution examples. In this paper, we revisit the main challenge in OSTC, i.e., outlier detection, from a measurement disagreement perspective and innovatively propose to improve OSTC performance by directly maximizing the measurement disagreements. Based on the properties of in-measurement and cross-measurements, we design an Adversarial Disagreement Maximization (ADM) model that synergeticly optimizes the measurement disagreements. In addition, we develop an abnormal example detection and measurement calibration approach to guarantee the effectiveness of ADM training. Experiment results and comprehensive analysis of three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.118	Junfan Chen, Richong Zhang, Junchi Chen, Chunming Hu
ToolSword: Unveiling Safety Issues of Large Language Models in Tool Learning Across Three Stages	Tool learning is widely acknowledged as a foundational approach or deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world scenarios. While current research primarily emphasizes leveraging tools to augment LLMs, it frequently neglects emerging safety considerations tied to their application. To fill this gap, we present ToolSword , a comprehensive framework dedicated to meticulously investigating safety issues linked to LLMs in tool learning. Specifically, ToolSword delineates six safety scenarios for LLMs in tool learning, encompassing malicious queries and jailbreak attacks in the input stage, noisy misdirection and risky cues in the execution stage, and harmful feedback and error conflicts in the output stage. Experiments conducted on 11 open-source and closed-source LLMs reveal enduring safety challenges in tool learning, such as handling harmful queries, employing risky tools, and delivering detrimental feedback, which even GPT-4 is susceptible to. Moreover, we conduct further studies with the aim of fostering research on tool learning safety. The data will be released upon acceptance of the paper.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.119	Junjie Ye, Sixian Li, Guanyu Li, Caishuang Huang, Songyang Gao, Yilong Wu, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui, Xuanjing Huang
MoPS: Modular Story Premise Synthesis for Open-Ended Automatic Story Generation	A story premise succinctly defines a story's main idea, foundation, and trajectory. It serves as the initial trigger in automatic story generation. Existing sources of story premises are limited by a lack of diversity, uneven quality, and high costs that make them difficult to scale. In response, we introduce Modular Story Premise Synthesis (MoPS) which breaks down story premises into modules like background and persona for automated design and generation. MoPS consists of three phases: (1) Pre-collect a consistent set of candidates for each module to form a nested dictionary. (2) Extract a key path from the nested dictionary as the premise design. (3) Instruct an LLM to integrate the design into a coherent premise sentence. Thorough evaluations demonstrate that our synthesized premises excel in diversity, fascination, completeness, and originality compared to those induced from large language models and captured from public story datasets. Similarly, the extended novels and scripts generated from our premises also exhibit higher quality. In supplementary materials, we provide the MoPS code suite, along with 7.5k generated premises and 1k extended stories.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.117	Yan Ma, Yu Qiao, Pengfei Liu
REANO: Optimising Retrieval-Augmented Reader Models through Knowledge Graph Generation	Open domain question answering (ODQA) aims to answer questions with knowledge from an external corpus. Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) is an effective retrieval-augmented reader model to address this task. Given that FiD independently encodes passages, which overlooks the semantic relationships between passages, some studies use knowledge graphs (KGs) to establish dependencies among passages. However, they only leverage knowledge triples from existing KGs, which suffer from incompleteness and may lack certain information critical for answering given questions. To this end, in order to capture the dependencies between passages while tacking the issue of incompleteness in existing KGs, we propose to enhance the retrieval-augmented reader model with a knowledge graph generation module (REANO). Specifically, REANO consists of a KG generator and an answer predictor. The KG generator aims to generate KGs from the passages and the answer predictor then generates answers based on the passages and the generated KGs. Experimental results on five ODQA datasets indicate that compared with baselines, REANO can improve the exact match score by up to 2.7% on the EntityQuestion dataset, with an average improvement of 1.8% across all the datasets.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.115	Jinyuan Fang, Zaiqiao Meng, Craig MacDonald
Learning Disentangled Semantic Spaces of Explanations via Invertible Neural Networks	Disentangled latent spaces usually have better semantic separability and geometrical properties, which leads to better interpretability and more controllable data generation. While this has been well investigated in Computer Vision, in tasks such as image disentanglement, in the NLP domain, sentence disentanglement is still comparatively under-investigated. Most previous work have concentrated on disentangling task-specific generative factors, such as sentiment, within the context of style transfer. In this work, we focus on a more general form of sentence disentanglement, targeting the localised modification and control of more general sentence semantic features. To achieve this, we contribute to a novel notion of sentence semantic disentanglement and introduce a flow-based invertible neural network (INN) mechanism integrated with a transformer-based language Autoencoder (AE) in order to deliver latent spaces with better separability properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the model can conform the distributed latent space into a better semantically disentangled sentence space, leading to improved language interpretability and controlled generation when compared to the recent state-of-the-art language VAE models.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.116	Yingji Zhang, Danilo Carvalho, Andre Freitas
Handling Ambiguity in Emotion: From Out-of-Domain Detection to Distribution Estimation	The subjective perception of emotion leads to inconsistent labels from human annotators. Typically, utterances lacking majority-agreed labels are excluded when training an emotion classifier, which cause problems when encountering ambiguous emotional expressions during testing. This paper investigates three methods to handle ambiguous emotion. First, we show that incorporating utterances without majority-agreed labels as an additional class in the classifier reduces the classification performance of the other emotion classes. Then, we propose detecting utterances with ambiguous emotions as out-of-domain samples by quantifying the uncertainty in emotion classification using evidential deep learning. This approach retains the classification accuracy while effectively detects ambiguous emotion expressions. Furthermore, to obtain fine-grained distinctions among ambiguous emotions, we propose representing emotion as a distribution instead of a single class label. The task is thus re-framed from classification to distribution estimation where every individual annotation is taken into account, not just the majority opinion. The evidential uncertainty measure is extended to quantify the uncertainty in emotion distribution estimation. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and CREMA-D datasets demonstrate the superior capability of the proposed method in terms of majority class prediction, emotion distribution estimation, and uncertainty estimation.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.114	Wen Wu, Bo Li, Chao Zhang, Chung-Cheng Chiu, Qiujia Li, Junwen Bai, Tara Sainath, Phil Woodland
SparseFit: Few-shot Prompting with Sparse Fine-tuning for Jointly Generating Predictions and Natural Language Explanations	Models that generate natural language explanations (NLEs) for their predictions have recently gained increasing interest. However, this approach usually demands large datasets of human-written NLEs for the ground-truth answers at training time, which can be expensive and potentially infeasible for some applications. When only a few NLEs are available (a few-shot setup), fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) in conjunction with prompt-based learning has recently shown promising results. However, PLMs typically have billions of parameters, making full fine-tuning expensive. We propose SparseFit, a sparse few-shot fine-tuning strategy that leverages discrete prompts to jointly generate predictions and NLEs. We experiment with SparseFit on three sizes of the T5 language model and four datasets and compare it against existing state-of-the-art Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques. We find that fine-tuning only 6.8% of the model parameters leads to competitive results for both the task performance and the quality of the generated NLEs compared to full fine-tuning of the model and produces better results on average than other PEFT methods in terms of predictive accuracy and NLE quality.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.113	Jesus Solano, Mardhiyah Sanni, Oana-Maria Camburu, Pasquale Minervini
DM-BLI: Dynamic Multiple Subspaces Alignment for Unsupervised Bilingual Lexicon Induction	Unsupervised bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) task aims to find word translations between languages and has achieved great success in similar language pairs. However, related works mostly rely on a single linear mapping for language alignment and fail on distant or low-resource language pairs, achieving less than half the performance observed in rich-resource language pairs. In this paper, we introduce DM-BLI, a Dynamic Multiple subspaces alignment framework for unsupervised BLI. DM-BLI improves language alignment by utilizing multiple subspace alignments instead of a single mapping. We begin via unsupervised clustering to discover these subspaces in source embedding space. Then we identify and align corresponding subspaces in the target space using a rough global alignment. DM-BLI further employs intra-cluster and inter-cluster contrastive learning to refine precise alignment for each subspace pair. Experiments conducted on standard BLI datasets for 12 language pairs (6 rich-resource and 6 low-resource) demonstrate substantial gains achieved by our framework. We release our code at https://github.com/huling-2/DM-BLI.git.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.112	Ling Hu, Yuemei Xu

This work introduces ValueBench, the first comprehensive psychometric benchmark for evaluating value orientations and understanding in LLMs. ValueBench collects data from 44 established psychometric inventories, encompassing 453 multifaceted value dimensions. We propose an evaluation pipeline grounded in realistic human-AI interactions to probe value orientations, along with novel tasks for evaluating value understanding in an open-ended value space. With extensive experiments conducted on six representative LLMs, we unveil their shared and distinctive value orientations and exhibit their ability to approximate expert conclusions in value-related extraction and generation tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.111	Yuanyi Ren, Haoran Ye, Hanjun Fang, Xin Zhang, Guojie Song
Navigating the Metrics Maze: Reconciling Score Magnitudes and Accuracies	"Ten years ago a single metric, BLEU, governed progress in machine translation research. For better or worse, there is no such consensus today, and consequently it is difficult for researchers to develop and retain intuitions about metric deltas that drove earlier research and deployment decisions. This paper investigates the ""dynamic range"" of a number of modern metrics in an effort to provide a collective understanding of the meaning of differences in scores both within and among metrics; in other words, we ask ""what point difference x in metric y is required between two systems for humans to notice?"". We conduct our evaluation on a new large dataset, ToShip23, using it to discover deltas at which metrics achieve system-level differences that are meaningful to humans, which we measure by pairwise system accuracy. We additionally show that this method of establishing delta-accuracy is more stable than the standard use of statistical p-values in regards to testset size. Where data size permits, we also explore the effect of metric deltas and accuracy across finer-grained features such as translation direction, domain, and system closeness."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.110	Tom Kocmi, Vilém Zouhar, Christian Federmann, Matt Post
AIR-Bench: Benchmarking Large Audio-Language Models via Generative Comprehension	Recently, instruction-following audio-language models have received broad attention for human-audio interaction. However, the absence of benchmarks capable of evaluating audio-centric interaction capabilities has impeded advancements in this field. Previous models primarily focus on assessing different fundamental tasks, such as automatic speech recognition, and lack an assessment of the open-ended generative capabilities centered around audio. Thus, it is challenging to track the progression in the Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) domain and to provide guidance for future improvement.In this paper, we introduce AIR-Bench (Audio InstRuction Benchmark), the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LALMs to understand various types of audio signals (including human speech, natural sounds, and music), and furthermore, to interact with humans in the textual format. AIR-Bench encompasses two dimensions: foundation and chat benchmarks. The former consists of 19 tasks with approximately 19k single-choice questions, intending to inspect the basic single-task ability of LALMs. The latter one contains 2k instances of open-ended question-and-answer data, directly assessing the comprehension of the model on complex audio and its capacity to follow instructions. Both benchmarks require the model to generate hypotheses directly. We design a unified framework that leverages advanced language models, such as GPT-4, to evaluate the scores of generated hypotheses given the meta-information of the audio. Experimental results demonstrate a high level of consistency between GPT-4-based evaluation and human evaluation. By revealing the limitations of existing LALMs through evaluation results, AIR-Bench can provide insights into the direction of future research.

M-RAG: Reinforcing Large Language Model Performance through Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Multiple Partitions	Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant memories from an external database. However, existing RAG methods typically organize all memories in a whole database, potentially limiting focus on crucial memories and introducing noise. In this paper, we introduce a multiple partition paradigm for RAG (called M-RAG), where each database partition serves as a basic unit for RAG execution. Based on this paradigm, we propose a novel framework that leverages LLMs with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning to optimize different language generation tasks explicitly. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on seven datasets, spanning three language generation tasks and involving three distinct language model architectures, we confirm that M-RAG consistently outperforms various baseline methods, achieving improvements of 11%, 8%, and 12% for text summarization, machine translation, and dialogue generation, respectively.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.108	Zheng Wang, Shu Teo, Jieer Ouyang, Yongjun Xu, Wei Shi
Self-Alignment for Factuality: Mitigating Hallucinations in LLMs via Self-Evaluation	"Despite showing impressive abilities, large language models (LLMs) often struggle with factual inaccuracies, i.e., ""hallucinations"", even when they hold relevant knowledge. To mitigate these hallucinations, current approaches typically necessitate high-quality human factuality annotations. In this work, we explore Self-Alignment for Factuality, where we leverage the self-evaluation capability of an LLM to provide training signals that steer the model towards factuality. Specifically, we incorporate Self-Eval, a self-evaluation component, to prompt an LLM to validate the factuality of its own generated responses solely based on its internal knowledge. Additionally, we design Self-Knowledge Tuning (SK-Tuning) to augment the LLM's self-evaluation ability by improving the model's confidence estimation and calibration. We then utilize these self-annotated responses to fine-tune the model via Direct Preference Optimization algorithm. We show that the proposed self-alignment approach substantially enhances factual accuracy over Llama family models across three key knowledge-intensive tasks on TruthfulQA and BioGEN."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.107	Xiaoying Zhang, Baolin Peng, Ye Tian, Jingyan Zhou, Lifeng Jin, Linfeng Song, Haitao Mi, Helen Meng
LoRAMoE: Alleviating World Knowledge Forgetting in Large Language Models via MoE-Style Plugin	Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a crucial step for large language models (LLMs), enabling them to align with human instructions and enhance their capabilities in downstream tasks. Substantially increasing instruction data is a direct solution to align the model with a broader range of downstream tasks or notably improve its performance on a specific task. However, we find that large-scale increases in instruction data can damage the world knowledge previously stored in LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose LoRAMoE, a novelty framework that introduces several low-rank adapters (LoRA) and integrates them by using a router network, like a plugin version of Mixture of Experts (MoE). It freezes the backbone model and forces a portion of LoRAs to focus on leveraging world knowledge to solve downstream tasks, to alleviate world knowledge forgetting. Experimental results show that, as the instruction data increases, LoRAMoE can significantly improve the ability to process downstream tasks, while maintaining the world knowledge stored in the LLM.

Towards Faithful and Robust LLM Specialists for Evidence-Based Question-Answering	Advances towards more faithful and traceable answers of Large Language Models (LLMs) are crucial for various research and practical endeavors. One avenue in reaching this goal is basing the answers on reliable sources. However, this Evidence-Based QA has proven to work insufficiently with LLMs in terms of citing the correct sources (source quality) and truthfully representing the information within sources (answer attributability). In this work, we systematically investigate how to robustly fine-tune LLMs for better source quality and answer attributability. Specifically, we introduce a data generation pipeline with automated data quality filters, which can synthesize diversified high-quality training and testing data at scale. We further introduce four test sets to benchmark the robustness of fine-tuned specialist models. Extensive evaluation shows that fine-tuning on synthetic data improves performance on both in- and out-of-distribution. Furthermore, we show that data quality, which can be drastically improved by proposed quality filters, matters more than quantity in improving Evidence-Based QA.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.105	Tobias Schimanski, Jingwei Ni, Mathias Kraus, Elliott Ash, Markus Leippold
AFaCTA: Assisting the Annotation of Factual Claim Detection with Reliable LLM Annotators	With the rise of generative AI, automated fact-checking methods to combat misinformation are becoming more and more important. However, factual claim detection, the first step in a fact-checking pipeline, suffers from two key issues that limit its scalability and generalizability: (1) inconsistency in definitions of the task and what a claim is, and (2) the high cost of manual annotation. To address (1), we review the definitions in related work and propose a unifying definition of factual claims that focuses on verifiability. To address (2), we introduce AFaCTA (Automatic Factual Claim deTection Annotator), a novel framework that assists in the annotation of factual claims with the help of large language models (LLMs). AFaCTA calibrates its annotation confidence with consistency along three predefined reasoning paths. Extensive evaluation and experiments in the domain of political speech reveal that AFaCTA can efficiently assist experts in annotating factual claims and training high-quality classifiers, and can work with or without expert supervision. Our analyses also result in PoliClaim, a comprehensive claim detection dataset spanning diverse political topics.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.104	Jingwei Ni, Minjing Shi, Dominik Stammbach, Mrinmaya Sachan, Elliott Ash, Markus Leippold
Does DetectGPT Fully Utilize Perturbation? Bridging Selective Perturbation to Fine-tuned Contrastive Learning Detector would be Better	The burgeoning generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have raised growing concerns about abuse, demanding automatic machine-generated text detectors. DetectGPT, a zero-shot metric-based detector, first introduces perturbation and shows great performance improvement. However, in DetectGPT, the random perturbation strategy could introduce noise, and logit regression depends on the threshold, harming the generalizability and applicability of individual or small-batch inputs. Hence, we propose a novel fine-tuned detector, PECOLA, bridging metric-based and fine-tuned methods by contrastive learning on selective perturbation. Selective strategy retains important tokens during perturbation and weights for multi-pair contrastive learning. The experiments show that PECOLA outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 1.20% in accuracy on average on four public datasets. And we further analyze the effectiveness, robustness, and generalization of the method.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.103	Shengchao Liu, Xiaoming Liu, Yichen Wang, Zehua Cheng, Chengzhengxu Li, Zhaohan Zhang, Yu Lan, Chao Shen
InCharacter: Evaluating Personality Fidelity in Role-Playing Agents through Psychological Interviews	Role-playing agents (RPAs), powered by large language models, have emerged as a flourishing field of applications. However, a key challenge lies in assessing whether RPAs accurately reproduce the personas of target characters, namely their character fidelity. Existing methods mainly focus on the knowledge and linguistic patterns of characters. This paper, instead, introduces a novel perspective to evaluate the personality fidelity of RPAs with psychological scales. Overcoming drawbacks of previous self-report assessments on RPAs, we propose InCharacter, namely **In**terviewing **Character** agents for personality tests. Experiments include various types of RPAs and LLMs, covering 32 distinct characters on 14 widely used psychological scales. The results validate the effectiveness of InCharacter in measuring RPA personalities. Then, with InCharacter, we show that state-of-the-art RPAs exhibit personalities highly aligned with the human-perceived personalities of the characters, achieving an accuracy up to 80.7%.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.102	Xintao Wang, Yunze Xiao, Jen-tse Huang, Siyu Yuan, Rui Xu, Haoran Guo, Quan Tu, Yaying Fei, Ziang Leng, Wei Wang, Jiangjie Chen, Cheng Li, Yanghua Xiao
AoE: Angle-optimized Embeddings for Semantic Textual Similarity	Text embedding is pivotal in semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, which are crucial components in Large Language Model (LLM) applications. STS learning largely relies on the cosine function as the optimization objective to reflect semantic similarity. However, the cosine has saturation zones rendering vanishing gradients and hindering learning subtle semantic differences in text embeddings. To address this issue, we propose a novel Angle-optimized Embedding model, AoE. It optimizes angle differences in complex space to explore similarity in saturation zones better. To set up a comprehensive evaluation, we experimented with existing short-text STS, our newly collected long-text STS, and downstream task datasets. Extensive experimental results on STS and MTEB benchmarks show that AoE significantly outperforms popular text embedding models neglecting cosine saturation zones. It highlights that AoE can produce high-quality text embeddings and broadly benefit downstream tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.101	Xianming Li, Jing Li
UniCoder: Scaling Code Large Language Model via Universal Code	Intermediate reasoning or acting steps have successfully improved large language models (LLMs) for handling various downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks.When applying LLMs for code generation, recent works mainly focus on directing the models to articulate intermediate natural-language reasoning steps, as in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and then output code with the natural language or other structured intermediate steps. However, such output is not suitable for code translation or generation tasks since the standard CoT has different logical structures and forms of expression with the code. In this work, we introduce the universal code (UniCode) as the intermediate representation. It is a description of algorithm steps using a mix of conventions of programming languages, such as assignment operator, conditional operator, and loop. Hence, we collect an instruction dataset UniCoder-Instruct to train our model UniCoder on multi-task learning objectives. UniCoder-Instruct comprises natural-language questions, code solutions, and the corresponding universal code. The alignment between the intermediate universal code representation and the final code solution significantly improves the quality of the generated code. The experimental results demonstrate that UniCoder with the universal code significantly outperforms the previous prompting methods by a large margin, showcasing the effectiveness of the structural clues in pseudo-code.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.100	Tao Sun, Linzheng Chai, Jian Yang, Yuwei Yin, Hongcheng Guo, Jiaheng Liu, Bing Wang, Liqun Yang, Zhoujun Li
Dissecting Human and LLM Preferences	As a relative quality comparison of model responses, human and Large Language Model (LLM) preferences serve as common alignment goals in model fine-tuning and criteria in evaluation. Yet, these preferences merely reflect broad tendencies, resulting in less explainable and controllable models with potential safety risks. In this work, we dissect the preferences of human and 32 different LLMs to understand their quantitative composition, using annotations from real-world user-model conversations for a fine-grained, scenario-wise analysis. We find that humans are less sensitive to errors, favor responses that support their stances, and show clear dislike when models admit their limits. On the contrary, advanced LLMs like GPT-4-Turbo emphasize correctness, clarity, and harmlessness more. Additionally, LLMs of similar sizes tend to exhibit similar preferences, regardless of their training methods, and fine-tuning for alignment does not significantly alter the preferences of pretrained-only LLMs. Finally, we show that preference-based evaluation can be intentionally manipulated. In both training-free and training-based settings, aligning a model with the preferences of judges boosts scores, while injecting the least preferred properties lowers them. This results in notable score shifts: up to 0.59 on MT-Bench (1-10 scale) and 31.94 on AlpacaEval 2.0 (0-100 scale), highlighting the significant impact of this strategic adaptation. We have made all resources of this project publicly available.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.99	Junlong Li, Fan Zhou, Shichao Sun, Yikai Zhang, Hai Zhao, Pengfei Liu
Selene: Pioneering Automated Proof in Software Verification	Ensuring correctness is a pivotal aspect of software engineering. Among the various strategies available, software verification offers a definitive assurance of correctness. Nevertheless, writing verification proofs is resource-intensive and manpower-consuming, and there is a great need to automate this process. We introduce Selene in this paper, which is the first project-level automated proof benchmark constructed based on the real-world industrial-level operating system microkernel, seL4. Selene provides a comprehensive framework for end-to-end proof generation and a lightweight verification environment. Our experimental results with advanced large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4, highlight the capabilities of LLMs in the domain of automated proof generation. Additionally, our further proposed augmentations indicate that the challenges presented by Selene can be mitigated in future research endeavors.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.98	Lichen Zhang, Shuai Lu, Nan Duan
Generative Pre-trained Speech Language Model with Efficient Hierarchical Transformer	"While recent advancements in speech language models have achieved significant progress, they face remarkable challenges in modeling the long acoustic sequences of neural audio codecs. In this paper, we introduce Generative Pre-trained Speech Transformer (GPST), a hierarchical transformer designed for efficient speech language modeling. GPST quantizes audio waveforms into two distinct types of discrete speech representations and integrates them within a hierarchical transformer architecture, allowing for a unified one-stage generation process and enhancing Hi-Res audio generation capabilities. By training on large corpora of speeches in an end-to-end unsupervised manner, GPST can generate syntactically consistent speech with diverse speaker identities. Given a brief 3-second prompt, GPST can produce natural and coherent personalized speech, demonstrating in-context learning abilities. Moreover, our approach can be easily extended to spoken cross-lingual speech generation by incorporating multi-lingual semantic tokens and universal acoustic tokens. Experimental results indicate that GPST significantly outperforms the existing speech language models in terms of word error rate, speech quality, and speaker similarity. See <a href=""https://youngsheen.github.io/GPST/demo"" class=""acl-markup-url"">https://youngsheen.github.io/GPST/demo for demo samples."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.97	Yongxin Zhu, Dan Su, Liqiang He, Linli Xu, Dong Yu
Detection-Correction Structure via General Language Model for Grammatical Error Correction	Grammatical error correction (GEC) is a task dedicated to rectifying texts with minimal edits, which can be decoupled into two components: detection and correction. However, previous works have predominantly focused on direct correction, with no prior efforts to integrate both into a single model. Moreover, the exploration of the detection-correction paradigm by large language models (LLMs) remains underdeveloped. This paper introduces an integrated detection-correction structure, named DeCoGLM, based on the General Language Model (GLM). The detection phase employs a fault-tolerant detection template, while the correction phase leverages autoregressive mask infilling for localized error correction. Through the strategic organization of input tokens and modification of attention masks, we facilitate multi-task learning within a single model. Our model demonstrates competitive performance against the state-of-the-art models on English and Chinese GEC datasets. Further experiments present the effectiveness of the detection-correction structure in LLMs, suggesting a promising direction for GEC.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.96	Wei Li, Houfeng Wang
An Effective Pronunciation Assessment Approach Leveraging Hierarchical Transformers and Pre-training Strategies	Automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) manages to quantify a second language (L2) learner's pronunciation proficiency in a target language by providing fine-grained feedback with multiple pronunciation aspect scores at various linguistic levels. Most existing efforts on APA typically parallelize the modeling process, namely predicting multiple aspect scores across various linguistic levels simultaneously. This inevitably makes both the hierarchy of linguistic units and the relatedness among the pronunciation aspects sidelined. Recognizing such a limitation, we in this paper first introduce HierTFR, a hierarchal APA method that jointly models the intrinsic structures of an utterance while considering the relatedness among the pronunciation aspects. We also propose a correlation-aware regularizer to strengthen the connection between the estimated scores and the human annotations. Furthermore, novel pre-training strategies tailored for different linguistic levels are put forward so as to facilitate better model initialization. An extensive set of empirical experiments conducted on the speechocean762 benchmark dataset suggest the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach in relation to several competitive baselines.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.95	Bi-Cheng Yan, Jiun-Ting Li, Yi-Cheng Wang, Hsin Wei Wang, Tien-Hong Lo, Yung-Chang Hsu, Wei-Cheng Chao, Berlin Chen
Multimodal Prompt Learning with Missing Modalities for Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Recognition	The development of multimodal models has significantly advanced multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition. However, in real-world applications, the presence of various missing modality cases often leads to a degradation in the model's performance. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal Transformer framework using prompt learning to address the issue of missing modalities. Our method introduces three types of prompts: generative prompts, missing-signal prompts, and missing-type prompts. These prompts enable the generation of missing modality features and facilitate the learning of intra- and inter-modality information. Through prompt learning, we achieve a substantial reduction in the number of trainable parameters. Our proposed method outperforms other methods significantly across all evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, showcasing its ability to effectively handle missing modalities.

HealMe: Harnessing Cognitive Reframing in Large Language Models for Psychotherapy	Large Language Models (LLMs) can play a vital role in psychotherapy by adeptly handling the crucial task of cognitive reframing and overcoming challenges such as shame, distrust, therapist skill variability, and resource scarcity. Previous LLMs in cognitive reframing mainly converted negative emotions to positive ones, but these approaches have limited efficacy, often not promoting clients' self-discovery of alternative perspectives. In this paper, we unveil the Helping and Empowering through Adaptive Language in Mental Enhancement (HealMe) model. This novel cognitive reframing therapy method effectively addresses deep-rooted negative thoughts and fosters rational, balanced perspectives. Diverging from traditional LLM methods, HealMe employs empathetic dialogue based on psychotherapeutic frameworks. It systematically guides clients through distinguishing circumstances from feelings, brainstorming alternative viewpoints, and developing empathetic, actionable suggestions. Moreover, we adopt the first comprehensive and expertly crafted psychological evaluation metrics, specifically designed to rigorously assess the performance of cognitive reframing, in both AI-simulated dialogues and real-world therapeutic conversations. Experimental results show that our model outperforms others in terms of empathy, guidance, and logical coherence, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential positive impact on psychotherapy.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.93	Mengxi Xiao, Qianqian Xie, Ziyan Kuang, Zhicheng Liu, Kailai Yang, Min Peng, Weiguang Han, Jimin Huang
Persuading across Diverse Domains: a Dataset and Persuasion Large Language Model	Persuasive dialogue requires multi-turn following and planning abilities to achieve the goal of persuading users, which is still challenging even for state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Previous works focus on retrieval-based models or generative models in a specific domain due to a lack of data across multiple domains. In this paper, we leverage GPT-4 to create the first multi-domain persuasive dialogue dataset DailyPersuasion. Then we propose a general method named PersuGPT to learn a persuasion model based on LLMs through intent-to-strategy reasoning, which summarizes the intent of user's utterance and reasons next strategy to respond. Moreover, we design a simulation-based preference optimization, which utilizes a learned user model and our model to simulate next turns and estimate their rewards more accurately. Experimental results on two datasets indicate that our proposed method outperforms all baselines in terms of automatic evaluation metric Win-Rate and human evaluation.

LongLLMLingua: Accelerating and Enhancing LLMs in Long Context Scenarios via Prompt Compression	In long context scenarios, large language models (LLMs) face three main challenges: higher computational cost, performance reduction, and position bias. Research indicates that LLM performance hinges on the density and position of key information in the input prompt. Inspired by these findings, we propose LongLLMLingua for prompt compression towards improving LLMs' perception of the key information to simultaneously address the three challenges. Our extensive evaluation across various long context scenarios demonstrates that LongLLMLingua not only enhances performance but also significantly reduces costs and latency. For instance, in the NaturalQuestions benchmark, LongLLMLingua boosts performance by up to 21.4% with around 4x fewer tokens in GPT-3.5-Turbo, leading to substantial cost savings. It achieves a 94.0% cost reduction in the LooGLE benchmark. Moreover, when compressing prompts of about 10k tokens at ratios of 2x-6x, LongLLMLingua can accelerate end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.6x.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.91	Huiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Xufang Luo, Dongsheng Li, Chin-Yew Lin, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu
Evaluating Intention Detection Capability of Large Language Models in Persuasive Dialogues	We investigate intention detection in persuasive multi-turn dialogs employing the largest available Large Language Models (LLMs).Much of the prior research measures the intention detection capability of machine learning models without considering the conversational history.To evaluate LLMs' intention detection capability in conversation, we modified the existing datasets of persuasive conversation and created datasets using a multiple-choice paradigm.It is crucial to consider others' perspectives through their utterances when engaging in a persuasive conversation, especially when making a request or reply that is inconvenient for others.This feature makes the persuasive dialogue suitable for the dataset of measuring intention detection capability.We incorporate the concept of 'face acts,' which categorize how utterances affect mental states.This approach enables us to measure intention detection capability by focusing on crucial intentions and to conduct comprehensible analysis according to intention types.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.90	Hiromasa Sakurai, Yusuke Miyao
Language Model Adaption for Reinforcement Learning with Natural Language Action Space	Reinforcement learning with natural language action space often suffers from the curse of dimensionality due to the combinatorial nature of the natural language. Previous research leverages pretrained language models to capture action semantics and reduce the size of the action space. However, since pretrained models are typically trained on general corpora, there can be an unpredictable mismatch between the priors encoded in pretrained models and the characteristics of the specific RL environment. To address this issue, we propose Mutual-Information Regularized Policy Optimization, MIPO. MIPO enables implicit and dynamic reduction of the action space. Starting from the prior provided by the pretrained language model, our method dynamically adjusts the prior during the learning process based on the guidance of mutual information regularization. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this policy optimization process leads to the monotonic improvement on the mutual-information regularized RL objective. Empirically, we conduct experiments in various environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of MIPO.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.89	Jiangxing Wang, Jiachen Li, Xiao Han, Deheng Ye, Zongqing Lu
IBSEN: Director-Actor Agent Collaboration for Controllable and Interactive Drama Script Generation	Large language models have demonstrated their capabilities in storyline creation and human-like character role-playing. Current language model agents mainly focus on reasonable behaviors from the level of individuals, and their behaviors might be hard to constraint on the level of the whole storyline. In this paper we introduce IBSEN, a director-actor coordinate agent framework that generates drama scripts and makes the plot played by agents more controllable. The director agent writes plot outlines that the user desires to see, instructs the actor agents to role-play their characters, and reschedules the plot when human players participate in the scenario to ensure the plot is progressing towards the objective. To evaluate the framework, we create a novel drama plot that involves several actor agents and check the interactions between them under the instruction of the director agent. Evaluation results show that our framework could generate complete, diverse drama scripts from only a rough outline of plot objectives, meanwhile maintaining the characteristics of characters in the drama.

Analyzing Temporal Complex Events with Large Language Models? A Benchmark towards Temporal, Long Context Understanding	The digital landscape is rapidly evolving with an ever-increasing volume of online news, emphasizing the need for swift and precise analysis of complex events.We refer to the complex events composed of many news articles over an extended period as Temporal Complex Event (TCE). This paper proposes a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically extract and analyze the event chain within TCE, characterized by their key points and timestamps. We establish a benchmark, named TCELongBench, to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in handling temporal dynamics and understanding extensive text. This benchmark encompasses three distinct tasks - reading comprehension, temporal sequencing, and future event forecasting. In the experiment, we leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method and LLMs with long context window to deal with lengthy news articles of TCE. Our findings indicate that models with suitable retrievers exhibit comparable performance with those utilizing long context window.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.87	Zhihan Zhang, Yixin Cao, Chenchen Ye, Yunshan Ma, Lizi Liao, Tat-Seng Chua
Probing Language Models for Pre-training Data Detection	Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown their impressive capabilities, while also raising concerns about the data contamination problems due to privacy issues and leakage of benchmark datasets in the pre-training phase. Therefore, it is vital to detect the contamination by checking whether an LLM has been pre-trained on the target texts. Recent studies focus on the generated texts and compute perplexities, which are superficial features and not reliable. In this study, we propose to utilize the probing technique for pre-training data detection by examining the model's internal activations. Our method is simple and effective and leads to more trustworthy pre-training data detection. Additionally, we propose ArxivMIA, a new challenging benchmark comprising arxiv abstracts from Computer Science and Mathematics categories. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms all baselines, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both WikiMIA and ArxivMIA, with additional experiments confirming its efficacy.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.86	Zhenhua Liu, Tong Zhu, Chuanyuan Tan, Bing Liu, Haonan Lu, Wenliang Chen
A Non-autoregressive Generation Framework for End-to-End Simultaneous Speech-to-Any Translation	Simultaneous translation models play a crucial role in facilitating communication. However, existing research primarily focuses on text-to-text or speech-to-text models, necessitating additional cascade components to achieve speech-to-speech translation. These pipeline methods suffer from error propagation and accumulate delays in each cascade component, resulting in reduced synchronization between the speaker and listener. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel non-autoregressive generation framework for simultaneous speech translation (NAST-S2 x ), which integrates speech-to-text and speech-to-speech tasks into a unified end-to-end framework.We develop a non-autoregressive decoder capable of concurrently generating multiple text or acoustic unit tokens upon receiving fixed-length speech chunks. The decoder can generate blank or repeated tokens and employ CTC decoding to dynamically adjust its latency. Experimental results show that NAST-S2 x outperforms state-of-the-art models in both speech-to-text and speech-to-speech tasks. It achieves high-quality simultaneous interpretation within a delay of less than 3 seconds and provides a 28× decoding speedup in offline generation.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.85	Zhengrui Ma, Qingkai Fang, Shaolei Zhang, Shoutao Guo, Yang Feng, Min Zhang
Dependency Transformer Grammars: Integrating Dependency Structures into Transformer Language Models	Syntactic Transformer language models aim to achieve better generalization through simultaneously modeling syntax trees and sentences. While prior work has been focusing on adding constituency-based structures to Transformers, we introduce Dependency Transformer Grammars (DTGs), a new class of Transformer language model with explicit dependency-based inductive bias. DTGs simulate dependency transition systems with constrained attention patterns by modifying attention masks, incorporate the stack information through relative positional encoding, and augment dependency arc representation with a combination of token embeddings and operation embeddings. When trained on a dataset of sentences annotated with dependency trees, DTGs achieve better generalization while maintaining comparable perplexity with Transformer language model baselines. DTGs also outperform recent constituency-based models, showing that dependency can better guide Transformer language models. Our code is released at https://github.com/zhaoyd1/Dep_Transformer_Grammars.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.84	Yida Zhao, Chao Lou, Kewei Tu
WaterBench: Towards Holistic Evaluation of Watermarks for Large Language Models	To mitigate the potential misuse of large language models (LLMs), recent research has developed watermarking algorithms, which restrict the generation process to leave an invisible trace for watermark detection. Due to the two-stage nature of the task, most studies evaluate the generation and detection separately, thereby presenting a challenge in unbiased, thorough, and applicable evaluations. In this paper, we introduce WaterBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for LLM watermarks, in which we design three crucial factors: (1) For benchmarking procedure, to ensure an apples-to-apples comparison, we first adjust each watermarking method's hyper-parameter to reach the same watermarking strength, then jointly evaluate their generation and detection performance. (2) For task selection, we diversify the input and output length to form a five-category taxonomy, covering 9 tasks. (3) For evaluation metric, we adopt the GPT4-Judge for automatically evaluating the decline of instruction-following abilities after watermarking. We evaluate 4 open-source watermarks on 2 LLMs under 2 watermarking strengths and observe the common struggles for current methods on maintaining the generation quality. The code and data are available at https://github.com/THU-KEG/WaterBench.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.83	Shangqing Tu, Yuliang Sun, Yushi Bai, Jifan Yu, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li
Probing the Multi-turn Planning Capabilities of LLMs via 20 Question Games	Large language models (LLMs) are effective at answering questions that are clearly asked. However, when faced with ambiguous queries they can act unpredictably and produce incorrect outputs. This underscores the need for the development of intelligent agents capable of asking clarification questions to resolve ambiguities effectively. This capability requires complex understanding, state tracking, reasoning and planning over multiple conversational turns. However, directly measuring this can be challenging.In this paper, we offer a surrogate problem which assesses an LLMs's capability to deduce an entity unknown to itself, but revealed to a judge, by asking the judge a series of queries. This entity-deducing game can serve as an evaluation framework to probe the conversational reasoning and planning capabilities of language models.We systematically evaluate various LLMs and discover significant differences in their performance on this task. We find that strong LLMs like GPT-4 outperform human players by a large margin. We further employ Behavior Cloning (BC) to examine whether a weaker model is capable of imitating a stronger model and generalizing to data or domains, using only the demonstrations from a stronger model. We finally propose to use Reinforcement Learning to enhance reasoning and planning capacity of Vicuna models through episodes of game playing, which lead to significant performance improvement. We hope that this problem offers insights into how autonomous agents could be trained to behave more intelligently in ambiguous circumstances.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.82	Yizhe Zhang, Jiarui Lu, Navdeep Jaitly
Feature-Adaptive and Data-Scalable In-Context Learning	In-context learning (ICL), which promotes inference with several demonstrations, has become a widespread paradigm to stimulate LLM capabilities for downstream tasks. Due to context length constraints, it cannot be further improved in spite of more training data, and general features directly from LLMs in ICL are not adaptive to the specific downstream task. In this paper, we propose a feature-adaptive and data-scalable in-context learning framework (FADS-ICL), which can leverage task-adaptive features to promote inference on the downstream task, with the supervision of beyond-context samples.Specifically, it first extracts general features of beyond-context samples via the LLM with ICL input form one by one, and introduces a task-specific modulator to perform feature refinement and prediction after fitting a specific downstream task. We conduct extensive experiments on FADS-ICL under varying data settings (4~128 shots) and LLM scale (0.8~70B) settings. Experimental results show that FADS-ICL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin under all settings, verifying the effectiveness and superiority of FADS-ICL. For example, under the 1.5B and 32 shots setting, FADS-ICL can achieve +14.3 average accuracy from feature adaptation over vanilla ICL on 10 datasets, with +6.2 average accuracy over the previous state-of-the-art method, and the performance can further improve with increasing training data.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.81	Jiahao Li, Quan Wang, Licheng Zhang, Guoqing Jin, Zhendong Mao
Transitive Consistency Constrained Learning for Entity-to-Entity Stance Detection	Entity-to-entity stance detection identifies the stance between a pair of entities with a directed link that indicates the source, target and polarity. It is a streamlined task without the complex dependency structure for structural sentiment analysis, while it is more informative compared to most previous work assuming that the source is the author. Previous work performs entity-to-entity stance detection training on individual entity pairs. However, stances between inter-connected entity pairs may be correlated. In this paper, we propose transitive consistency constrained learning, which first finds connected entity pairs and their stances, and adds an additional objective to enforce the transitive consistency. We explore consistency training on both classification-based and generation-based models and conduct experiments to compare consistency training with previous work and large language models with in-context learning. Experimental results illustrate that the inter-correlation of stances in political news can be used to improve the entity-to-entity stance detection model, while overly strict consistency enforcement may have a negative impact. In addition, we find that large language models struggle with predicting link direction and neutral labels in this task.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.80	Haoyang Wen, Eduard Hovy, Alexander Hauptmann
Citation-Enhanced Generation for LLM-based Chatbots	Large language models (LLMs) exhibit powerful general intelligence across diverse scenarios, including their integration into chatbots. However, a vital challenge of LLM-based chatbots is that they may produce hallucinated content in responses, which significantly limits their applicability. Various efforts have been made to alleviate hallucination, such as retrieval augmented generation and reinforcement learning with human feedback, but most of them require additional training and data annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel post-hoc Citation-Enhanced Generation (CEG) approach combined with retrieval argumentation. Unlike previous studies that focus on preventing hallucinations during generation, our method addresses this issue in a post-hoc way. It incorporates a retrieval module to search for supporting documents relevant to the generated content, and employs a natural language inference-based citation generation module. Once the statements in the generated content lack of reference, our model can regenerate responses until all statements are supported by citations. Note that our method is a training-free plug-and-play plugin that is capable of various LLMs. Experiments on various hallucination-related datasets show our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both hallucination detection and response regeneration on three benchmarks.

Enhancing Large Language Models in Coding Through Multi-Perspective Self-Consistency	Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable ability in code generation. However, generating the correct solution in a single attempt still remains a challenge. Prior works utilize verification properties in software engineering to verify and re-rank solutions in a majority voting manner. But the assumption behind them that generated verification properties have better qualities than solutions may not always hold. In this paper, we treat them equally as different perspectives of LLMs' reasoning processes. We propose the Multi-Perspective Self-Consistency (MPSC) framework incorporating both inter- and intra-consistency across outputs from multiple perspectives. Specifically, we prompt LLMs to generate diverse outputs from three perspectives, Solution, Specification and Test case, constructing a 3-partite graph. With two measure functions of consistency, we embed both inter- and intra-consistency information into the graph. The optimal choice of solutions is then determined based on analysis in the graph.MPSC significantly boosts performance of foundation models (ChatGPT in this paper) on various benchmarks, including HumanEval (+15.91%), MBPP (+6.43%) and CodeContests (+9.37%), even surpassing GPT-4.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.78	Baizhou Huang, Shuai Lu, Xiaojun Wan, Nan Duan
Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Large Language Models with Self-Synthesized Rehearsal	Large language models (LLMs) suffer from catastrophic forgetting during continual learning. Conventional rehearsal-based methods rely on previous training data to retain the model's ability, which may not be feasible in real-world applications. When conducting continual learning based on a publicly-released LLM checkpoint, the availability of the original training data may be non-existent. To address this challenge, we propose a framework called Self-Synthesized Rehearsal (SSR) that uses the LLM to generate synthetic instances for rehearsal. Concretely, we first employ the base LLM for in-context learning to generate synthetic instances. Subsequently, we utilize the latest LLM to refine the instance outputs based on the synthetic inputs, preserving its acquired ability. Finally, we select diverse high-quality synthetic instances for rehearsal in future stages. Experimental results demonstrate that SSR achieves superior or comparable performance compared to conventional rehearsal-based approaches while being more data-efficient. Besides, SSR effectively preserves the generalization capabilities of LLMs in general domains.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.77	Jianheng Huang, Leyang Cui, Ante Wang, Chengyi Yang, Xinting Liao, Linfeng Song, Junfeng Yao, Jinsong Su
A Multidimensional Framework for Evaluating Lexical Semantic Change with Social Science Applications	Historical linguists have identified multiple forms of lexical semantic change. We present a three-dimensional framework for integrating these forms and a unified computational methodology for evaluating them concurrently. The dimensions represent increases or decreases in semantic 1) sentiment (valence of a target word's collocates), 2) intensity (emotional arousal of collocates or the frequency of intensifiers), and 3) breadth (diversity of contexts in which the target word appears). These dimensions can be complemented by evaluation of shifts in the frequency of the target words and the thematic content of its collocates. This framework enables lexical semantic change to be mapped economically and systematically and has applications in computational social science. We present an illustrative analysis of semantic shifts in mental health and mental illness in two corpora, demonstrating patterns of semantic change that illuminate contemporary concerns about pathologization, stigma, and concept creep.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.76	Naomi Baes, Nick Haslam, Ekaterina Vylomova
Rewriting the Code: A Simple Method for Large Language Model Augmented Code Search	In code search, the Generation-Augmented Retrieval (GAR) framework, which generates exemplar code snippets to augment queries, has emerged as a promising strategy to address the principal challenge of modality misalignment between code snippets and natural language queries, particularly with the demonstrated code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nevertheless, our preliminary investigations indicate that the improvements conferred by such an LLM-augmented framework are somewhat constrained. This limitation could potentially be ascribed to the fact that the generated codes, albeit functionally accurate, frequently display a pronounced stylistic deviation from the ground truth code in the codebase. In this paper, we extend the foundational GAR framework and propose a simple yet effective method that additionally Rewrites the Code (ReCo) within the codebase for style normalization. Experimental results demonstrate that ReCo significantly boosts retrieval accuracy across sparse (up to 35.7%), zero-shot dense (up to 27.6%), and fine-tuned dense (up to 23.6%) retrieval settings in diverse search scenarios. To further elucidate the advantages of ReCo and stimulate research in code style normalization, we introduce Code Style Similarity, the first metric tailored to quantify stylistic similarities in code. Notably, our empirical findings reveal the inadequacy of existing metrics in capturing stylistic nuances.

EasyGen: Easing Multimodal Generation with BiDiffuser and LLMs	We present EasyGen, an efficient model designed to enhance multimodal understanding and generation by harnessing the capabilities of diffusion models and large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing multimodal models that predominately depend on encoders like CLIP or ImageBind and need ample amounts of training data to bridge modalities, EasyGen leverages BiDiffuser, a bidirectional conditional diffusion model, to foster more efficient modality interactions. EasyGen achieves text generation by training a projection layer linking BiDiffuser and an LLM, and facilities image generation by training an adapter to align the LLM's text space with the BiDiffuser's image space. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that EasyGen excels in data-efficient training, high-quality image generation, and extendibility, effectively addressing the challenges in multimodal generation.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.74	Xiangyu Zhao, Bo Liu, Qijiong Liu, Guangyuan Shi, Xiao-Ming Wu
Active Prompting with Chain-of-Thought for Large Language Models	The increasing scale of large language models (LLMs) brings emergent abilities to various complex tasks requiring reasoning, such as arithmetic and commonsense reasoning. It is known that the effective design of task-specific prompts is critical for LLMs' ability to produce high-quality answers. In particular, an effective approach for complex question-and-answering tasks is example-based prompting with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which significantly improves the performance of LLMs. However, current CoT methods rely on a fixed set of human-annotated exemplars, which are not necessarily the most effective examples for different tasks. This paper proposes a new method, Active-Prompt, to adapt LLMs to different tasks with task-specific example prompts (annotated with human-designed CoT reasoning). For this purpose, we propose a solution to the key problem of determining which questions are the most important and helpful to annotate from a pool of task-specific queries. By borrowing ideas from the related problem of uncertainty-based active learning, we introduce several metrics to characterize the uncertainty so as to select the most uncertain questions for annotation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, achieving superior performance on eight complex reasoning tasks. Further analyses of different uncertainty metrics, pool sizes, zero-shot learning, and accuracy-uncertainty relationships demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.73	Shizhe Diao, Pengcheng Wang, Yong Lin, Rui Pan, Xiang Liu, Tong Zhang
Advancing Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge Graphs through Complex Logical Hypothesis Generation	Abductive reasoning is the process of making educated guesses to provide explanations for observations. Although many applications require the use of knowledge for explanations, the utilization of abductive reasoning in conjunction with structured knowledge, such as a knowledge graph, remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, this paper introduces the task of complex logical hypothesis generation, as an initial step towards abductive logical reasoning with KG. In this task, we aim to generate a complex logical hypothesis so that it can explain a set of observations. We find that the supervised trained generative model can generate logical hypotheses that are structurally closer to the reference hypothesis. However, when generalized to unseen observations, this training objective does not guarantee better hypothesis generation. To address this, we introduce the Reinforcement Learning from Knowledge Graph (RLF-KG) method, which minimizes differences between observations and conclusions drawn from generated hypotheses according to the KG. Experiments show that, with RLF-KG's assistance, the generated hypotheses provide better explanations, and achieve state-of-the-art results on three widely used KGs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.72	Jiaxin Bai, Yicheng Wang, Tianshi Zheng, Yue Guo, Xin Liu, Yangqiu Song
Grounding Language Model with Chunking-Free In-Context Retrieval	This paper presents a novel Chunking-Free In-Context (CFIC) retrieval approach, specifically tailored for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Traditional RAG systems often struggle with grounding responses using precise evidence text due to the challenges of processing lengthy documents and filtering out irrelevant content. Commonly employed solutions, such as document chunking and adapting language models to handle longer contexts, have their limitations. These methods either disrupt the semantic coherence of the text or fail to effectively address the issues of noise and inaccuracy in evidence retrieval.The CFIC approach addresses these challenges by circumventing the conventional chunking process. It utilizes the encoded hidden states of documents for in-context retrieval, employing auto-aggressive decoding to accurately identify the specific evidence text required for user queries, eliminating the need for chunking. CFIC is further enhanced by incorporating two innovative decoding strategies, namely Constrained Sentence Prefix Decoding and Skip Decoding. These strategies not only improve the efficiency of the retrieval process but also ensure that the fidelity of the generated grounding text evidence is maintained.Our evaluations of CFIC on a range of open question answering datasets demonstrate its superiority in retrieving relevant and accurate information, offering a significant improvement over traditional methods. By doing away with the need for document chunking, CFIC presents a more streamlined, effective, and efficient retrieval solution, making it a valuable advancement in the field of RAG systems.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.71	Hongjin Qian, Zheng Liu, Kelong Mao, Yujia Zhou, Zhicheng Dou
DeepSeekMoE: Towards Ultimate Expert Specialization in Mixture-of-Experts Language Models	In the era of large language models, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a promising architecture for managing computational costs when scaling up model parameters. However, conventional MoE architectures like GShard, which activate the top- K out of N experts, face challenges in ensuring expert specialization, i.e. each expert acquires non-overlapping and focused knowledge. In response, we propose the DeepSeekMoE architecture towards ultimate expert specialization. It involves two principal strategies: (1) finely segmenting the experts into mN ones and activating mK from them, allowing for a more flexible combination of activated experts; (2) isolating Ks experts as shared ones, aiming at capturing common knowledge and mitigating redundancy in routed experts. Starting from a modest scale with 2B parameters, we demonstrate that DeepSeekMoE 2B achieves comparable performance with GShard 2.9B, which has 1.5 × expert parameters and computation. In addition, DeepSeekMoE 2B nearly approaches the performance of its dense counterpart with the same number of total parameters, which sets the upper bound of MoE models. Subsequently, we scale up DeepSeekMoE to 16B parameters and show that it achieves comparable performance with DeepSeek 7B and LLaMA2 7B, with only about 40% of computations.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.70	Damai Dai, Chengqi Deng, Chenggang Zhao, R.x.

TaSL: Continual Dialog State Tracking via Task Skill Localization and Consolidation	A practical dialogue system requires the capacity for ongoing skill acquisition and adaptability to new tasks while preserving prior knowledge. However, current methods for Continual Dialogue State Tracking (DST), a crucial function of dialogue systems, struggle with the catastrophic forgetting issue and knowledge transfer between tasks. We present TaSL, a novel framework for task skill localization and consolidation that enables effective knowledge transfer without relying on memory replay. TaSL uses a novel group-wise technique to pinpoint task-specific and task-shared areas. Additionally, a fine-grained skill consolidation strategy protects task-specific knowledge from being forgotten while updating shared knowledge for bi-directional knowledge transfer. As a result, TaSL strikes a balance between preserving previous knowledge and excelling at new tasks. Comprehensive experiments on various backbones highlight the significant performance improvements of TaSL, with a 7.6% absolute increase in Avg. JGA and an 11% absolute rise in BWT metrics over existing state-of-the-art methods.

ANALOGYKB: Unlocking Analogical Reasoning of Language Models with A Million-scale Knowledge Base	Analogical reasoning is a fundamental cognitive ability of humans. However, current language models (LMs) still struggle to achieve human-like performance in analogical reasoning tasks due to a lack of resources for model training. In this work, we address this gap by proposing ANALOGYKB, a million-scale analogy knowledge base (KB) derived from existing knowledge graphs (KGs). ANALOGYKB identifies two types of analogies from the KGs: 1) analogies of the same relations, which can be directly extracted from the KGs, and 2) analogies of analogous relations, which are identified with a selection and filtering pipeline enabled by large language models (LLMs), followed by minor human efforts for data quality control. Evaluations on a series of datasets of two analogical reasoning tasks (analogy recognition and generation) demonstrate that ANALOGYKB successfully enables both smaller LMs and LLMs to gain better analogical reasoning capabilities.

BeamAggR: Beam Aggregation Reasoning over Multi-source Knowledge for Multi-hop Question Answering	Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities.Nevertheless, they still suffer from factual errors when tackling knowledge-intensive tasks.Retrieval-augmented reasoning represents a promising approach.However, significant challenges still persist, including inaccurate and insufficient retrieval for complex questions, as well as difficulty in integrating multi-source knowledge.To address this, we propose Beam Aggregation Reasoning (BeamAggR), a reasoning framework for knowledge-intensive multi-hop QA.BeamAggR explores and prioritizes promising answers at each hop of question.Concretely, we parse the complex questions into trees, which include atom and composite questions, followed by bottom-up reasoning.For atomic questions, the LLM conducts reasoning on multi-source knowledge to get answer candidates.For composite questions, the LLM combines beam candidates, explores multiple reasoning paths through probabilistic aggregation, and prioritizes the most promising trajectory.Extensive experiments on four open-domain multi-hop reasoning datasets show that our method significantly outperforms SOTA methods by 8.5%.Furthermore, our analysis reveals that BeamAggR elicits better knowledge collaboration and answer aggregation.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.67	Zheng Chu, Jingchang Chen, Qianglong Chen, Haotian Wang, Kun Zhu, Xiyuan Du, Weijiang Yu, Ming Liu, Bing Qin
TimeBench: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Temporal Reasoning Abilities in Large Language Models	Grasping the concept of time is a fundamental facet of human cognition, indispensable for truly comprehending the intricacies of the world.Previous studies typically focus on specific aspects of time, lacking a comprehensive temporal reasoning benchmark.To address this, we propose TimeBench, a comprehensive hierarchical temporal reasoning benchmark that covers a broad spectrum of temporal reasoning phenomena.TimeBench provides a thorough evaluation for investigating the temporal reasoning capabilities of large language models.We conduct extensive experiments on GPT-4, LLaMA2, and other popular LLMs under various settings.Our experimental results indicate a significant performance gap between the state-of-the-art LLMs and humans, highlighting that there is still a considerable distance to cover in temporal reasoning.Besides, LLMs exhibit capability discrepancies across different reasoning categories.Furthermore, we thoroughly analyze the impact of multiple aspects on temporal reasoning and emphasize the associated challenges.We aspire for TimeBench to serve as a comprehensive benchmark, fostering research in temporal reasoning.Code and data are available at https://github.com/zchuz/TimeBench.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.66	Zheng Chu, Jingchang Chen, Qianglong Chen, Weijiang Yu, Haotian Wang, Ming Liu, Bing Qin

Linguistically Conditioned Semantic Textual Similarity	Semantic textual similarity (STS) is a fundamental NLP task that measures the semantic similarity between a pair of sentences. In order to reduce the inherent ambiguity posed from the sentences, a recent work called Conditional STS (C-STS) has been proposed to measure the sentences' similarity conditioned on a certain aspect. Despite the popularity of C-STS, we find that the current C-STS dataset suffers from various issues that could impede proper evaluation on this task. In this paper, we reannotate the C-STS validation set and observe an annotator discrepancy on 55% of the instances resulting from the annotation errors in the original label, ill-defined conditions, and the lack of clarity in the task definition. After a thorough dataset analysis, we improve the C-STS task by leveraging the models' capability to understand the conditions under a QA task setting. With the generated answers, we present an automatic error identification pipeline that is able to identify annotation errors from the C-STS data with over 80% F1 score. We also propose a new method that largely improves the performance over baselines on the C-STS data by training the models with the answers. Finally we discuss the conditionality annotation based on the typed-feature structure (TFS) of entity types. We show in examples that the TFS is able to provide a linguistic foundation for constructing C-STS data with new conditions.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.64	Jingxuan Tu, Keer Xu, Liulu Yue, Bingyang Ye, Kyeongmin Rim, James Pustejovsky
ConSiDERS-The-Human Evaluation Framework: Rethinking Human Evaluation for Generative Large Language Models	In this position paper, we argue that human evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs) should be a multidisciplinary undertaking that draws upon the insights from disciplines such as user experience research and human behavioral psychology to ensure that the experimental design and results are reliable. The conclusions from these evaluations, therefore, must consider factors such as usability, aesthetics and cognitive biases. We highlight how cognitive biases can conflate fluent information and truthfulness, and how cognitive uncertainty affects the reliability of rating scores such as Likert. Furthermore, the evaluation should differentiate the capabilities and weaknesses of increasingly powerful large language models - which requires effective test sets. Scalability of human evaluation is also crucial to wider adoption. Hence, to design an effective human evaluation system in the age of generative NLP we propose the ConSiDERS-The-Human evaluation framework consisting of 6 pillars - Consistency, Scoring Criteria, Differentiating, User Experience, Responsible, and Scalability.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.63	Aparna Elangovan, Ling Liu, Lei Xu, Sravan Babu Bodapati, Dan Roth
InstructProtein: Aligning Human and Protein Language via Knowledge Instruction	Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, but they fall short in comprehending biological sequences such as proteins. To address this challenge, we propose InstructProtein, an innovative LLM that possesses bidirectional generation capabilities in both human and protein languages: (i) taking a protein sequence as input to predict its textual function description and (ii) using natural language to prompt protein sequence generation. To achieve this, we first pre-train an LLM on both protein and natural language corpora, enabling it to comprehend individual languages. Then supervised instruction tuning is employed to facilitate the alignment of these two distinct languages. Herein, we introduce a knowledge graph-based instruction generation framework to construct a high-quality instruction dataset, addressing the annotation imbalance and the absence of instructional signals in the existing protein-text corpus. In particular, the instructions inherit the structural relations between proteins and function annotations in knowledge graphs, which empowers our model to engage in the causal modeling of protein functions, akin to the chain-of-thought processes in natural languages. Extensive experiments on bidirectional protein-text generation tasks show that InstructProtein outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs by a large margin.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.62	Zeyuan Wang, Qiang Zhang, Keyan Ding, Ming Qin, Xiang Zhuang, Xiaotong Li, Huajun Chen
Tell Me More! Towards Implicit User Intention Understanding of Language Model Driven Agents	Current language model-driven agents often lack mechanisms for effective user participation, which is crucial given the vagueness commonly found in user instructions. Although adept at devising strategies and performing tasks, these agents struggle with seeking clarification and grasping precise user intentions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Intention-in-Interaction (IN3), a novel benchmark designed to inspect users' implicit intentions through explicit queries. Next, we propose the incorporation of model experts as the upstream in agent designs to enhance user-agent interaction. Employing IN3, we empirically train Mistral-Interact, a powerful model that proactively assesses task vagueness, inquires about user intentions, and refines them into actionable goals before starting downstream agent task execution. Integrating it into the XAgent framework, we comprehensively evaluate the enhanced agent system regarding user instruction understanding and execution, revealing that our approach notably excels at identifying vague user tasks, recovering and summarizing critical missing information, setting precise and necessary agent execution goals, and minimizing redundant tool usage, thus boosting overall efficiency.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.61	Cheng Qian, Bingxiang He, Zhong Zhuang, Jia Deng, Yujia Qin, Xin Cong, Zhong Zhang, Jie Zhou, Yankai Lin, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun
RORA: Robust Free-Text Rationale Evaluation	Free-text rationales play a pivotal role in explainable NLP, bridging the knowledge and reasoning gaps behind a model's decision-making. However, due to the diversity of potential reasoning paths and a corresponding lack of definitive ground truth, their evaluation remains a challenge. Existing metrics rely on the degree to which a rationale supports a target label, but we find these fall short in evaluating rationales that inadvertently leak the label. To address this problem, we propose RORA, a RObust free-text RAtionale evaluation against label leakage. RORA quantifies the new information supplied by a rationale to justify the label. This is achieved by assessing the conditional 𝒱 -information (Hewitt et al., 2021) with a predictive family robust against leaky features that can be exploited by a small model. RORA consistently outperforms existing approaches in evaluating human-written, synthetic, or model-generated rationales, particularly demonstrating robustness against label leakage. We also show that RORA aligns well with human judgment, providing a more reliable and accurate measurement across diverse free-text rationales.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.60	Zhengping Jiang, Yining Lu, Hanjie Chen, Daniel Khashabi, Benjamin Van Durme, Anqi Liu
An Information Bottleneck Perspective for Effective Noise Filtering on Retrieval-Augmented Generation	Retrieval-augmented generation integrates the capabilities of large language models with relevant information retrieved from an extensive corpus, yet encounters challenges when confronted with real-world noisy data. One recent solution is to train a filter module to find relevant content but only achieve suboptimal noise compression. In this paper, we propose to introduce the information bottleneck theory into retrieval-augmented generation. Our approach involves the filtration of noise by simultaneously maximizing the mutual information between compression and ground output, while minimizing the mutual information between compression and retrieved passage. In addition, we derive the formula of information bottleneck to facilitate its application in novel comprehensive evaluations, the selection of supervised fine-tuning data, and the construction of reinforcement learning rewards. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements across various question answering datasets, not only in terms of the correctness of answer generation but also in the conciseness with 2.5% compression rate.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.59	Kun Zhu, Xiaocheng Feng, Xiyuan Du, Yuxuan Gu, Weijiang Yu, Haotian Wang, Qianglong Chen, Zheng Chu, Jingchang Chen, Bing Qin
Self-Distillation Bridges Distribution Gap in Language Model Fine-Tuning	The surge in Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, but fine-tuning them for specific tasks often encounters challenges in balancing performance and preserving general instruction-following abilities. In this paper, we posit that the distribution gap between task datasets and the LLMs serves as the primary underlying cause. To address the problem, we introduce Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), a novel approach that bridges the distribution gap by guiding fine-tuning with a distilled dataset generated by the model itself to match its original distribution. Experimental results on the Llama-2-chat model across various benchmarks demonstrate that SDFT effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while achieving comparable or superior performance on downstream tasks compared to the vanilla fine-tuning. Moreover, SDFT demonstrates the potential to maintain the helpfulness and safety alignment of LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/sdft.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.58	Zhaorui Yang, Tianyu Pang, Haozhe Feng, Han Wang, Wei Chen, Minfeng Zhu, Qian Liu
Can ChatGPT’s Performance be Improved on Verb Metaphor Detection Tasks? Bootstrapping and Combining Tacit Knowledge	Metaphors detection, as an important task in the field of NLP, has been receiving sustained academic attention in recent years. Current researches focus supervised metaphors detection systems, which usually require large-scale, high-quality labeled data support. The emerge of large language models (e.g., ChatGPT) has made many NLP tasks (e.g., automatic summarization and dialogue systems) a qualitative leap. However, it is worth noting that the use of ChatGPT for unsupervised metaphors detection is often challenged with less-than-expected performance. Therefore, the aim of our work is to explore how to bootstrap and combine ChatGPT by detecting the most prevalent verb metaphors among metaphors. Our approach first utilizes ChatGPT to obtain literal collocations of target verbs and subject-object pairs of verbs in the text to be detected. Subsequently, these literal collocations and subject-object pairs are mapped to the same set of topics, and finally the verb metaphors are detected through the analysis of entailment relations. The experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance on the unsupervised verb metaphors detection task compared to existing unsupervised methods or direct prediction using ChatGPT.

Reflect-RL: Two-Player Online RL Fine-Tuning for LMs	As language models (LMs) demonstrate their capabilities in various fields, their application to tasks requiring multi-round interactions has become increasingly popular. These tasks usually have complex dynamics, so supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a limited offline dataset does not yield good performance. However, only a few works attempted to directly train the LMs within interactive decision-making environments. We aim to create an effective approach to fine-tune LMs with online reinforcement learning (RL) in these environments. We propose Reflect-RL, a two-player system to fine-tune an LM using SFT and online RL, where a frozen reflection model (player) assists the policy model (player). To generate data for the warm-up SFT stage, we use negative example generation to enhance the error-correction ability of the reflection model. Furthermore, we designed single-prompt action enumeration and applied curriculum learning to allow the policy model to learn more efficiently. Empirically, we verify that Reflect-RL outperforms SFT and online RL without reflection. Testing results indicate GPT-2 XL 1.56B fine-tuned with Reflect-RL outperforms larger open-source LMs, such as Mistral 7B.

AbsInstruct: Eliciting Abstraction Ability from LLMs through Explanation Tuning with Plausibility Estimation	Abstraction ability is crucial in human intelligence, which can also benefit various tasks in NLP study. Existing work shows that LLMs are deficient in abstract ability, and how to improve it remains unexplored. In this work, we design the framework AbsInstruct to enhance LLMs' abstraction ability through instruction tuning. The framework builds instructions with in-depth explanations to assist LLMs in capturing the underlying rationale of abstraction. Meanwhile, we introduce a plausibility estimator to select instructions that are more consistent with the abstraction knowledge of LLMs to be aligned. Then, our framework combines abstraction instructions with general-purpose ones to build a hybrid dataset. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that our framework can considerably enhance LLMs' abstraction ability with strong generalization performance while maintaining their general instruction-following abilities.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.55	Zhaowei Wang, Wei Fan, Qing Zong, Hongming Zhang, Sehyun Choi, Tianqing Fang, Xin Liu, Yangqiu Song, Ginny Wong, Simon See

To tackle these challenges, we standardize the task of ATG and propose a first benchmark dataset, CAMERA, carefully designed and enabling the utilization of multi-modal information and facilitating industry-wise evaluations. Our extensive experiments with a variety of nine baselines, from classical methods to state-of-the-art models including large language models (LLMs), show the current state and the remaining challenges.

Prompt Refinement with Image Pivot for Text-to-Image Generation	"For text-to-image generation, automatically refining user-provided natural language prompts into the keyword-enriched prompts favored by systems is essential for the user experience. Such a prompt refinement process is analogous to translating the prompt from ""user languages"" into ""system languages"". However, the scarcity of such parallel corpora makes it difficult to train a prompt refinement model. Inspired by zero-shot machine translation techniques, we introduce Prompt Refinement with Image Pivot (PRIP). PRIP innovatively uses the latent representation of a user-preferred image as an intermediary ""pivot"" between the user and system languages. It decomposes the refinement process into two data-rich tasks: inferring representations of user-preferred images from user languages and subsequently translating image representations into system languages. Thus, it can leverage abundant data for training. Extensive experiments show that PRIP substantially outperforms a wide range of baselines and effectively transfers to unseen systems in a zero-shot manner."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.53	Jingtao Zhan, Qingyao Ai, Yiqun Liu, Yingwei Pan, Ting Yao, Jiaxin Mao, Shaoping Ma, Tao Mei
FineSurE: Fine-grained Summarization Evaluation using LLMs	Automated evaluation is crucial for streamlining text summarization benchmarking and model development, given the costly and time-consuming nature of human evaluation. Traditional methods like ROUGE do not correlate well with human judgment, while recently proposed LLM-based metrics provide only summary-level assessment using Likert-scale scores. This limits deeper model analysis, e.g., we can only assign one hallucination score at the summary level, while at the sentence level, we can count sentences containing hallucinations. To remedy those limitations, we propose FineSurE, a fine-grained evaluator specifically tailored for the summarization task using large language models (LLMs). It also employs completeness and conciseness criteria, in addition to faithfulness, enabling multi-dimensional assessment. We compare various open-source and proprietary LLMs as backbones for FineSurE. In addition, we conduct extensive benchmarking of FineSurE against SOTA methods including NLI-, QA-, and LLM-based methods, showing improved performance especially on the completeness and conciseness dimensions.

Tuning Large Multimodal Models for Videos using Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback	Recent advancements in large language models have influenced the development of video large multimodal models (VLMMs). Previous approaches for VLMMs involve Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with instruction-tuned datasets, integrating LLM with visual encoders, and additional learnable parameters. Here, aligning video with text, and vice versa, remains a challenge, primarily due to the insufficient quality and quantity of multimodal instruction-tune data compared to that of text-only. This discrepancy often results in alignments that poorly ground the video content. To address this, we present a novel alignment strategy that employs a multimodal AI system equipped with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF), providing self-preference feedback to refine itself and facilitating the alignment of video and text modalities. Our approach uniquely integrates detailed video descriptions as context into a multimodal AI system during the preference feedback generation to enrich the understanding of video content, a process we call context-aware reward modeling. Empirical evaluations on various video benchmarks demonstrate that our VLM-RLAIF outperforms existing approaches, including the SFT model. We commit to open-sourcing our code, models, and datasets to foster further research in this area.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.52	Daechul Ahn, Yura Choi, Youngjae Yu, Dongyeop Kang, Jonghyun Choi
VisualWebArena: Evaluating Multimodal Agents on Realistic Visual Web Tasks	Autonomous agents capable of planning, reasoning, and executing actions on the web offer a promising avenue for automating computer tasks. However, the majority of existing benchmarks primarily focus on text-based agents, neglecting many natural tasks that require visual information to effectively solve. Given that most computer interfaces cater to human perception, visual information often augments textual data in ways that text-only models struggle to harness effectively. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisualWebArena, a benchmark designed to assess the performance of multimodal web agents on *realistic visually grounded tasks*. VisualWebArena comprises of a set of diverse and complex web-based tasks that evaluate various capabilities of autonomous multimodal agents. To perform on this benchmark, agents need to accurately process image-text inputs, interpret natural language instructions, and execute actions on websites to accomplish user-defined objectives. We conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM-based autonomous agents, including several multimodal models. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, we identify several limitations of text-only LLM agents, and reveal gaps in the capabilities of state-of-the-art multimodal language agents. VisualWebArena provides a framework for evaluating multimodal autonomous language agents, and offers insights towards building stronger autonomous agents for the web.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.50	Jing Yu Koh, Robert Lo, Lawrence Jang, Vikram Duvvur, Ming Lim, Po-Yu Huang, Graham Neubig, Shuyan Zhou, Russ Salakhutdinov, Daniel Fried
Tree-of-Counterfactual Prompting for Zero-Shot Stance Detection	"Stance detection enables the inference of attitudes from human communications. Automatic stance identification was mostly cast as a classification problem. However, stance decisions involve complex judgments, which can be nowadays generated by prompting Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper we present a new method for stance identification which (1) relies on a new prompting framework, called Tree-of-Counterfactual prompting; (2) operates not only on textual communications, but also on images; (3) allows more than one stance object type; and (4) requires no examples of stance attribution, thus it is a ""Tabula Rasa"" Zero-Shot Stance Detection (TR-ZSSD) method. Our experiments indicate surprisingly promising results, outperforming fine-tuned stance detection systems."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.49	Maxwell Weinzierl, Sanda Harabagiu
Token-wise Influential Training Data Retrieval for Large Language Models	Given a Large Language Model (LLM) generation, how can we identify which training data led to this generation? In this paper, we proposed RapidIn, a scalable framework adapting to LLMs for estimating the influence of each training data. The proposed framework consists of two stages: caching and retrieval. First, we compress the gradient vectors by over 200,000x, allowing them to be cached on disk or in GPU/CPU memory. Then, given a generation, RapidIn efficiently traverses the cached gradients to estimate the influence within minutes, achieving over a 6,326x speedup. Moreover, RapidIn supports multi-GPU parallelization to substantially accelerate caching and retrieval. Our empirical result confirms the efficiency and effectiveness of RapidIn.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.48	Huawei Lin, Jikai Long, Zhaozhuo Xu, Weijie Zhao
IMBUE: Improving Interpersonal Effectiveness through Simulation and Just-in-time Feedback with Human-Language Model Interaction	Navigating certain communication situations can be challenging due to individuals' lack of skills and the interference of strong emotions. However, effective learning opportunities are rarely accessible. In this work, we conduct a human-centered study that uses language models to simulate bespoke communication training and provide just-in-time feedback to support the practice and learning of interpersonal effectiveness skills. We apply the interpersonal effectiveness framework from Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), DEAR MAN, which focuses on both conversational and emotional skills. We present IMBUE, an interactive training system that provides feedback 28% more similar to experts' feedback, compared to that generated by GPT-4. IMBUE is the first to focus on communication skills and emotion management simultaneously, incorporate experts' domain knowledge in providing feedback, and be grounded in psychology theory. Through a randomized trial of 86 participants, we find that IMBUE's simulation-only variant significantly improves participants' self-efficacy (up to 17%) and reduces negative emotions (up to 25%). With IMBUE's additional just-in-time feedback, participants demonstrate 17% improvement in skill mastery, along with greater enhancements in self-efficacy (27% more) and reduction of negative emotions (16% more) compared to simulation-only. The improvement in skill mastery is the only measure that is transferred to new and more difficult situations; situation-specific training is necessary for improving self-efficacy and emotion reduction.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.47	Inna Lin, Ashish Sharma, Christopher Rytting, Adam Miner, Jina Suh, Tim Althoff
Interactive Text-to-Image Retrieval with Large Language Models: A Plug-and-Play Approach	In this paper, we primarily address the issue of dialogue-form context query within the interactive text-to-image retrieval task. Our methodology, PlugIR, actively utilizes the general instruction-following capability of LLMs in two ways. First, by reformulating the dialogue-form context, we eliminate the necessity of fine-tuning a retrieval model on existing visual dialogue data, thereby enabling the use of any arbitrary black-box model. Second, we construct the LLM questioner to generate non-redundant questions about the attributes of the target image, based on the information of retrieval candidate images in the current context. This approach mitigates the issues of noisiness and redundancy in the generated questions. Beyond our methodology, we propose a novel evaluation metric, Best log Rank Integral (BRI), for a comprehensive assessment of the interactive retrieval system. PlugIR demonstrates superior performance compared to both zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines in various benchmarks. Additionally, the two methodologies comprising PlugIR can be flexibly applied together or separately in various situations.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.46	Saehyung Lee, Sangwon Yu, Junsung Park, Jihun Yi, Sungroh Yoon
Learn from Failure: Fine-tuning LLMs with Trial-and-Error Data for Intuitionistic Propositional Logic Proving	Recent advances in Automated Theorem Proving have shown the effectiveness of leveraging a (large) language model that generates tactics (i.e. proof steps) to search through proof states. The current model, while trained solely on successful proof paths, faces a discrepancy at the inference stage, as it must sample and try various tactics at each proof state until finding success, unlike its training which does not incorporate learning from failed attempts. Intuitively, a tactic that leads to a failed search path would indicate that similar tactics should receive less attention during the following trials. In this paper, we demonstrate the benefit of training models that additionally learn from failed search paths. Facing the lack of such trial-and-error data in existing open-source theorem-proving datasets, we curate a dataset on intuitionistic propositional logic theorems and formalize it in Lean, such that we can reliably check the correctness of proofs. We compare our model trained on relatively short trial-and-error information (TrialMaster) with models trained only on the correct paths and discover that the former solves more unseen theorems with lower trial searches.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.45	Chenyang An, Zhibo Chen, Qihao Ye, Emily First, Letian Peng, Jiayun Zhang, Zihan Wang, Sorin Lerner, Jingbo Shang
The Belebele Benchmark: a Parallel Reading Comprehension Dataset in 122 Language Variants	We present Belebele, a multiple-choice machine reading comprehension (MRC) dataset spanning 122 language variants. Significantly expanding the language coverage of natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks, this dataset enables the evaluation of text models in high-, medium-, and low-resource languages. Each question is based on a short passage from the FLORES-200 dataset and has four multiple-choice answers. The questions were carefully curated to discriminate between models with different levels of general language comprehension. The English dataset on its own proves difficult enough to challenge state-of-the-art language models. Being fully parallel, this dataset enables direct comparison of model performance across all languages. We use this dataset to evaluate the capabilities of multilingual masked language models (MLMs) and large language models (LLMs). We present extensive results and findings, notably that despite significant cross-lingual transfer in English-centric LLMs, much smaller MLMs pretrained on balanced multilingual data still understand far more languages. Overall, Belebele opens up new avenues for evaluating and analyzing the multilingual capabilities of NLP systems.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.44	Lucas Bandarkar, Davis Liang, Benjamin Muller, Mikel Artetxe, Satya Narayan Shukla, Donald Husa, Naman Goyal, Abhinandan Krishnan, Luke Zettlemoyer, Madian Khabsa
ABEX: Data Augmentation for Low-Resource NLU via Expanding Abstract Descriptions	We present ABEX, a novel and effective generative data augmentation methodology for low-resource Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. ABEX is based on ABstract-and-EXpand, a novel paradigm for generating diverse forms of an input document – we first convert a document into its concise, abstract description and then generate new documents based on expanding the resultant abstraction. To learn the task of expanding abstract descriptions, we first train BART on a large-scale synthetic dataset with abstract-document pairs. Next, to generate abstract descriptions for a document, we propose a simple, controllable, and training-free method based on editing AMR graphs. ABEX brings the best of both worlds: by expanding from abstract representations, it preserves the original semantic properties of the documents, like style and meaning, thereby maintaining alignment with the original label and data distribution. At the same time, the fundamental process of elaborating on abstract descriptions facilitates diverse generations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ABEX on 4 NLU tasks spanning 12 datasets and 4 low-resource settings. ABEX outperforms all our baselines qualitatively with improvements of 0.04% - 38.8%. Qualitatively, ABEX outperforms all prior methods from literature in terms of context and length diversity.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.43	Sreyan Ghosh, Utkarsh Tyagi, Sonal Kumar, Chandra Kiran Evuru, Ramaneswaran S, S Sakshi, Dinesh Manocha
Analysis of Multi-Source Language Training in Cross-Lingual Transfer	The successful adaptation of multilingual language models (LMs) to a specific language-task pair critically depends on the availability of data tailored for that condition. While cross-lingual transfer (XLT) methods have contributed to addressing this data scarcity problem, there still exists ongoing debate about the mechanisms behind their effectiveness.In this work, we focus on one of promising assumptions about inner workings of XLT, that it encourages multilingual LMs to place greater emphasis on language-agnostic or task-specific features. We test this hypothesis by examining how the patterns of XLT change with a varying number of source languages involved in the process.Our experimental findings show that the use of multiple source languages in XLT-a technique we term Multi-Source Language Training (MSLT)-leads to increased mingling of embedding spaces for different languages, supporting the claim that XLT benefits from making use of language-independent information. On the other hand, we discover that using an arbitrary combination of source languages does not always guarantee better performance. We suggest simple heuristics for identifying effective language combinations for MSLT and empirically prove its effectiveness.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.42	Seonghoon Lim, Taejun Yun, Jinhyeon Kim, Jihun Choi, Taeuk Kim
Hyper-CL: Conditioning Sentence Representations with Hypernetworks	While the introduction of contrastive learning frameworks in sentence representation learning has significantly contributed to advancements in the field, it still remains unclear whether state-of-the-art sentence embeddings can capture the fine-grained semantics of sentences, particularly when conditioned on specific perspectives.In this paper, we introduce Hyper-CL, an efficient methodology that integrates hypernetworks with contrastive learning to compute conditioned sentence representations.In our proposed approach, the hypernetwork is responsible for transforming pre-computed condition embeddings into corresponding projection layers. This enables the same sentence embeddings to be projected differently according to various conditions.Evaluation on two representative conditioning benchmarks, namely conditional semantic text similarity and knowledge graph completion, demonstrates that Hyper-CL is effective in flexibly conditioning sentence representations, showcasing its computational efficiency at the same time.We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the inner workings of our approach, leading to a better interpretation of its mechanisms.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.41	Young Yoo, Jii Cha, Changhyeon Kim, Taeuk Kim
FOFO: A Benchmark to Evaluate LLMs’ Format-Following Capability	This paper presents FoFo, a pioneering benchmark for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) ability to follow complex, domain-specific formats, a crucial yet under-examined capability for their application as AI agents. Despite LLMs' advancements, existing benchmarks fail to assess their format-following proficiency adequately. FoFo fills this gap with a diverse range of real-world formats and instructions, developed through an AI-Human collaborative method. Our evaluation across both open-source (e.g., Llama 2, WizardLM) and closed-source (e.g., GPT-4, PALM2, Gemini) LLMs highlights three key findings: open-source models significantly lag behind closed-source ones in format adherence; LLMs' format-following performance is independent of their content generation quality; and LLMs' format proficiency varies across different domains. These insights suggest the need for specialized tuning for format-following skills and highlight FoFo's role in guiding the selection of domain-specific AI agents. FoFo will be publicly released, contributing a critical tool for advancing LLM evaluation and application.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.40	Congying Xia, Chen Xing, Jiangshu Du, Xinyi Yang, Yihao Feng, Ran Xu, Wenpeng Yin, Caiming Xiong
DocLens: Multi-aspect Fine-grained Medical Text Evaluation	Medical text generation aims to assist with administrative work and highlight salient information to support decision-making.To reflect the specific requirements of medical text, in this paper, we propose a set of metrics to evaluate the completeness, conciseness, and attribution of the generated text at a fine-grained level. The metrics can be computed by various types of evaluators including instruction-following (both proprietary and open-source) and supervised entailment models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting framework, DocLens, with three evaluators on three tasks: clinical note generation, radiology report summarization, and patient question summarization. A comprehensive human study shows that DocLens exhibits substantially higher agreement with the judgments of medical experts than existing metrics. The results also highlight the need to improve open-source evaluators and suggest potential directions. We released the code at https://github.com/yiqingxyq/DocLens.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.39	Yiqing Xie, Sheng Zhang, Hao Cheng, Pengfei Liu, Zelalem Gero, Cliff Wong, Tristan Naumann, Hoifung Poon, Carolyn Rose
Multimodal Instruction Tuning with Conditional Mixture of LoRA	Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in diverse tasks across different domains, with an increasing focus on improving their zero-shot generalization capabilities for unseen multimodal tasks. Multimodal instruction tuning has emerged as a successful strategy for achieving zero-shot generalization by fine-tuning pre-trained models on diverse multimodal tasks through instructions. As MLLMs grow in complexity and size, the need for parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA), which fine-tunes with a minimal set of parameters, becomes essential. However, applying LoRA in multimodal instruction tuning presents the challenge of task interference, which leads to performance degradation, especially when dealing with a broad array of multimodal tasks. To address this, this paper introduces a novel approach that integrates multimodal instruction tuning with Conditional Mixture-of-LoRA (MixLoRA). It innovates upon LoRA by dynamically constructing low-rank adaptation matrices tailored to the unique demands of each input instance, aiming to mitigate task interference. Experimental results on various multimodal evaluation datasets indicate that MixLoRA not only outperforms the conventional LoRA with the same or even higher ranks, demonstrating its efficacy and adaptability in diverse multimodal tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.38	Ying Shen, Zhiyang Xu, Qifan Wang, Yu Cheng, Wenpeng Yin, Lifu Huang
OPEx: A Component-Wise Analysis of LLM-Centric Agents in Embodied Instruction Following	Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) is a crucial task in embodied learning, requiring agents to interact with their environment through egocentric observations to fulfill natural language instructions. Recent advancements have seen a surge in employing large language models (LLMs) within a framework-centric approach to enhance performance in embodied learning tasks, including EIF. Despite these efforts, there exists a lack of a unified understanding regarding the impact of various components—ranging from visual perception to action execution—on task performance. To address this gap, we introduce OPEx, a comprehensive framework that delineates the core components essential for solving embodied learning tasks: Observer, Planner, and Executor. Through extensive evaluations, we provide a deep analysis of how each component influences EIF task performance. Furthermore, we innovate within this space by integrating a multi-agent design into the Planner component of our LLM-centric architecture, further enhancing task performance. Our findings reveal that LLM-centric design markedly improves EIF outcomes, identify visual perception and low-level action execution as critical bottlenecks, and demonstrate that augmenting LLMs with a multi-agent framework further elevates performance.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.37	Haochen Shi, Zhiyuan Sun, Xingdi Yuan, Marc-Alexandre Côté, Bang Liu
SPOR: A Comprehensive and Practical Evaluation Method for Compositional Generalization in Data-to-Text Generation	Compositional generalization is an important ability of language models and has many different manifestations. For data-to-text generation, previous research on this ability is limited to a single manifestation called Systematicity and lacks consideration of large language models (LLMs), which cannot fully cover practical application scenarios. In this work, we propose SPOR, a comprehensive and practical evaluation method for compositional generalization in data-to-text generation. SPOR includes four aspects of manifestations (Systematicity, Productivity, Order invariance, and Rule learnability) and allows high-quality evaluation without additional manual annotations based on existing datasets. We demonstrate SPOR on two different datasets and evaluate some existing language models including LLMs. We find that the models are deficient in various aspects of the evaluation and need further improvement. Our work shows the necessity for comprehensive research on different manifestations of compositional generalization in data-to-text generation and provides a framework for evaluation.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.36	Ziyao Xu, Houfeng Wang
Leveraging Codebook Knowledge with NLI and ChatGPT for Zero-Shot Political Relation Classification	Is it possible accurately classify political relations within evolving event ontologies without extensive annotations? This study investigates zero-shot learning methods that use expert knowledge from existing annotation codebook, and evaluates the performance of advanced ChatGPT (GPT-3.5/4) and a natural language inference (NLI)-based model called ZSP. ChatGPT uses codebook's labeled summaries as prompts, whereas ZSP breaks down the classification task into context, event mode, and class disambiguation to refine task-specific hypotheses. This decomposition enhances interpretability, efficiency, and adaptability to schema changes. The experiments reveal ChatGPT's strengths and limitations, and crucially show ZSP's outperformance of dictionary-based methods and its competitive edge over some supervised models. These findings affirm the value of ZSP for validating event records and advancing ontology development. Our study underscores the efficacy of leveraging transfer learning and existing domain expertise to enhance research efficiency and scalability.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.35	Yibo Hu, Erick Skorupa Parolin, Latifur Khan, Patrick Brandt, Javier Osorio, Vito D’Orazio
Wav2Gloss: Generating Interlinear Glossed Text from Speech	Thousands of the world's languages are in danger of extinction—a tremendous threat to cultural identities and human language diversity. Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) is a form of linguistic annotation that can support documentation and resource creation for these languages' communities. IGT typically consists of (1) transcriptions, (2) morphological segmentation, (3) glosses, and (4) free translations to a majority language. We propose Wav2Gloss: a task in which these four annotation components are extracted automatically from speech, and introduce the first dataset to this end, Fieldwork: a corpus of speech with all these annotations, derived from the work of field linguists, covering 37 languages, with standard formatting, and train/dev/test splits. We provide various baselines to lay the groundwork for future research on IGT generation from speech, such as end-to-end versus cascaded, monolingual versus multilingual, and single-task versus multi-task approaches.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.34	Taiqi He, Kwanghee Choi, Lindia Tjuatja, Nathaniel Robinson, Jiatong Shi, Shinji Watanabe, Graham Neubig, David Mortensen, Lori Levin
Can Your Model Tell a Negation from an Implicature? Unravelling Challenges With Intent Encoders	Conversational systems often rely on embedding models for intent classification and intent clustering tasks. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), which enable instructional embeddings allowing one to adjust semantics over the embedding space using prompts, are being viewed as a panacea for these downstream conversational tasks. However, traditional evaluation benchmarks rely solely on task metrics that don't particularly measure gaps related to semantic understanding. Thus, we propose an intent semantic toolkit that gives a more holistic view of intent embedding models by considering three tasks– (1) intent classification, (2) intent clustering, and (3) a novel triplet task. The triplet task gauges the model's understanding of two semantic concepts paramount in real-world conversational systems– negation and implicature. We observe that current embedding models fare poorly in semantic understanding of these concepts. To address this, we propose a pre-training approach to improve the embedding model by leveraging augmentation with data generated by an auto-regressive model and a contrastive loss term. Our approach improves the semantic understanding of the intent embedding model on the aforementioned linguistic dimensions while slightly effecting their performance on downstream task metrics.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.33	Yuwei Zhang, Siffi Singh, Sailik Sengupta, Igor Shalyminov, Hang Su, Hwanjun Song, Saab Mansour
An Information-Theoretic Approach to Analyze NLP Classification Tasks	Understanding the contribution of the inputs on the output is useful across many tasks. This work provides an information-theoretic framework to analyse the influence of inputs for text classification tasks. Natural language processing (NLP) tasks take either a single or multiple text elements to predict an output variable. Each text element has two components: the semantic meaning and a linguistic realization. Multiple-choice reading comprehension (MCRC) and sentiment classification (SC) are selected to showcase the framework. For MCRC, it is found that the relative context influence on the output reduces on more challenging datasets. In particular, more challenging contexts allows greater variation in the question complexity. Hence, test creators need to carefully consider the choice of the context when designing multiple-choice questions for assessment. For SC, it is found the semantic meaning of the input dominates compared to its linguistic realization when determining the sentiment. The framework is made available at: https://github.com/WangLuran/nlp-element-influence.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.32	Luran Wang, Mark Gales, Vatsal Raina
Pouring Your Heart Out: Investigating the Role of Figurative Language in Online Expressions of Empathy	Empathy is a social mechanism used to support and strengthen emotional connection with others, including in online communities. However, little is currently known about the nature of these online expressions, nor the particular factors that may lead to their improved detection. In this work, we study the role of a specific and complex subcategory of linguistic phenomena, figurative language, in online expressions of empathy. Our extensive experiments reveal that incorporating features regarding the use of metaphor, idiom, and hyperbole into empathy detection models improves their performance, resulting in impressive maximum F1 scores of 0.942 and 0.809 for identifying posts without and with empathy, respectively.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.31	Gyeongeun Lee, Christina Wong, Meghan Guo, Natalie Parde
GradSafe: Detecting Jailbreak Prompts for LLMs via Safety-Critical Gradient Analysis	Large Language Models (LLMs) face threats from jailbreak prompts. Existing methods for detecting jailbreak prompts are primarily online moderation APIs or finetuned LLMs. These strategies, however, often require extensive and resource-intensive data collection and training processes. In this study, we propose GradSafe, which effectively detects jailbreak prompts by scrutinizing the gradients of safety-critical parameters in LLMs. Our method is grounded in a pivotal observation: the gradients of an LLM's loss for jailbreak prompts paired with compliance response exhibit similar patterns on certain safety-critical parameters. In contrast, safe prompts lead to different gradient patterns. Building on this observation, GradSafe analyzes the gradients from prompts (paired with compliance responses) to accurately detect jailbreak prompts. We show that GradSafe, applied to Llama-2 without further training, outperforms Llama Guard—despite its extensive finetuning with a large dataset—in detecting jailbreak prompts. This superior performance is consistent across both zero-shot and adaptation scenarios, as evidenced by our evaluations on ToxicChat and XSTest.

Every Answer Matters: Evaluating Commonsense with Probabilistic Measures	"Large language models have demonstrated impressive performance on commonsense tasks; however, these tasks are often posed as multiple-choice questions, allowing models to exploit systematic biases. Commonsense is also inherently probabilistic with multiple correct answers. The purpose of ""boiling water"" could be making tea, cooking but also could be killing germs. Existing tasks do not capture the probabilistic nature of common sense. To this end, we present commonsense frame completion (CFC), a new generative task that evaluates common sense via multiple open-ended generations. We also propose a method of probabilistic evaluation that strongly correlates with human judgments. Humans drastically outperform strong language model baselines on our dataset, indicating this approach is both a challenging and useful evaluation of machine common sense."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.29	Qi Cheng, Michael Boratko, Pranay Kumar Yelugam, Tim O’Gorman, Nalini Singh, Andrew McCallum, Xiang Li
Explore Spurious Correlations at the Concept Level in Language Models for Text Classification	Language models (LMs) have achieved notable success in numerous NLP tasks, employing both fine-tuning and in-context learning (ICL) methods. While language models demonstrate exceptional performance, they face robustness challenges due to spurious correlations arising from imbalanced label distributions in training data or ICL exemplars. Previous research has primarily concentrated on word, phrase, and syntax features, neglecting the concept level, often due to the absence of concept labels and difficulty in identifying conceptual content in input texts. This paper introduces two main contributions. First, we employ ChatGPT to assign concept labels to texts, assessing concept bias in models during fine-tuning or ICL on test data. We find that LMs, when encountering spurious correlations between a concept and a label in training or prompts, resort to shortcuts for predictions. Second, we introduce a data rebalancing technique that incorporates ChatGPT-generated counterfactual data, thereby balancing label distribution and mitigating spurious correlations. Our method's efficacy, surpassing traditional token removal approaches, is validated through extensive testing.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.28	Yuhang Zhou, Paiheng Xu, Xiaoyu Liu, Bang An, Wei Ai, Furong Huang
Answer is All You Need: Instruction-following Text Embedding via Answering the Question	"This work aims to build a text embedder that can capture characteristics of texts specified by user instructions clarifying the similarity criterion. While previous methods improve general task awareness by injecting the instruction information into encoding, they fail to be sensitive to clearer criteria like ""evaluate similarity based on emotion"". We instead propose a different viewpoint, which treats the instruction as a ""question"" about the input text and encodes the expected answers to obtain the representation accordingly. Intuitively, texts with the same (implicit) semantics would share similar answers following the instruction, thus leading to more similar representations. Specifically, we propose InBedder that instantiates this learning-to-answer idea by only fine-tuning language models via abstractive question answering tasks. Despite its simplicity, InBedder demonstrates significantly improved instruction-following capabilities according to our proposed instruction awareness tests and instruction robustness tests, when applied to language models with large language models (LLMs) (e.g., llama-2-7b) and smaller encoder-based LMs (e.g., roberta-large). Additionally, our qualitative analysis of clustering outcomes, achieved by applying diverse instructions to the same unlabeled corpus, demonstrates a high degree of interpretability in the clusters formed."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.27	Letian Peng, Yuwei Zhang, Zilong Wang, Jayanth Srinivasa, Gaowen Liu, Zihan Wang, Jingbo Shang
TTM-RE: Memory-Augmented Document-Level Relation Extraction	Document-level relation extraction aims to categorize the association between any two entities within a document.We find that previous methods for document-level relation extraction are ineffective in exploiting the full potential of large amounts of training data with varied noise levels. For example, in the ReDocRED benchmark dataset, state-of-the-art methods trained on the large-scale, lower-quality, distantly supervised training data generally do not perform better than those trained solely on the smaller, high-quality, human-annotated training data. To unlock the full potential of large-scale noisy training data for document-level relation extraction, we propose TTM-RE, a novel approach that integrates a trainable memory module, known as the Token Turing Machine, with a noisy-robust loss function that accounts for the positive-unlabeled setting. The trainable memory module enhances knowledge extraction from the large-scale noisy training dataset through an explicit learning of the memory tokens and a soft integration of the learned memory tokens into the input representation, thereby improving the model's effectiveness for the final relation classification. Extensive experiments on ReDocRED, a benchmark dataset for document-level relation extraction, reveal that TTM-RE achieves state-of-the-art performance (with an absolute F1 score improvement of over 3%). Ablation studies further illustrate the superiority of TTM-RE in other domains (the ChemDisGene dataset in the biomedical domain) and under highly unlabeled settings.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.26	Chufan Gao, Xuan Wang, Jimeng Sun
Framing in the Presence of Supporting Data: A Case Study in U.S. Economic News	The mainstream media has much leeway in what it chooses to cover and how it covers it. These choices have real-world consequences on what people know and their subsequent behaviors. However, the lack of objective measures to evaluate editorial choices makes research in this area particularly difficult. In this paper, we argue that there are newsworthy topics where objective measures exist in the form of supporting data and propose a computational framework to analyze editorial choices in this setup. We focus on the economy because the reporting of economic indicators presents us with a relatively easy way to determine both the selection and framing of various publications. Their values provide a ground truth of how the economy is doing relative to how the publications choose to cover it. To do this, we define frame prediction as a set of interdependent tasks. At the article level, we learn to identify the reported stance towards the general state of the economy. Then, for every numerical quantity reported in the article, we learn to identify whether it corresponds to an economic indicator and whether it is being reported in a positive or negative way. To perform our analysis, we track six American publishers and each article that appeared in the top 10 slots of their landing page between 2015 and 2023.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.24	Alexandria Leto, Elliot Pickens, Coen Needell, David Rothschild, Maria Leonor Pacheco
Mementos: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Model Reasoning over Image Sequences	Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in handling a variety of visual-language tasks. However, current MLLM benchmarks are predominantly designed to evaluate reasoning based on static information about a single image, and the ability of modern MLLMs to extrapolate from image sequences, which is essential for understanding our ever-changing world, has been less investigated. To address this challenge, this paper introduces Mementos, a new benchmark designed to assess MLLMs' sequential image reasoning abilities. Mementos features 4,761 diverse image sequences with varying lengths. We also employ a GPT-4 assisted method to evaluate MLLM reasoning performance. Through a careful evaluation of nine recent MLLMs on Mementos, including GPT-4V and Gemini, we find that they struggle to accurately describe dynamic information about given image sequences, often leading to hallucinations/misrepresentations of objects and their corresponding behaviors. Our quantitative analysis and case studies identify three key factors impacting MLLMs' sequential image reasoning: the correlation between object and behavioral hallucinations, the influence of co-occurring behaviors, and the compounding impact of behavioral hallucinations.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.25	Xiyao Wang, Yuhang Zhou, Xiaoyu Liu, Hongjin Lu, Yuancheng Xu, Feihong He, Jaehong Yoon, Taixi Lu, Fuxiao Liu, Gedas Bertasius, Mohit Bansal, Huaxiu Yao, Furong Huang
Subtle Biases Need Subtler Measures: Dual Metrics for Evaluating Representative and Affinity Bias in Large Language Models	Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) has often neglected subtle biases that, although less apparent, can significantly influence the models' outputs toward particular social narratives. This study addresses two such biases within LLMs: representative bias, which denotes a tendency of LLMs to generate outputs that mirror the experiences of certain identity groups, and affinity bias, reflecting the models' evaluative preferences for specific narratives or viewpoints. We introduce two novel metrics to measure these biases: the Representative Bias Score (RBS) and the Affinity Bias Score (ABS), and present the Creativity-Oriented Generation Suite (CoGS), a collection of open-ended tasks such as short story writing and poetry composition, designed with customized rubrics to detect these subtle biases. Our analysis uncovers marked representative biases in prominent LLMs, with a preference for identities associated with being white, straight, and men. Furthermore, our investigation of affinity bias reveals distinctive evaluative patterns within each model, akin to 'bias fingerprints'. This trend is also seen in human evaluators, highlighting a complex interplay between human and machine bias perceptions.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.23	Abhishek Kumar, Sarfaroz Yunusov, Ali Emami
Picturing Ambiguity: A Visual Twist on the Winograd Schema Challenge	Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in tasks like the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), showcasing advanced textual common-sense reasoning. However, applying this reasoning to multimodal domains, where understanding text and images together is essential, remains a substantial challenge. To address this, we introduce WinoVis, a novel dataset specifically designed to probe text-to-image models on pronoun disambiguation within multimodal contexts. Utilizing GPT-4 for prompt generation and Diffusion Attentive Attribution Maps (DAAM) for heatmap analysis, we propose a novel evaluation framework that isolates the models' ability in pronoun disambiguation from other visual processing challenges. Evaluation of successive model versions reveals that, despite incremental advancements, Stable Diffusion 2.0 achieves a precision of 56.7% on WinoVis, only marginally surpassing random guessing. Further error analysis identifies important areas for future research aimed at advancing text-to-image models in their ability to interpret and interact with the complex visual world.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.22	Brendan Park, Madeline Janecek, Naser Ezzati-Jivan, Yifeng Li, Ali Emami
Retrieval-Augmented Multilingual Knowledge Editing	Knowledge represented in Large Language Models (LLMs) is quite often incorrect and can also become obsolete over time. Updating knowledge via fine-tuning is computationally resource-hungry and not reliable, and so knowledge editing (KE) has developed as an effective and economical alternative to inject new knowledge or to fix factual errors in LLMs. Although there has been considerable interest in this area, current KE research exclusively focuses on monolingual settings, typically in English. However, what happens if the new knowledge is supplied in one language, but we would like to query an LLM in a different language? To address the problem of multilingual knowledge editing, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Multilingual Knowledge Editor (ReMaKE) to update knowledge in LLMs. ReMaKE can be used to perform model-agnostic knowledge editing in a multilingual setting. ReMaKE concatenates the new knowledge retrieved from a multilingual knowledge base with users' prompts before querying an LLM. Our experimental results show that ReMaKE outperforms baseline knowledge editing methods by a significant margin and is scalable to real-word application scenarios. Our multilingual knowledge editing dataset (MzsRE) in 12 languages, the code, and additional project information are available at https://github.com/weixuan-wang123/ReMaKE.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.21	Weixuan Wang, Barry Haddow, Alexandra Birch
Confidence Under the Hood: An Investigation into the Confidence-Probability Alignment in Large Language Models	As the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes more widespread, understanding their self-evaluation of confidence in generated responses becomes increasingly important as it is integral to the reliability of the output of these models. We introduce the concept of Confidence-Probability Alignment, that connects an LLM's internal confidence, quantified by token probabilities, to the confidence conveyed in the model's response when explicitly asked about its certainty. Using various datasets and prompting techniques that encourage model introspection, we probe the alignment between models' internal and expressed confidence. These techniques encompass using structured evaluation scales to rate confidence, including answer options when prompting, and eliciting the model's confidence level for outputs it does not recognize as its own. Notably, among the models analyzed, OpenAI's GPT-4 showed the strongest confidence-probability alignment, with an average Spearman's ̂𝜌 of 0.42, across a wide range of tasks. Our work contributes to the ongoing efforts to facilitate risk assessment in the application of LLMs and to further our understanding of model trustworthiness.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.20	Abhishek Kumar, Robert Morabito, Sanzhar Umbet, Jad Kabbara, Ali Emami
Expedited Training of Visual Conditioned Language Generation via Redundancy Reduction	We introduce EVL Gen , a streamlined framework designed for the pre-training of visually conditioned language generation models with high computational demands, utilizing frozen pre-trained large language models (LLMs). The conventional approach in vision-language pre-training (VLP) typically involves a two-stage optimization process: an initial resource-intensive phase dedicated to general-purpose vision-language representation learning, focused on extracting and consolidating relevant visual features. This is followed by a subsequent phase that emphasizes end-to-end alignment between visual and linguistic modalities. Our novel one-stage, single-loss framework bypasses the computationally demanding first training stage by gradually merging similar visual tokens during training, while avoiding model collapse caused by single-stage training of BLIP-2 type models. The gradual merging process effectively condenses visual information while preserving semantic richness, resulting in rapid convergence without compromising performance. Our experimental findings demonstrate that our approach accelerates the training of vision-language models by a factor of 5 without a noticeable impact on overall performance. Furthermore, we illustrate that our models significantly narrow the performance gap to current vision-language models using only 1/10 of the data. Finally, we showcase how our image-text models can seamlessly adapt to video-conditioned language generation tasks through novel soft attentive temporal token contextualizing modules.

SciMON: Scientific Inspiration Machines Optimized for Novelty	"We explore and enhance the ability of neural language models to generate novel scientific directions grounded in literature. Work on literature-based hypothesis generation has traditionally focused on binary link prediction—severely limiting the expressivity of hypotheses. This line of work also does not focus on optimizing novelty. We take a dramatic departure with a novel setting in which models use as input background contexts (e.g., problems, experimental settings, goals), and output natural language ideas grounded in literature. We present SciMON, a modeling framework that uses retrieval of ""inspirations"" from past scientific papers, and explicitly optimizes for novelty by iteratively comparing to prior papers and updating idea suggestions until sufficient novelty is achieved. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that GPT-4 tends to generate ideas with overall low technical depth and novelty, while our methods partially mitigate this issue. Our work represents a first step toward evaluating and developing language models that generate new ideas derived from the scientific literature.

SportsMetrics: Blending Text and Numerical Data to Understand Information Fusion in LLMs	Large language models hold significant potential for integrating various data types, such as text documents and database records, for advanced analytics. However, blending text and numerical data presents substantial challenges. LLMs need to process and cross-reference entities and numbers, handle data inconsistencies and redundancies, and develop planning capabilities such as building a working memory for managing complex data queries. In this paper, we introduce four novel tasks centered around sports data analytics to evaluate the numerical reasoning and information fusion capabilities of LLMs. These tasks involve providing LLMs with detailed, play-by-play sports game descriptions, then challenging them with adversarial scenarios such as new game rules, longer durations, scrambled narratives, and analyzing key statistics in game summaries. We conduct extensive experiments on NBA and NFL games to assess the performance of LLMs on these tasks. Our benchmark, SportsMetrics, introduces a new mechanism for assessing LLMs' numerical reasoning and fusion skills.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.17	Yebowen Hu, Kaiqiang Song, Sangwoo Cho, Xiaoyang Wang, Hassan Foroosh, Dong Yu, Fei Liu
MinPrompt: Graph-based Minimal Prompt Data Augmentation for Few-shot Question Answering	Recent advances in few-shot question answering (QA) mostly rely on the power of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and fine-tuning in specific settings. Although the pre-training stage has already equipped LLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities, LLMs still need to be fine-tuned to adapt to specific domains to achieve the best results. In this paper, we propose to select the most informative data for fine-tuning, thereby improving the efficiency of the fine-tuning process with comparative or even better accuracy on the open-domain QA task. We present MinPrompt, a minimal data augmentation framework for open-domain QA based on an approximate graph algorithm and unsupervised question generation. We transform the raw text into a graph structure to build connections between different factual sentences, then apply graph algorithms to identify the minimal set of sentences needed to cover the most information in the raw text. We then generate QA pairs based on the identified sentence subset and train the model on the selected sentences to obtain the final model. Empirical results on several benchmark datasets and theoretical analysis show that MinPrompt is able to achieve comparable or better results than baselines with a high degree of efficiency, bringing consistent improvements in F-1 scores.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.16	Xiusi Chen, Jyun-Yu Jiang, Wei-Cheng Chang, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Hsiang-Fu Yu, Wei Wang
A Novel Cartography-Based Curriculum Learning Method Applied on RoNLI: The First Romanian Natural Language Inference Corpus	Natural language inference (NLI), the task of recognizing the entailment relationship in sentence pairs, is an actively studied topic serving as a proxy for natural language understanding. Despite the relevance of the task in building conversational agents and improving text classification, machine translation and other NLP tasks, to the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available NLI corpus for the Romanian language. To this end, we introduce the first Romanian NLI corpus (RoNLI) comprising 58K training sentence pairs, which are obtained via distant supervision, and 6K validation and test sentence pairs, which are manually annotated with the correct labels. We conduct experiments with multiple machine learning methods based on distant learning, ranging from shallow models based on word embeddings to transformer-based neural networks, to establish a set of competitive baselines. Furthermore, we improve on the best model by employing a new curriculum learning strategy based on data cartography. Our dataset and code to reproduce the baselines are available at https://github.com/Eduard6421/RONLI.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.15	Eduard Poesina, Cornelia Caragea, Radu Ionescu
Inference to the Best Explanation in Large Language Models	While Large Language Models (LLMs) have found success in real-world applications, their underlying explanatory process is still poorly understood. This paper proposes IBE-Eval, a framework inspired by philosophical accounts on Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE) to advance the interpretation and evaluation of LLMs' explanations. IBE-Eval estimates the plausibility of natural language explanations through a combination of explicit logical and linguistic features including: consistency, parsimony, coherence, and uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on Causal Question Answering (CQA), where IBE-Eval is tasked to select the most plausible causal explanation amongst competing ones generated by LLMs (i.e., GPT 3.5 and Llama 2). The experiments reveal that IBE-Eval can successfully identify the best explanation with up to 77% accuracy ( ≈ 27% above random), improving upon a GPT 3.5-as-a-Judge baseline ( ≈+17% ) while being intrinsically more efficient and interpretable. Additional analyses suggest that, despite model-specific variances, LLM-generated explanations tend to conform to IBE criteria and that IBE-Eval is significantly correlated with human judgment, opening up opportunities for future development of automated explanation verification tools.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.14	Dhairya Dalal, Marco Valentino, Andre Freitas, Paul Buitelaar
Through the Lens of Split Vote: Exploring Disagreement, Difficulty and Calibration in Legal Case Outcome Classification	In legal decisions, split votes (SV) occur when judges cannot reach a unanimous decision, posing a difficulty for lawyers who must navigate diverse legal arguments and opinions. In high-stakes domains, %as human-AI interaction systems become increasingly important, understanding the alignment of perceived difficulty between humans and AI systems is crucial to build trust. However, existing NLP calibration methods focus on a classifier's awareness of predictive performance, measured against the human majority class, overlooking inherent human label variation (HLV). This paper explores split votes as naturally observable human disagreement and value pluralism. We collect judges' vote distributions from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), and present SV-ECHR, a case outcome classification (COC) dataset with SV information. We build a taxonomy of disagreement with SV-specific subcategories. We further assess the alignment of perceived difficulty between models and humans, as well as confidence- and human-calibration of COC models. We observe limited alignment with the judge vote distribution. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic exploration of calibration to human judgements in legal NLP. Our study underscores the necessity for further research on measuring and enhancing model calibration considering HLV in legal decision tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.13	Shanshan Xu, Santosh T.y.s.s, Oana Ichim, Barbara Plank, Matthias Grabmair
How Abilities in Large Language Models are Affected by Supervised Fine-tuning Data Composition	Large language models (LLMs) with enormous pre-training tokens and parameters emerge diverse abilities, including math reasoning, codegeneration, and instruction following. These abilities are further enhanced by supervised fine-tuning (SFT). While the open-source community has explored ad-hoc SFT for enhancing individual capabilities, proprietary LLMs exhibit versatility across various skills. Therefore, understanding the facilitation of multiple abilities via SFT is paramount. In this study, we specificially focuses on the interplay of data composition between mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general human-aligning abilities during SFT. We propose four intriguing research questions to explore the association between model performance and various factors including data amount, composition ratio, model size and SFT strategies. Our experiments reveal that distinct capabilities scale differently and larger models generally show superior performance with same amount of data. Mathematical reasoning and code generation consistently improve with increasing data amount, whereas general abilities plateau after roughly a thousand samples. Moreover, we observe data composition appears to enhance various abilities under limited data conditions, yet can lead to performance conflicts when data is plentiful. Our findings also suggest the amount of composition data influences performance more than the composition ratio. In analysis of SFT strategies, we find that sequentially learning multiple skills risks catastrophic forgetting. Our proposed Dual-stage Mixed Fine-tuning (DMT) strategy offers a promising solution to learn multiple abilities with different scaling patterns.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.12	Guanting Dong, Hongyi Yuan, Keming Lu, Chengpeng Li, Mingfeng Xue, Dayiheng Liu, Wei Wang, Zheng Yuan, Chang Zhou, Jingren Zhou
Evaluating Dynamic Topic Models	There is a lack of quantitative measures to evaluate the progression of topics through time in dynamic topic models (DTMs). Filling this gap, we propose a novel evaluation measure for DTMs that analyzes the changes in the quality of each topic over time. Additionally, we propose an extension combining topic quality with the model's temporal consistency. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed measure by applying it to synthetic data and data from existing DTMs, including DTMs from large language models (LLMs). We also show that the proposed measure correlates well with human judgment. Our findings may help in identifying changing topics, evaluating different DTMs and LLMs, and guiding future research in this area.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.11	Charu Karakkaparambil James, Mayank Nagda, Nooshin Haji Ghassemi, Marius Kloft, Sophie Fellenz
CSCD-NS: a Chinese Spelling Check Dataset for Native Speakers	In this paper, we present CSCD-NS, the first Chinese spelling check (CSC) dataset designed for native speakers, containing 40,000 samples from a Chinese social platform. Compared with existing CSC datasets aimed at Chinese learners, CSCD-NS is ten times larger in scale and exhibits a distinct error distribution, with a significantly higher proportion of word-level errors. To further enhance the data resource, we propose a novel method that simulates the input process through an input method, generating large-scale and high-quality pseudo data that closely resembles the actual error distribution and outperforms existing methods. Moreover, we investigate the performance of various models in this scenario, including large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. The result indicates that generative models underperform BERT-like classification models due to strict length and pronunciation constraints. The high prevalence of word-level errors also makes CSC for native speakers challenging enough, leaving substantial room for improvement.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.10	Yong Hu, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou
Unsupervised Information Refinement Training of Large Language Models for Retrieval-Augmented Generation	"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating additional information from retrieval. However, studies have shown that LLMs still face challenges in effectively using the retrieved information, even ignore it or be misled by it. The key reason is that the training of LLMs does not clearly make LLMs learn how to utilize input retrieved texts with varied quality. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective that considers the role of LLMs in RAG as ""Information Refiner"", which means that regardless of correctness, completeness, or usefulness of retrieved texts, LLMs can consistently integrate knowledge within the retrieved texts and model parameters to generate the texts that are more concise, accurate, and complete than the retrieved texts. To this end, we propose an information refinement training method named INFO-RAG that optimizes LLMs for RAG in an unsupervised manner. INFO-RAG is low-cost and general across various tasks. Extensive experiments on zero-shot prediction of 11 datasets in diverse tasks including Question Answering, Slot-Filling, Language Modeling, Dialogue, and Code Generation show that INFO-RAG improves the performance of LLaMA2 by an average of 9.39% relative points. INFO-RAG also shows advantages in in-context learning and robustness of RAG."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.9	Shicheng Xu, Liang Pang, Mo Yu, Fandong Meng, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng, Jie Zhou
A Unified Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning Model Towards Interpolation and Extrapolation	Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning has two settings: interpolation reasoning and extrapolation reasoning. Both of them draw plenty of research interest and have great significance. Methods of the former de-emphasize the temporal correlations among facts sequences, while methods of the latter require strict chronological order of knowledge and ignore inferring clues provided by missing facts of the past. These limit the practicability of TKG applications as almost all of the existing TKG reasoning methods are designed specifically to address either one setting. To this end, this paper proposes an original Temporal PAth-based Reasoning (TPAR) model for both the interpolation and extrapolation reasoning settings. TPAR performs a neural-driven symbolic reasoning fashion that is robust to ambiguous and noisy temporal data, and with fine interpretability as well. Comprehensive experiments show that TPAR outperforms SOTA methods on the link prediction task for both the interpolation and the extrapolation settings. A novel pipeline experimental setting is designed to evaluate the performances of SOTA combinations and the proposed TPAR towards interpolation and extrapolation reasoning. And more diverse experiments are conducted to show the robustness and interpretability of TPAR.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.8	Kai Chen, Ye Wang, Yitong Li, Aiping Li, Han Yu, Xin Song
BitDistiller: Unleashing the Potential of Sub-4-Bit LLMs via Self-Distillation	The upscaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has yielded impressive advances in natural language processing, yet it also poses significant deployment challenges. Weight quantization has emerged as a widely embraced solution to reduce memory and computational demands. This paper introduces BitDistiller, a framework that synergizes Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with Knowledge Distillation (KD) to boost the performance of LLMs at ultra-low precisions (sub-4-bit). Specifically, BitDistiller first incorporates a tailored asymmetric quantization and clipping technique to maximally preserve the fidelity of quantized weights, and then proposes a novel Confidence-Aware Kullback-Leibler Divergence (CAKLD) objective, which is employed in a self-distillation manner to enable faster convergence and superior model performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that BitDistiller significantly surpasses existing methods in both 3-bit and 2-bit configurations on general language understanding and complex reasoning benchmarks. Notably, BitDistiller is shown to be more cost-effective, demanding fewer data and training resources.

Exploring Chain-of-Thought for Multi-modal Metaphor Detection	"Metaphors are commonly found in advertising and internet memes. However, the free form of internet memes often leads to a lack of high-quality textual data. Metaphor detection demands a deep interpretation of both textual and visual elements, requiring extensive common-sense knowledge, which poses a challenge to language models. To address these challenges, we propose a compact framework called C4MMD, which utilizes a Chain-of-Thought(CoT) method for Multi-modal Metaphor Detection. Specifically, our approach designs a three-step process inspired by CoT that extracts and integrates knowledge from Multi-modal Large Language Models(MLLMs) into smaller ones. We also developed a modality fusion architecture to transform knowledge from large models into metaphor features, supplemented by auxiliary tasks to improve model performance. Experimental results on the MET-MEME dataset demonstrate that our method not only effectively enhances the metaphor detection capabilities of small models but also outperforms existing models. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study leveraging MLLMs in metaphor detection tasks.

GenTranslate: Large Language Models are Generative Multilingual Speech and Machine Translators	Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have stepped forward the development of multilingual speech and machine translation by its reduced representation errors and incorporated external knowledge. However, both translation tasks typically utilize beam search decoding and top-1 hypothesis selection for inference. These techniques struggle to fully exploit the rich information in the diverse N-best hypotheses, making them less optimal for translation tasks that require a single, high-quality output sequence. In this paper, we propose a new generative paradigm for translation tasks, namely GenTranslate, which builds upon LLMs to generate better results from the diverse translation versions in N-best list. Leveraging the rich linguistic knowledge and strong reasoning abilities of LLMs, our new paradigm can integrate the diverse N-best candidates to generate a higher-quality translation result. Furthermore, to support LLM finetuning, we build and release a HypoTranslate dataset that contains over 592K hypotheses-translation pairs in 11 languages. Experiments on various speech and machine translation benchmarks (e.g., FLEURS, CoVoST-2, WMT) demonstrate that our GenTranslate significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art model.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.5	Yuchen Hu, Chen Chen, Chao-Han Yang, Ruizhe Li, Dong Zhang, Zhehuai Chen, EngSiong Chng
PrivLM-Bench: A Multi-level Privacy Evaluation Benchmark for Language Models	The rapid development of language models (LMs) brings unprecedented accessibility and usage for both models and users. On the one hand, powerful LMs achieve state-of-the-art performance over numerous downstream NLP tasks. On the other hand, more and more attention is paid to unrestricted model accesses that may bring malicious privacy risks of data leakage. To address these issues, many recent works propose privacy-preserving language models (PPLMs) with differential privacy (DP). Unfortunately, different DP implementations make it challenging for a fair comparison among existing PPLMs. In this paper, we present PrivLM-Bench, a multi-perspective privacy evaluation benchmark to empirically and intuitively quantify the privacy leakage of LMs. Instead of only reporting DP parameters, PrivLM-Bench sheds light on the neglected inference data privacy during actual usage. PrivLM-Bench first clearly defines multi-faceted privacy objectives. Then, PrivLM-Bench constructs a unified pipeline to perform private fine-tuning. Lastly, PrivLM-Bench performs existing privacy attacks on LMs with pre-defined privacy objectives as the empirical evaluation results. The empirical attack results are used to fairly and intuitively evaluate the privacy leakage of various PPLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets of GLUE for mainstream LMs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.4	Haoran Li, Dadi Guo, Donghao Li, Wei Fan, Qi Hu, Xin Liu, Chunkit Chan, Duanyi Yao, Yuan Yao, Yangqiu Song
MAGE: Machine-generated Text Detection in the Wild	Large language models (LLMs) have achieved human-level text generation, emphasizing the need for effective deepfake text detection to mitigate risks like the spread of fake news and plagiarism. Existing research has been constrained by evaluating detection methods o specific domains or particular language models. In practical scenarios, however, the detector faces texts from various domains or LLMs without knowing their sources. To this end, we build a comprehensive testbed by gathering texts from diverse human writings and deepfake texts generated by different LLMs. Empirical results on mainstream detection methods demonstrate the difficulties associated with detecting deepfake text in a wide-ranging testbed, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios. Such difficulties align with the diminishing linguistic differences between the two text sources. Despite challenges, the top-performing detector can identify 84.12% out-of-domain texts generated by a new LLM, indicating the feasibility for application scenarios.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.3	Yafu Li, Qintong Li, Leyang Cui, Wei Bi, Zhilin Wang, Longyue Wang, Linyi Yang, Shuming Shi, Yue Zhang
Unsupervised Multimodal Clustering for Semantics Discovery in Multimodal Utterances	Discovering the semantics of multimodal utterances is essential for understanding human language and enhancing human-machine interactions. Existing methods manifest limitations in leveraging nonverbal information for discerning complex semantics in unsupervised scenarios. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised multimodal clustering method (UMC), making a pioneering contribution to this field. UMC introduces a unique approach to constructing augmentation views for multimodal data, which are then used to perform pre-training to establish well-initialized representations for subsequent clustering. An innovative strategy is proposed to dynamically select high-quality samples as guidance for representation learning, gauged by the density of each sample's nearest neighbors. Besides, it is equipped to automatically determine the optimal value for the top- K parameter in each cluster to refine sample selection. Finally, both high- and low-quality samples are used to learn representations conducive to effective clustering. We build baselines on benchmark multimodal intent and dialogue act datasets. UMC shows remarkable improvements of 2-6% scores in clustering metrics over state-of-the-art methods, marking the first successful endeavor in this domain.

Quantized Side Tuning: Fast and Memory-Efficient Tuning of Quantized Large Language Models	Finetuning large language models (LLMs) has been empirically effective on a variety of downstream tasks. Existing approaches to finetuning an LLM either focus on parameter-efficient finetuning, which only updates a small number of trainable parameters, or attempt to reduce the memory footprint during the training phase of the finetuning. Typically, the memory footprint during finetuning stems from three contributors: model weights, optimizer states, and intermediate activations. However, existing works still require considerable memory, and none can simultaneously mitigate the memory footprint of all three sources. In this paper, we present quantized side tuing (QST), which enables memory-efficient and fast finetuning of LLMs by operating through a dual-stage process. First, QST quantizes an LLM's model weights into 4-bit to reduce the memory footprint of the LLM's original weights. Second, QST introduces a side network separated from the LLM, which utilizes the hidden states of the LLM to make task-specific predictions. Using a separate side network avoids performing back-propagation through the LLM, thus reducing the memory requirement of the intermediate activations. Finally, QST leverages several low-rank adaptors and gradient-free downsample modules to significantly reduce the trainable parameters, so as to save the memory footprint of the optimizer states. Experiments show that QST can reduce the total memory footprint by up to 2.3× and speed up the finetuning process by up to 3 × while achieving competent performance compared with the state-of-the-art. When it comes to full finetuning, QST can reduce the total memory footprint up to 7 × .	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.1	Zhengxin Zhang, Dan Zhao, Xupeng Miao, Gabriele Oliaro, Zhihao Zhang, Qing Li, Yong Jiang, Zhihao Jia
Self-Augmented In-Context Learning for Unsupervised Word Translation	Recent work has shown that, while large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong word translation or bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) capabilities in few-shot setups, they still cannot match the performance of 'traditional' mapping-based approaches in the unsupervised scenario where no seed translation pairs are available, especially for lower-resource languages. To address this challenge with LLMs, we propose self-augmented in-context learning (SAIL) for unsupervised BLI: starting from a zero-shot prompt, SAIL iteratively induces a set of high-confidence word translation pairs for in-context learning (ICL) from an LLM, which it then reapplies to the same LLM in the ICL fashion. Our method shows substantial gains over zero-shot prompting of LLMs on two established BLI benchmarks spanning a wide range of language pairs, also outperforming mapping-based baselines across the board. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art unsupervised BLI performance, we also conduct comprehensive analyses on SAIL and discuss its limitations.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.67	Yaoyiran Li, Anna Korhonen, Ivan Vulić
On the Hallucination in Simultaneous Machine Translation	It is widely known that hallucination is a critical issue in Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) due to the absence of source-side information. While many efforts have been made to enhance performance for SiMT, few of them attempt to understand and analyze hallucination in SiMT.Therefore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of hallucination in SiMT from two perspectives: understanding the distribution of hallucination words and the target-side context usage of them.Intensive experiments demonstrate some valuable findings and particularly show that it is possible to alleviate hallucination by decreasing the over usage of target-side information for SiMT.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.66	Meizhi Zhong, Kehai Chen, Zhengshan Xue, Lemao Liu, Mingming Yang, Min Zhang
Towards Artwork Explanation in Large-scale Vision Language Models	Large-scale Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) output text from images and instructions, demonstrating advanced capabilities in text generation and comprehension. However, it has not been clarified to what extent LVLMs understand the knowledge necessary for explaining images, the complex relationships between various pieces of knowledge, and how they integrate these understandings into their explanations. To address this issue, we propose a new task: the artwork explanation generation task, along with its evaluation dataset and metric for quantitatively assessing the understanding and utilization of knowledge about artworks. This task is apt for image description based on the premise that LVLMs are expected to have pre-existing knowledge of artworks, which are often subjects of wide recognition and documented information.It consists of two parts: generating explanations from both images and titles of artworks, and generating explanations using only images, thus evaluating the LVLMs' language-based and vision-based knowledge.Alongside, we release a training dataset for LVLMs to learn explanations that incorporate knowledge about artworks.Our findings indicate that LVLMs not only struggle with integrating language and visual information but also exhibit a more pronounced limitation in acquiring knowledge from images alone.

DUAL-REFLECT: Enhancing Large Language Models for Reflective Translation through Dual Learning Feedback Mechanisms	Recently, large language models (LLMs) enhanced by self-reflection have achieved promising performance on machine transla004 tion. The key idea is guiding LLMs to generate translation with human-like feedback. However, existing self-reflection methods lack effective feedback information, limiting the translation performance. To address this, we introduce a DUAL-REFLECT framework, leveraging the dual learning of translation tasks to provide effective feedback, thereby enhancing the models' self-reflective abilities and improving translation performance. The application of this method across various translation tasks has proven its effectiveness in improving translation accuracy and eliminating ambiguities, especially in translation tasks with low-resource language pairs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.64	Andong Chen, Lianzhang Lou, Kehai Chen, Xuefeng Bai, Yang Xiang, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao, Min Zhang
Annotating FrameNet via Structure-Conditioned Language Generation	Despite the remarkable generative capabilities of language models in producing naturalistic language, their effectiveness on explicit manipulation and generation of linguistic structures remain understudied. In this paper, we investigate the task of generating new sentences preserving a given semantic structure, following the FrameNet formalism. We propose a framework to produce novel frame-semantically annotated sentences following an overgenerate-and-filter approach. Our results show that conditioning on rich, explicit semantic information tends to produce generations with high human acceptance, under both prompting and finetuning. Our generated frame-semantic structured annotations are effective at training data augmentation for frame-semantic role labeling in low-resource settings; however, we do not see benefits under higher resource settings. Our study concludes that while generating high-quality, semantically rich data might be within reach, the downstream utility of such generations remains to be seen, highlighting the outstanding challenges with automating linguistic annotation tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.63	Xinyue Cui, Swabha Swayamdipta
Aligning Large Language Models via Fine-grained Supervision	Pre-trained large-scale language models (LLMs) excel at producing coherent articles, yet their outputs may be untruthful, toxic, or fail to align with user expectations. Current approaches focus on using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to improve model alignment, which works by transforming coarse human preferences of LLM outputs into a feedback signal that guides the model learning process. However, because this approach operates on sequence-level feedback, it lacks the precision to identify the exact parts of the output affecting user preferences. To address this gap, we propose a method to enhance LLM alignment through fine-grained token-level supervision. Specifically, we ask annotators to minimally edit less preferred responses within the standard reward modeling dataset to make them more favorable, ensuring changes are made only where necessary while retaining most of the original content. The refined dataset is used to train a token-level reward model, which is then used for training our fine-grained Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) model. Our experiment results demonstrate that this approach can improve LLM performance by up to 5.1% in terms of win rate against the reference model, compared with the traditional PPO model.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.62	Dehong Xu, Liang Qiu, Minseok Kim, Faisal Ladhak, Jaeyoung Do
Guidance-Based Prompt Data Augmentation in Specialized Domains for Named Entity Recognition	While the abundance of rich and vast datasets across numerous fields has facilitated the advancement of natural language processing, sectors in need of specialized data types continue to struggle with the challenge of finding quality data. Our study introduces a novel guidance data augmentation technique utilizing abstracted context and sentence structures to produce varied sentences while maintaining context-entity relationships, addressing data scarcity challenges. By fostering a closer relationship between context, sentence structure, and role of entities, our method enhances data augmentation's effectiveness. Consequently, by showcasing diversification in both entity-related vocabulary and overall sentence structure, and simultaneously improving the training performance of named entity recognition task.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.61	Hyeonseok Kang, Hyein Seo, Jeesu Jung, Sangkeun Jung, Du-Seong Chang, Riwoo Chung
Cross-Modal Projection in Multimodal LLMs Doesn’t Really Project Visual Attributes to Textual Space	Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) like LLaVA and GPT-4(V) enable general-purpose conversations about images with the language modality. As off-the-shelf MLLMs may have limited capabilities on images from domains like dermatology and agriculture, they must be fine-tuned to unlock domain-specific applications. The prevalent architecture of current open-source MLLMs comprises two major modules: an image-language (cross-modal) projection network and a large language model. It is desirable to understand the roles of these two modules in modeling domain-specific visual attributes to inform the design of future models and streamline the interpretability efforts on the current models. To this end, via experiments on 4 datasets and under 2 fine-tuning settings, we find that as the MLLM is fine-tuned, it indeed gains domain-specific visual capabilities, but the updates do not lead to the projection extracting relevant domain-specific visual attributes. Our results indicate that the domain-specific visual attributes are modeled by the LLM, even when only the projection is fine-tuned. Through this study, we offer a potential reinterpretation of the role of cross-modal projections in MLLM architectures.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.60	Gaurav Verma, Minje Choi, Kartik Sharma, Jamelle Watson-Daniels, Sejoon Oh, Srijan Kumar
Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Reranking with Large Language Models for Low-Resource Languages	Large language models (LLMs) as listwise rerankers have shown impressive zero-shot capabilities in various passage ranking tasks. Despite their success, there is still a gap in existing literature on their effectiveness in reranking low-resource languages. To address this, we investigate how LLMs function as listwise rerankers in cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) systems with queries in English and passages in four African languages: Hausa, Somali, Swahili, and Yoruba. We analyze and compare the effectiveness of monolingual reranking using either query or document translations. We also evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs when leveraging their own generated translations. To grasp the general picture, we examine the effectiveness of multiple LLMs — the proprietary models RankGPT-4 and RankGPT-3.5, along with the open-source model RankZephyr. While the document translation setting, i.e., both queries and documents are in English, leads to the best reranking effectiveness, our results indicate that for specific LLMs, reranking in the African language setting achieves competitive effectiveness with the cross-lingual setting, and even performs better when using the LLM's own translations.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.59	Mofetoluwa Adeyemi, Akintunde Oladipo, Ronak Pradeep, Jimmy Lin
How Good is Zero-Shot MT Evaluation for Low Resource Indian Languages?	While machine translation evaluation has been studied primarily for high-resource languages, there has been a recent interest in evaluation for low-resource languages due to the increasing availability of data and models. In this paper, we focus on a zero-shot evaluation setting focusing on low-resource Indian languages, namely Assamese, Kannada, Maithili, and Punjabi. We collect sufficient Multi-Dimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) and Direct Assessment (DA) annotations to create test sets and meta-evaluate a plethora of automatic evaluation metrics. We observe that even for learned metrics, which are known to exhibit zero-shot performance, the Kendall Tau and Pearson correlations with human annotations are only as high as 0.32 and 0.45. Synthetic data approaches show mixed results and overall do not help close the gap by much for these languages. This indicates that there is still a long way to go for low-resource evaluation.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.58	Anushka Singh, Ananya Sai, Raj Dabre, Ratish Puduppully, Anoop Kunchukuttan, Mitesh Khapra
Consistency Training by Synthetic Question Generation for Conversational Question Answering	Efficiently modeling historical information is a critical component in addressing user queries within a conversational question-answering (QA) context, as historical context plays a vital role in clarifying the user's questions. However, irrelevant history induces noise in the reasoning process, especially for those questions with a considerable historical context. In our novel model-agnostic approach, referred to as **CoTaH** (**Co**nsistency-**T**rained **a**ugmented **H**istory), we augment the historical information with synthetic questions and subsequently employ consistency training to train a model that utilizes both real and augmented historical data to implicitly make the reasoning robust to irrelevant history. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of research using synthetic question generation as a form of data augmentation to model conversational QA settings. By citing a common modeling error prevalent in previous research, we introduce a new baseline and compare our model's performance against it, demonstrating an improvement in results, particularly in later turns of the conversation, when dealing with questions that include a large historical context.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.57	Hamed Hemati, Hamid Beigy
Exploring Conditional Variational Mechanism to Pinyin Input Method for Addressing One-to-Many Mappings in Low-Resource Scenarios	Pinyin input method engine (IME) refers to the transformation tool from pinyin sequence to Chinese characters, which is widely used on mobile phone applications. Due to the homophones, Pinyin IME suffers from the one-to-many mapping problem in the process of pinyin sequences to Chinese characters. To solve the above issue, this paper makes the first exploration to leverage an effective conditional variational mechanism (CVM) for pinyin IME. However, to ensure the stable and smooth operation of Pinyin IME under low-resource conditions (e.g., on offline mobile devices), we should balance diversity, accuracy, and efficiency with CVM, which is still challenging. To this end, we employ a novel strategy that simplifies the complexity of semantic encoding by facilitating the interaction between pinyin and the Chinese character information during the construction of continuous latent variables. Concurrently, the accuracy of the outcomes is enhanced by capitalizing on the discrete latent variables. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.56	Bin Sun, Jianfeng Li, Hao Zhou, Fandong Meng, Kan Li, Jie Zhou
Paraphrasing in Affirmative Terms Improves Negation Understanding	Negation is a common linguistic phenomenon. Yet language models face challenges with negation in many natural language understanding tasks such as question answering and natural language inference. In this paper, we experiment with seamless strategies that incorporate affirmative interpretations (i.e., paraphrases without negation) to make models more robust against negation. Crucially, our affirmative interpretations are obtained automatically. We show improvements with CondaQA, a large corpus requiring reasoning with negation, and five natural language understanding tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.55	MohammadHossein Rezaei, Eduardo Blanco
PRewrite: Prompt Rewriting with Reinforcement Learning	"Prompt engineering is critical for the development of LLM-based applications. However, it is usually done manually in a ""trial and error"" fashion that can be time consuming, ineffective, and sub-optimal. Even for the prompts which seemingly work well, there is always a lingering question: can the prompts be made better with further modifications?To address these problems, we investigate automated prompt engineering in this paper. Specifically, we propose PRewrite, an automated method to rewrite an under-optimized prompt to a more effective prompt. We instantiate the prompt rewriter using an LLM. The rewriter LLM is trained using reinforcement learning to optimize the performance on a given downstream task. We conduct experiments on diverse benchmark datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of PRewrite."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.54	Weize Kong, Spurthi Hombaiah, Mingyang Zhang, Qiaozhu Mei, Michael Bendersky
Time Sensitive Knowledge Editing through Efficient Finetuning	Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capability in different tasks and are bringing transformative changes to many domains. However, keeping the knowledge in LLMs up-to-date remains a challenge once pretraining is complete. It is thus essential to design effective methods to both update obsolete knowledge and induce new knowledge into LLMs. Existing locate-and-edit knowledge editing (KE) method suffers from two limitations. First, the post-edit LLMs by such methods generally have poor capability in answering complex queries that require multi-hop reasoning. Second, the long run-time of such locate-and-edit methods to perform knowledge edits make it infeasible for large scale KE in practice. In this paper, we explore Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques as an alternative for KE. We curate a more comprehensive temporal KE dataset with both knowledge update and knowledge injection examples for KE performance benchmarking. We further probe the effect of fine-tuning on a range of layers in an LLM for the multi-hop QA task. We find that PEFT performs better than locate-and-edit techniques for time-sensitive knowledge edits.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.53	Xiou Ge, Ali Mousavi, Edouard Grave, Armand Joulin, Kun Qian, Benjamin Han, Mostafa Arefiyan, Yunyao Li
ConstitutionalExperts: Training a Mixture of Principle-based Prompts	Large language models (LLMs) are highly capable at a variety of tasks given the right prompt, but writing one is still a difficult and tedious process. In this work, we introduce ConstitutionalExperts, a method for learning a prompt consisting of constitutional principles (i.e. rules), given a training dataset. Unlike prior methods that optimize the prompt as a single entity, our method incrementally improves the prompt by surgically editing individual principles. We also show that we can improve overall performance by learning unique prompts for different semantic regions of the training data and using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to route inputs at inference time. We compare our method to other state of the art prompt-optimization techniques across six benchmark datasets. We also investigate whether MoE improves these other techniques. Our results suggest that ConstitutionalExperts outperforms other prompt optimization techniques by 10.9% (F1) and that mixture-of-experts improves all techniques, suggesting its broad applicability.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.52	Savvas Petridis, Ben Wedin, Ann Yuan, James Wexler, Nithum Thain
Are LLMs classical or nonmonotonic reasoners? Lessons from generics	Recent scholarship on reasoning in LLMs has supplied evidence of impressive performance and flexible adaptation to machine generated or human critique. Nonmonotonic reasoning, crucial to human cognition for navigating the real world, remains a challenging, yet understudied task. In this work, we study nonmonotonic reasoning capabilities of seven state-of-the-art LLMs in one abstract and one commonsense reasoning task featuring generics, such as 'Birds fly', and exceptions, 'Penguins don't fly' (see Fig. 1). While LLMs exhibit reasoning patterns in accordance with human nonmonotonic reasoning abilities, they fail to maintain stable beliefs on truth conditions of generics at the addition of supporting examples ('Owls fly') or unrelated information ('Lions have manes').Our findings highlight pitfalls in attributing human reasoning behaviours to LLMs as long as consistent reasoning remains elusive.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.51	Alina Leidinger, Robert Van Rooij, Ekaterina Shutova
Naming, Describing, and Quantifying Visual Objects in Humans and LLMs	While human speakers use a variety of different expressions when describing the same object in an image, giving rise to a distribution of plausible labels driven by pragmatic constraints, the extent to which current Vision & Language Large Language Models (VLLMs) can mimic this crucial feature of language use is an open question. This applies to common, everyday objects, but it is particularly interesting for uncommon or novel objects for which a category label may be lacking or fuzzy. Furthermore, similar patterns of variation are observed among human speakers for highly context-sensitive expressions, such as the quantifiers 'few' or 'most'. In our work, we evaluate VLLMs (FROMAGe, BLIP-2, LLaVA) on three categories (nouns, attributes, and quantifiers) where humans show great subjective variability concerning the distribution over plausible labels, using datasets and resources mostly under-explored in previous work. Our results reveal mixed evidence on the ability of VLLMs to capture human naming preferences at generation time: while some models are good at mimicking human distributions for nouns and attributes, all of them fail to assign quantifiers, a task that requires more accurate, high-level reasoning.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.50	Alberto Testoni, Juell Sprott, Sandro Pezzelle
The Probabilities Also Matter: A More Faithful Metric for Faithfulness of Free-Text Explanations in Large Language Models	"In order to oversee advanced AI systems, it is important to understand their reasons for generating a given output. When prompted, large language models (LLMs) can provide natural language explanations or reasoning traces that sound plausible and receive high ratings from human annotators. However, it is unclear to what extent these explanations are truly capturing the factors responsible for the model's predictions: the most ""human-like"" explanation may be different from the one that is most faithful to the model's true decision making process. In this work, we introduce the correlational counterfactual test (CCT), a faithfulness metric based on counterfactual input edits that takes into account not just the binary label change, but the total shift in the model's predicted label distribution. We evaluate the faithfulness of free-text explanations generated by few-shot-prompted LLMs from the Llama-2 family on three NLP tasks. We find that these explanations are indeed more likely to mention factors when they are impactful to the model's prediction, with the degree of association increasing with model size but varying significantly by task."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.49	Noah Siegel, Oana-Maria Camburu, Nicolas Heess, Maria Perez-Ortiz
Shoulders of Giants: A Look at the Degree and Utility of Openness in NLP Research	We analysed a sample of NLP research papers archived in ACL Anthology as an attempt to quantify the degree of openness and the benefit of such an open culture in the NLP community. We observe that papers published in different NLP venues show different patterns related to artefact reuse. We also note that more than 30% of the papers we analysed do not release their artefacts publicly. Further, we observe a wide language-wise disparity in publicly available NLP-related artefacts.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.48	Surangika Ranathunga, Nisansa De Silva, Dilith Jayakody, Aloka Fernando
AGR: Reinforced Causal Agent-Guided Self-explaining Rationalization	Most existing rationalization approaches are susceptible to degeneration accumulation due to a lack of effective control over the learning direction of the model during training. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach AGR (Agent-Guided Rationalization), guiding the next action of the model based on its current training state. Specifically, we introduce causal intervention calculus to quantify the causal effects inherent during rationale training, and utilize reinforcement learning process to refine the learning bias of them. Furthermore, we pretrain an agent within this reinforced causal environment to guide the next step of the model. We theoretically demonstrate that a good model needs the desired guidance, and empirically show the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods on BeerAdvocate and HotelReview datasets.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.47	Yunxiao Zhao, Zhiqiang Wang, Xiaoli Li, Jiye Liang, Ru Li
IndicIRSuite: Multilingual Dataset and Neural Information Models for Indian Languages	In this paper, we introduce Neural Information Retrieval resources for 11 widely spoken Indian Languages (Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, and Telugu) from two major Indian language families (Indo-Aryan and Dravidian). These resources include (a) INDIC-MARCO, a multilingual version of the MS MARCO dataset in 11 Indian Languages created using Machine Translation, and (b) Indic-ColBERT, a collection of 11 distinct Monolingual Neural Information Retrieval models, each trained on one of the 11 languages in the INDIC-MARCO dataset. To the best of our knowledge, IndicIRSuite is the first attempt at building large-scale Neural Information Retrieval resources for a large number of Indian languages, and we hope that it will help accelerate research in Neural IR for Indian Languages. Experiments demonstrate that Indic-ColBERT achieves 47.47% improvement in the MRR@10 score averaged over the INDIC-MARCO baselines for all 11 Indian languages except Oriya, 12.26% improvement in the NDCG@10 score averaged over the MIRACL Bengali and Hindi Language baselines, and 20% improvement in the MRR@100 Score over the Mr. Tydi Bengali Language baseline.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.46	Saiful Haq, Ashutosh Sharma, Omar Khattab, Niyati Chhaya, Pushpak Bhattacharyya
Fine-Tuned Machine Translation Metrics Struggle in Unseen Domains	We introduce a new, extensive multidimensional quality metrics (MQM) annotated dataset covering 11 language pairs in the biomedical domain. We use this dataset to investigate whether machine translation (MT) metrics which are fine-tuned on human-generated MT quality judgements are robust to domain shifts between training and inference. We find that fine-tuned metrics exhibit a substantial performance drop in the unseen domain scenario relative to both metrics that rely on the surface form and pre-trained metrics that are not fine-tuned on MT quality judgments.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.45	Vilém Zouhar, Shuoyang Ding, Anna Currey, Tatyana Badeka, Jenyuan Wang, Brian Thompson
An Empirical Analysis on Large Language Models in Debate Evaluation	In this study, we investigate the capabilities and inherent biases of advanced large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in the context of debate evaluation. We discover that LLM's performance exceeds humans and surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods fine-tuned on extensive datasets. We additionally explore and analyze biases present in LLMs, including positional bias, lexical bias, order bias, which may affect their evaluative judgments. Our findings reveal a consistent bias in both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 towards the second candidate response presented, attributed to prompt design. We also uncover a lexical bias in both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, especially when label sets carry connotations such as numerical or sequential, highlighting the critical need for careful label verbalizer selection in prompt design. Additionally, our analysis indicates a tendency of both models to favor the debate's concluding side as the winner, suggesting an end-of-discussion bias.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.44	Xinyi Liu, Pinxin Liu, Hangfeng He
MaskLID: Code-Switching Language Identification through Iterative Masking	We present MaskLID, a simple, yet effective, code-switching (CS) language identification (LID) method. MaskLID does not require any training and is designed to complement current high-performance sentence-level LIDs. Sentence-level LIDs are classifiers trained on monolingual texts to provide single labels, typically using a softmax layer to turn scores into probabilities. However, in cases where a sentence is composed in both L1 and L2 languages, the LID classifier often only returns the dominant label L1. To address this limitation, MaskLID employs a strategy to mask text features associated with L1, allowing the LID to classify the text as L2 in the next round. This method uses the LID itself to identify the features that require masking and does not rely on any external resource. In this work, we explore the use of MaskLID for two open-source LIDs (GlotLID and OpenLID), that are both based on the FastText architecture. Code and demo are available at https://github.com/cisnlp/MaskLID.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.43	Amir Hossein Kargaran, François Yvon, Hinrich Schuetze
DocFinQA: A Long-Context Financial Reasoning Dataset	For large language models (LLMs) to be effective in the financial domain – where each decision can have a significant impact – it is necessary to investigate realistic tasks and data. Financial professionals often interact with documents spanning hundreds of pages, but most financial research datasets only deal with short excerpts from these documents. To address this, we introduce a long-document financial QA task. We augment 7,437 questions from the existing FinQA dataset with full-document context, extending the average context length from under 700 words in FinQA to 123k words in DocFinQA. We conduct extensive experiments over retrieval-based QA pipelines and long-context language models. Based on our experiments, DocFinQA proves a significant challenge for even state-of-the-art systems. We also provide a case study on a subset of the longest documents in DocFinQA and find that models particularly struggle with these documents. Addressing these challenges may have a wide-reaching impact across applications where specificity and long-range contexts are critical, like gene sequences and legal document contract analysis. DocFinQA dataset is publicly accessible.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.42	Varshini Reddy, Rik Koncel-Kedziorski, Viet Lai, Michael Krumdick, Charles Lovering, Chris Tanner
STREAM: Simplified Topic Retrieval, Exploration, and Analysis Module	Topic modeling is a widely used technique to analyze large document corpora. With the ever-growing emergence of scientific contributions in the field, non-technical users may often use the simplest available software module, independent of whether there are potentially better models available. We present a Simplified Topic Retrieval, Exploration, and Analysis Module (STREAM) for user-friendly topic modelling and especially subsequent interactive topic visualization and analysis. For better topic analysis, we implement multiple intruder-word based topic evaluation metrics. Additionally, we publicize multiple new datasets that can extend the so far very limited number of publicly available benchmark datasets in topic modeling. We integrate downstream interpretable analysis modules to enable users to easily analyse the created topics in downstream tasks together with additional tabular information.The code is available at the following link: https://github.com/AnFreTh/STREAM	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.41	Anton Thielmann, Arik Reuter, Christoph Weisser, Gillian Kant, Manish Kumar, Benjamin Säfken
Sign Language Translation with Sentence Embedding Supervision	State-of-the-art sign language translation (SLT) systems facilitate the learning process through gloss annotations, either in an end2end manner or by involving an intermediate step. Unfortunately, gloss labelled sign language data is usually not available at scale and, when available, gloss annotations widely differ from dataset to dataset. We present a novel approach using sentence embeddings of the target sentences at training time that take the role of glosses. The new kind of supervision does not need any manual annotation but it is learned on raw textual data. As our approach easily facilitates multilinguality, we evaluate it on datasets covering German (PHOENIX-2014T) and American (How2Sign) sign languages and experiment with mono- and multilingual sentence embeddings and translation systems. Our approach significantly outperforms other gloss-free approaches, setting the new state-of-the-art for data sets where glosses are not available and when no additional SLT datasets are used for pretraining, diminishing the gap between gloss-free and gloss-dependent systems.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.40	Yasser Hamidullah, Josef van Genabith, Cristina España-Bonet
Born Differently Makes a Difference: Counterfactual Study of Bias in Biography Generation from a Data-to-Text Perspective	How do personal attributes affect biography generation? Addressing this question requires an identical pair of biographies where only the personal attributes of interest are different. However, it is rare in the real world. To address this, we propose a counterfactual methodology from a data-to-text perspective, manipulating the personal attributes of interest while keeping the co-occurring attributes unchanged. We first validate that the fine-tuned Flan-T5 model generates the biographies based on the given attributes. This work expands the analysis of gender-centered bias in text generation. Our results confirm the well-known bias in gender and also show the bias in regions, in both individual and its related co-occurring attributes in semantic machining and sentiment.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.39	Biaoyan Fang, Ritvik Dinesh, Xiang Dai, Sarvnaz Karimi
Explainability and Hate Speech: Structured Explanations Make Social Media Moderators Faster	Content moderators play a key role in keeping the conversation on social media healthy. While the high volume of content they need to judge represents a bottleneck to the moderation pipeline, no studies have explored how models could support them to make faster decisions. There is, by now, a vast body of research into detecting hate speech, sometimes explicitly motivated by a desire to help improve content moderation, but published research using real content moderators is scarce. In this work we investigate the effect of explanations on the speed of real-world moderators. Our experiments show that while generic explanations do not affect their speed and are often ignored, structured explanations lower moderators' decision making time by 7.4%.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.38	Agostina Calabrese, Leonardo Neves, Neil Shah, Maarten Bos, Björn Ross, Mirella Lapata, Francesco Barbieri
Do Large Language Models Discriminate in Hiring Decisions on the Basis of Race, Ethnicity, and Gender?	We examine whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit race- and gender-based name discrimination in hiring decisions, similar to classic findings in the social sciences (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004). We design a series of templatic prompts to LLMs to write an email to a named job applicant informing them of a hiring decision. By manipulating the applicant's first name, we measure the effect of perceived race, ethnicity, and gender on the probability that the LLM generates an acceptance or rejection email. We find that the hiring decisions of LLMs in many settings are more likely to favor White applicants over Hispanic applicants. In aggregate, the groups with the highest and lowest acceptance rates respectively are masculine White names and masculine Hispanic names. However, the comparative acceptance rates by group vary under different templatic settings, suggesting that LLMs' race- and gender-sensitivity may be idiosyncratic and prompt-sensitive.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.37	Haozhe An, Christabel Acquaye, Colin Wang, Zongxia Li, Rachel Rudinger
That’s Optional: A Contemporary Exploration of “that” Omission in English Subordinate Clauses	"The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis posits that speakers optimize the communicative properties of their utterances by avoiding spikes in information, thereby maintaining a relatively uniform information profile over time. This paper investigates the impact of UID principles on syntactic reduction, specifically focusing on the optional omission of the connector ""that"" in English subordinate clauses. Building upon previous research, we extend our investigation to a larger corpus of written English, utilize contemporary large language models (LLMs) and extend the information-uniformity principles by the notion of entropy, to estimate the UID manifestations in the usecase of syntactic reduction choices."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.36	Ella Rabinovich
Dwell in the Beginning: How Language Models Embed Long Documents for Dense Retrieval	This study investigates the existence of positional biases in Transformer-based language models for text representation learning, particularly in the context of web document retrieval. We build on previous research that demonstrated loss of information in the middle of input sequences for causal language models, extending it to the domain of embedding learning. We examine positional biases at multiple stages of the training pipeline for an encoder-decoder neural retrieval model, namely language model pre-training, contrastive pre-training, and contrastive fine-tuning. Experiments with the MS-MARCO document collection reveal that after contrastive pre-training the model already generates embeddings that better capture the beginning of the input content, with fine-tuning further aggravating this effect.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.35	João Coelho, Bruno Martins, Joao Magalhaes, Jamie Callan, Chenyan Xiong
Understanding the Effects of Noise in Text-to-SQL: An Examination of the BIRD-Bench Benchmark	Text-to-SQL, which involves translating natural language into Structured Query Language (SQL), is crucial for enabling broad access to structured databases without expert knowledge. However, designing models for such tasks is challenging due to numerous factors, including the presence of noise, such as ambiguous questions and syntactical errors. This study provides an in-depth analysis of the distribution and types of noise in the widely used BIRD-Bench benchmark and the impact of noise on models. While BIRD-Bench was created to model dirty and noisy database values, it was not created to contain noise and errors in the questions and gold SQL queries. We found that noise in questions and gold queries are prevalent in the dataset, with varying amounts across domains, and with an uneven distribution between noise types. The presence of incorrect gold SQL queries, which then generate incorrect gold answers, has a significant impact on the benchmark's reliability. Surprisingly, when evaluating models on corrected SQL queries, zero-shot baselines surpassed the performance of state-of-the-art prompting methods. We conclude that informative noise labels and reliable benchmarks are crucial to developing new Text-to-SQL methods that can handle varying types of noise.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.34	Niklas Wretblad, Fredrik Riseby, Rahul Biswas, Amin Ahmadi, Oskar Holmström
EmbSpatial-Bench: Benchmarking Spatial Understanding for Embodied Tasks with Large Vision-Language Models	The recent rapid development of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has indicated their potential for embodied tasks. However, the critical skill of spatial understanding in embodied environments has not been thoroughly evaluated, leaving the gap between current LVLMs and qualified embodied intelligence unknown. Therefore, we construct EmbSpatial-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating embodied spatial understanding of LVLMs. The benchmark is automatically derived from embodied scenes and covers 6 spatial relationships from an egocentric perspective. Experiments expose the insufficient capacity of current LVLMs (even GPT-4V). We further present EmbSpatial-SFT, an instruction-tuning dataset designed to improve LVLMs' embodied spatial understanding.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.33	Mengfei Du, Binhao Wu, Zejun Li, Xuanjing Huang, Zhongyu Wei
ATLAS: Improving Lay Summarisation with Attribute-based Control	"Lay summarisation aims to produce summaries of scientific articles that are comprehensible to non-expert audiences. However, previous work assumes a one-size-fits-all approach, where the content and style of the produced summary are entirely dependent on the data used to train the model. In practice, audiences with different levels of expertise will have specific needs, impacting what content should appear in a lay summary and how it should be presented. Aiming to address this, we propose ATLAS, a novel abstractive summarisation approach that can control various properties that contribute to the overall ""layness"" of the generated summary using targeted control attributes. We evaluate ATLAS on a combination of biomedical lay summarisation datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines using mainstream summarisation metrics.Additional analyses provided on the discriminatory power and emergent influence of our selected controllable attributes further attest to the effectiveness of our approach."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.32	Zhihao Zhang, Tomas Goldsack, Carolina Scarton, Chenghua Lin
What Does Parameter-free Probing Really Uncover?	"Supervised approaches to probing large language models (LLMs) have been criticized of using pre-defined theory-laden target labels. As an alternative, parameter-free probing constructs structural representations bottom-up via information derived from the LLM alone. This has been suggested to capture a genuine ""LLM-internal grammar"". However, its relation to familiar linguistic formalisms remains unclear. I extend prior work on a parameter-free probing technique called perturbed masking applied to BERT, by comparing its results to the Universal Dependencies (UD) formalism for English. The results highlight several major discrepancies between BERT and UD, which lack correlates in linguistic theory. This raises the question of whether human grammar is the correct analogy to interpret BERT in the first place."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.31	Tommi Buder-Gröndahl
MTP: A Dataset for Multi-Modal Turning Points in Casual Conversations	Detecting critical moments, such as emotional outbursts or changes in decisions during conversations, is crucial for understanding shifts in human behavior and their consequences. Our work introduces a novel problem setting focusing on these moments as turning points (TPs), accompanied by a meticulously curated, high-consensus, human-annotated multi-modal dataset. We provide precise timestamps, descriptions, and visual-textual evidence high-lighting changes in emotions, behaviors, perspectives, and decisions at these turning points. We also propose a framework, TPMaven, utilizing state-of-the-art vision-language models to construct a narrative from the videos and large language models to classify and detect turning points in our multi-modal dataset. Evaluation results show that TPMaven achieves an F1-score of 0.88 in classification and 0.61 in detection, with additional explanations aligning with human expectations.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.30	Gia-Bao Ho, Chang Tan, Zahra Darban, Mahsa Salehi, Reza Haf, Wray Buntine

Soft Self-Consistency Improves Language Models Agents	"Generations from large language models (LLMs) can be improved by sampling and scoring multiple solutions to select a final answer. Current ""sample and select"" methods such as self-consistency (SC) rely on majority voting to score answers. However, when tasks have many distinct and valid answers, selection by voting requires a large number of samples. This makes SC prohibitively expensive for interactive tasks that involve generating multiple actions (answers) sequentially. After establishing that majority voting fails to provide consistent gains on such tasks, we demonstrate how to increase success rates by softening the scoring criterion. We introduce Soft Self-Consistency (SOFT-SC), which replaces SC's discontinuous scoring with a continuous score computed from model likelihoods, allowing for selection even when actions are sparsely distributed. SOFT-SC improves both performance and efficiency on long-horizon interactive tasks, requiring half as many samples as SC for comparable or better performance. For a fixed number of samples, SOFT-SC leads to a 1.3% increase over SC in absolute success rate on writing bash programs, a 6.6% increase on online shopping (WebShop), and a 4.7% increase for an interactive household game (ALFWorld). Finally, we show that SOFT-SC can be applied to both open-source and black-box models."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.28	Han Wang, Archiki Prasad, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal
Generating Harder Cross-document Event Coreference Resolution Datasets using Metaphoric Paraphrasing	The most popular Cross-Document Event Coreference Resolution (CDEC) datasets fail to convey the true difficulty of the task, due to the lack of lexical diversity between coreferring event triggers (words or phrases that refer to an event). Furthermore, there is a dearth of event datasets for figurative language, limiting a crucial avenue of research in event comprehension. We address these two issues by introducing ECB+META, a lexically rich variant of Event Coref Bank Plus (ECB+) for CDEC on symbolic and metaphoric language. We use ChatGPT as a tool for the metaphoric transformation of sentences in the documents of ECB+, then tag the original event triggers in the transformed sentences in a semi-automated manner. In this way, we avoid the re-annotation of expensive coreference links. We present results that show existing methods that work well on ECB+ struggle with ECB+META, thereby paving the way for CDEC research on a much more challenging dataset.

Is the Pope Catholic? Yes, the Pope is Catholic. Generative Evaluation of Non-Literal Intent Resolution in LLMs	Humans often express their communicative intents indirectly or non-literally, which requires their interlocutors—human or AI—to understand beyond the literal meaning of words. While most existing work has focused on discriminative evaluations, we present a new approach to generatively evaluate large language models' (LLMs') intention understanding by examining their responses to non-literal utterances. Ideally, an LLM should respond in line with the true intention of a non-literal utterance, not its literal interpretation. Our findings show that LLMs struggle to generate contextually relevant responses to non-literal language. We also find that providing oracle intentions substantially improves response appropriateness, but using chain-of-thought to make models spell out intentions before responding improves much less. These findings suggest that LLMs are not yet pragmatic interlocutors, and that explicitly modeling intention could improve LLM responses to non-literal language.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.26	Akhila Yerukola, Saujas Vaduguru, Daniel Fried, Maarten Sap
On the Semantic Latent Space of Diffusion-Based Text-To-Speech Models	The incorporation of Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) in the Text-to-Speech (TTS) domain is rising, providing great value in synthesizing high quality speech. Although they exhibit impressive audio quality, the extent of their semantic capabilities is unknown, and controlling their synthesized speech's vocal properties remains a challenge. Inspired by recent advances in image synthesis, we explore the latent space of frozen TTS models, which is composed of the latent bottleneck activations of the DDM's denoiser. We identify that this space contains rich semantic information, and outline several novel methods for finding semantic directions within it, both supervised and unsupervised. We then demonstrate how these enable off-the-shelf audio editing, without any further training, architectural changes or data requirements. We present evidence of the semantic and acoustic qualities of the edited audio, and provide supplemental samples: https://latent-analysis-grad-tts.github.io/speech-samples/.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.24	Miri Varshavsky-Hassid, Roy Hirsch, Regev Cohen, Tomer Golany, Daniel Freedman, Ehud Rivlin
Learnable Privacy Neurons Localization in Language Models	Concerns regarding Large Language Models (LLMs) to memorize and disclose private information, particularly Personally Identifiable Information (PII), become prominent within the community. Many efforts have been made to mitigate the privacy risks.However, the mechanism through which LLMs memorize PII remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we introduce a pioneering method for pinpointing PII-sensitive neurons (privacy neurons) within LLMs. Our method employs learnable binary weight masks to localize specific neurons that account for the memorization of PII in LLMs through adversarial training. Our investigations discover that PII is memorized by a small subset of neurons across all layers, which shows the property of PII specificity. Furthermore, we propose to validate the potential in PII risk mitigation by deactivating the localized privacy neurons. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our neuron localization algorithm.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.25	Ruizhe Chen, Tianxiang Hu, Yang Feng, Zuozhu Liu
Sketch-Guided Constrained Decoding for Boosting Blackbox Large Language Models without Logit Access	"Constrained decoding, a technique for enforcing constraints on language model outputs, offers a way to control text generation without retraining or architectural modifications. Its application is, however, typically restricted to models that give users access to next-token distributions (usually via softmax logits), which poses a limitation with blackbox large language models (LLMs). This paper introduces sketch-guided constrained decoding (SketchGCD), a novel approach to constrained decoding for blackbox LLMs, which operates without access to the logits of the blackbox LLM. SketchGCD utilizes a locally hosted auxiliary model to refine the output of an unconstrained blackbox LLM, effectively treating this initial output as a ""sketch"" for further elaboration. This approach is complementary to traditional logit-based techniques and enables the application of constrained decoding in settings where full model transparency is unavailable. We demonstrate the efficacy of SketchGCD through experiments in closed information extraction and constituency parsing, showing how it enhances the utility and flexibility of blackbox LLMs for complex NLP tasks."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.23	Saibo Geng, Berkay Döner, Chris Wendler, Martin Josifoski, Robert West
Growing Trees on Sounds: Assessing Strategies for End-to-End Dependency Parsing of Speech	Direct dependency parsing of the speech signal –as opposed to parsing speech transcriptions– has recently been proposed as a task (Pupier et al. 2022), as a way of incorporating prosodic information in the parsing system and bypassing the limitations of a pipeline approach that would consist of using first an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system and then a syntactic parser. In this article, we report on a set of experiments aiming at assessing the performance of two parsing paradigms (graph-based parsing and sequence labeling based parsing) on speech parsing. We perform this evaluation on a large treebank of spoken French, featuring realistic spontaneous conversations. Our findings show that (i) the graph based approach obtain better results across the board (ii) parsing directly from speech outperforms a pipeline approach, despite having 30% fewer parameters.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.22	Adrien Pupier, Maximin Coavoux, Jérôme Goulian, Benjamin Lecouteux
Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Language Models with Gaze Supervision	Human gaze data provide cognitive information that reflect human language comprehension and has been effectively integrated into a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, demonstrating improved performance over corresponding plain text-based models. In this work, we propose to integrate a gaze module into pre-trained language models (LMs) at the fine-tuning stage to improve their capabilities to learn representations that are grounded in human language processing. This is done by extending the conventional purely text-based fine-tuning objective with an auxiliary loss to exploit cognitive signals. The gaze module is only included during training, retaining compatibility with existing pre-trained LM-based pipelines. We evaluate the proposed approach using two distinct pre-trained LMs on the GLUE benchmark and observe that the proposed model improves performance compared to both standard fine-tuning and traditional text augmentation baselines.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.21	Shuwen Deng, Paul Prasse, David Reich, Tobias Scheffer, Lena Jäger
DynaSemble: Dynamic Ensembling of Textual and Structure-Based Models for Knowledge Graph Completion	We consider two popular approaches to KnowledgeGraph Completion (KGC): textual modelsthat rely on textual entity descriptions, andstructure-based models that exploit the connectivitystructure of the Knowledge Graph(KG). Preliminary experiments show that theseapproaches have complementary strengths:structure-based models perform exceptionallywell when the gold answer is easily reachablefrom the query head in the KG, while textualmodels exploit descriptions to give goodperformance even when the gold answer isnot easily reachable. In response, we proposeDynaSemble, a novel method for learningquery-dependent ensemble weights to combinethese approaches by using the distributions ofscores assigned by the models in the ensembleto all candidate entities. DynaSemble achievesstate-of-the-art results on three standard KGCdatasets, with up to 6.8 pt MRR and 8.3 ptHits@1 gains over the best baseline model forthe WN18RR dataset.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.20	Ananjan Nandi, Navdeep Kaur, Parag Singla, Mausam .
Two Issues with Chinese Spelling Correction and A Refinement Solution	The Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) task aims to detect and correct misspelled characters in Chinese text, and has received lots of attention in the past few years. Most recent studies adopt a Transformer-based model and leverage different features of characters such as pronunciation, glyph and contextual information to enhance the model's ability to complete the task. Despite their state-of-the-art performance, we observe two issues that should be addressed to further advance the CSC task. First, the widely-used benchmark datasets SIGHAN13, SIGHAN14 and SIGHAN15, contain many mistakes. Hence the performance of existing models is not accurate and should be re-evaluated. Second, existing models seem to have reached a performance bottleneck, where the improvements on the SIGHAN's testing sets are increasingly smaller and unstable. To deal with the two issues, we make two contributions: (1) we manually fix the SIGHAN datasets and re-evaluate four representative CSC models using the fixed datasets; (2) we analyze the new results to identify the spelling errors that none of the four models successfully corrects, based on which we propose a simple yet effective refinement solution. Experimental results show that our solution improves the four models in all metrics by notable margins.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.19	Changxuan Sun, Linlin She, Xuesong Lu
DDPrompt: Differential Diversity Prompting in Large Language Models	Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that their reasoning ability could be enhanced through approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, these methods use single prompts for different types of questions and do not design appropriate prompts for questions with different characteristics. In this paper, we aim to explore a methodology that generates differentially diverse reasoning paths for different types of questions. To achieve this, we propose a novel prompting strategy called Differential Diversity Prompting (DDPrompt). Firstly, we generate the optimal prompts collection based on question characteristics. Then, we use this optimal prompts collection to generate multiple answers for a question and choose the final answer by voting. We evaluated DDPrompt on twelve reasoning benchmarks and significant improvement in the performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K 75%->84%, Tracking Shuffled Objects (68.8%->83.9%))	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.17	Lin Mu, Wenhao Zhang, Yiwen Zhang, Peiquan Jin
AFLoRA: Adaptive Freezing of Low Rank Adaptation in Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Models	We present a novel Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, dubbed as Adaptive Freezing of Low-Rank Adaptation (AFLoRA). Specifically, for each pre-trained frozen weight tensor, we add a parallel path of trainable low-rank matrices, namely a down-projection and an up-projection matrix, each of which is followed by a feature transformation vector. Based on a novel freezing score, we incrementally freeze these projection matrices during fine-tuning to reduce the computation and alleviate over-fitting. Our experimental results demonstrate that we can achieve state-of-the-art performance with an average improvement of up to 0.85% as evaluated on the GLUE benchmark while yielding up to 9.5× fewer average trainable parameters. While compared in terms of runtime, AFLoRA can yield up to 1.86× improvement as opposed to similar PEFT alternatives. Besides the practical utility of our approach, we provide insights on the trainability requirements of LoRA paths at different modules and the freezing schedule for the different projection matrices.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.16	Zeyu Liu, Souvik Kundu, Anni Li, Junrui Wan, Lianghao Jiang, Peter Beerel
Monotonic Representation of Numeric Attributes in Language Models	"Language models (LMs) can express factual knowledge involving numeric properties such as Karl Popper was born in 1902. However, how this information is encoded in the model's internal representations is not understood well. Here, we introduce a method for finding and editing representations of numeric properties such as an entity's birth year. We find directions that encode numeric properties monotonically, in an interpretable fashion. When editing representations along these directions, LM output changes accordingly. For example, by patching activations along a ""birthyear"" direction we can make the LM express an increasingly late birthyear. Property-encoding directions exist across several numeric properties in all models under consideration, suggesting the possibility that monotonic representation of numeric properties consistently emerges during LM pretraining.Code: https://github.com/bheinzerling/numeric-property-reprA long version of this short paper is available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10381"	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.18	Benjamin Heinzerling, Kentaro Inui
Code-Switching Can be Better Aligners: Advancing Cross-Lingual SLU through Representation-Level and Prediction-Level Alignment	Zero-shot cross-lingual spoken language understanding (SLU) can promote the globalization application of dialog systems, which has attracted increasing attention. While current code-switching based cross-lingual SLU frameworks have shown promising results, they (i) predominantly utilize contrastive objectives to model hard alignment, which may disrupt the inherent structure within sentences of each language; and (ii) focus optimization objectives solely on the original sentences, neglecting the relation between original sentences and code-switched sentences, which may hinder contextualized embeddings from further alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework dubbed REPE (short for Representation-Level and Prediction-Level Alignment), which leverages both code-switched and original sentences to achieve multi-level alignment. Specifically, REPE introduces optimal transport to facilitate soft alignment between the representations of code-switched and original sentences, thereby preserving structural integrity as much as possible. Moreover, REPE adopts multi-view learning to enforce consistency regularization between the prediction of the two sentences, aligning them into a more refined language-invariant space. Based on this, we further incorporate a self-distillation layer to boost the robustness of REPE. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks across ten languages demonstrate the superiority of the proposed REPE framework.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.15	Zhihong Zhu, Xuxin Cheng, Zhanpeng Chen, Xianwei Zhuang, Zhiqi Huang, Yuexian Zou
Bi-Directional Multi-Granularity Generation Framework for Knowledge Graph-to-Text with Large Language Model	The knowledge graph-to-text (KG-to-text) generation task aims to synthesize coherent and engaging sentences that accurately convey the complex information derived from an input knowledge graph. Existing methods generate the whole target text based on all KG triples at once and may incorporate incorrect KG triples for each sentence. To this end, we propose the bi-directional multi-granularity generation framework. Instead of generating the whole text at a time, we construct the sentence level generation based on the corresponding triples and generate the graph-level text as a result. Moreover, we design a backward relation extraction task to enhance the correctness of relational information. Our method achieves the new state-of-the-art in benchmark dataset WebNLG and further analysis shows the efficiency of different modules.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.14	Haowei Du, Chen Li, Dinghao Zhang, Dongyan Zhao
IEPile: Unearthing Large Scale Schema-Conditioned Information Extraction Corpus	Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable potential across various domains; however, they exhibit a significant performance gap in Information Extraction (IE). Note that high-quality instruction data is the vital key for enhancing the specific capabilities of LLMs, while current IE datasets tend to be small in scale, fragmented, and lack standardized schema. To this end, we introduce IEPile, a comprehensive bilingual (English and Chinese) IE instruction corpus, which contains approximately 0.32B tokens. We construct IEPile by collecting and cleaning 33 existing IE datasets, and introduce schema-based instruction generation to unearth a large-scale corpus. Experimentally, IEPile enhance the performance of LLMs for IE, with notable improvements in zero-shot generalization. We open-source the resource and pre-trained models, hoping to provide valuable support to the NLP community.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.13	Honghao Gui, Lin Yuan, Hongbin Ye, Ningyu Zhang, Mengshu Sun, Lei Liang, Huajun Chen
On the Role of Long-tail Knowledge in Retrieval Augmented Large Language Models	"Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) exhibits outstanding performance in promoting the knowledge capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with retrieved documents related to user queries. However, RAG only focuses on improving the response quality of LLMs via enhancing queries indiscriminately with retrieved information, paying little attention to what type of knowledge LLMs really need to answer original queries more accurately. In this paper, we suggest that long-tail knowledge is crucial for RAG as LLMs have already remembered common world knowledge during large-scale pre-training. Based on our observation, we propose a simple but effective long-tail knowledge detection method for LLMs. Specifically, the novel Generative Expected Calibration Error (GECE) metric is derived to measure the ""long-tailness"" of knowledge based on both statistics and semantics. Hence, we retrieve relevant documents and infuse them into the model for patching knowledge loopholes only when the input query relates to long-tail knowledge. Experiments show that, compared to existing RAG pipelines, our method achieves over 4x speedup in average inference time and consistent performance improvement in downstream tasks."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.12	Dongyang Li, Junbing Yan, Taolin Zhang, Chengyu Wang, Xiaofeng He, Longtao Huang, Hui Xue’, Jun Huang
SceMQA: A Scientific College Entrance Level Multimodal Question Answering Benchmark	The paper introduces SceMQA, a novel benchmark for scientific multimodal question answering at the college entrance level. It addresses a critical educational phase often overlooked in existing benchmarks, spanning high school to pre-college levels. SceMQA focuses on core science subjects including Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. It features a blend of multiple-choice and free-response formats, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of AI models' abilities. Additionally, our benchmark provides specific knowledge points for each problem and detailed explanations for each answer. SceMQA also uniquely presents problems with identical contexts but varied questions to facilitate a more thorough and accurate assessment of reasoning capabilities. In the experiment, we evaluate both open-source and close-source state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), across various experimental settings. The results show that further research and development are needed in developing more capable MLLM, as highlighted by only 50% to 60% accuracy achieved by the strongest models.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.11	Zhenwen Liang, Kehan Guo, Gang Liu, Taicheng Guo, Yujun Zhou, Tianyu Yang, Jiajun Jiao, Renjie Pi, Jipeng Zhang, Xiangliang Zhang

UltraSparseBERT selectively engages just 12 out of 4095 neurons for each layer inference. This is achieved by reorganizing feedforward networks into fast feedforward networks (FFFs).To showcase but one benefit of high sparsity, we provide an Intel MKL implementation achieving 78x speedup over the optimized feedforward baseline on CPUs, and an OpenAI Triton implementation performing forward passes 4.1x faster than the corresponding native GPU implementation.

Simpson’s Paradox and the Accuracy-Fluency Tradeoff in Translation	A good translation should be faithful to the source and should respect the norms of the target language. We address a theoretical puzzle about the relationship between these objectives. On one hand, intuition and some prior work suggest that accuracy and fluency should trade off against each other, and that capturing every detail of the source can only be achieved at the cost of fluency. On the other hand, quality assessment researchers often suggest that accuracy and fluency are highly correlated and difficult for human raters to distinguish (Callison-Burch et al., 2007). We show that the tension between these views is an instance of Simpson's paradox, and that accuracy and fluency are positively correlated at the level of the corpus but trade off at the level of individual source segments. We further suggest that the relationship between accuracy and fluency is best evaluated at the segment (or sentence) level, and that the trade off between these dimensions has implications both for assessing translation quality and developing improved MT systems.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.9	Zheng Wei Lim, Ekaterina Vylomova, Trevor Cohn, Charles Kemp
Language Models Do Hard Arithmetic Tasks Easily and Hardly Do Easy Arithmetic Tasks	The ability (and inability) of large language models (LLMs) to perform arithmetic tasks has been the subject of much theoretical and practical debate. We show that LLMs are frequently able to correctly and confidently predict the first digit of n -digit by m -digit multiplication tasks without using chain of thought reasoning, despite these tasks require compounding operations to solve. Simultaneously, LLMs in practice often fail to correctly or confidently predict the last digit of an n -digit by m -digit multiplication, a task equivalent to 1-digit by 1-digit multiplication which can be easily learned or memorized. We show that the latter task can be solved more robustly when the LLM is conditioned on all of the correct higher-order digits, which on average increases the confidence of the correct last digit on 5-digit by 5-digit multiplication tasks using Llama 2-13B by over 230% (0.13→0.43) and Mistral-7B by 150% (0.22→0.55).	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.8	Andrew Gambardella, Yusuke Iwasawa, Yutaka Matsuo
Isotropy, Clusters, and Classifiers	Whether embedding spaces use all their dimensions equally, i.e., whether they are isotropic, has been a recent subject of discussion. Evidence has been accrued both for and against enforcing isotropy in embedding spaces. In the present paper, we stress that isotropy imposes requirements on the embedding space that are not compatible with the presence of clusters—which also negatively impacts linear classification objectives. We demonstrate this fact both empirically and mathematically and use it to shed light on previous results from the literature.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.7	Timothee Mickus, Stig-Arne Grönroos, Joseph Attieh
RDRec: Rationale Distillation for LLM-based Recommendation	Large language model (LLM)-based recommender models that bridge users and items through textual prompts for effective semantic reasoning have gained considerable attention. However, few methods consider the underlying rationales behind interactions, such as user preferences and item attributes, limiting the reasoning ability of LLMs for recommendations. This paper proposes a rationale distillation recommender (RDRec), a compact model designed to learn rationales generated by a larger language model (LM). By leveraging rationales from reviews related to users and items, RDRec remarkably specifies their profiles for recommendations. Experiments show that RDRec achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both top-N and sequential recommendations.

Speculative Contrastive Decoding	Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance in language tasks, yet their auto-regressive inference is limited due to high computational requirements and is sub-optimal due to the exposure bias. Inspired by speculative decoding and contrastive decoding, we introduce Speculative Contrastive Decoding (SCD), a straightforward yet powerful decoding approach that leverages predictions from smaller language models (LMs) to achieve both decoding acceleration and quality improvement. Extensive evaluations and analyses on four diverse language tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of SCD, showing that decoding efficiency and quality can compatibly benefit from one smaller LM.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.5	Hongyi Yuan, Keming Lu, Fei Huang, Zheng Yuan, Chang Zhou
Resisting the Lure of the Skyline: Grounding Practices in Active Learning for Morphological Inflection	Active learning (AL) aims to lower the demand of annotation by selecting informative unannotated samples for the model building. In this paper, we explore the importance of conscious experimental design in the language documentation and description setting, particularly the distribution of the unannotated sample pool. We focus on the task of morphological inflection using a Transformer model. We propose context motivated benchmarks: a baseline and skyline. The baseline describes the frequency weighted distribution encountered in natural speech. We simulate this using Wikipedia texts. The skyline defines the more common approach, uniform sampling from a large, balanced corpus (UniMorph, in our case), which often yields mixed results. We note the unrealistic nature of this unannotated pool. When these factors are considered, our results show a clear benefit to targeted sampling.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.4	Saliha Muradoglu, Michael Ginn, Miikka Silfverberg, Mans Hulden

Our experiments showcase the effectiveness of AST editing distance in capturing intricate code structures, revealing a high correlation with established metrics. Furthermore, we explore the strengths and weaknesses of AST editing distance and prompt-based GPT similarity scores in comparison to BLEU score, execution match, and Jaccard Similarity. We propose, optimize, and publish an adaptable metric that demonstrates effectiveness across all tested languages, representing an enhanced version of Tree Similarity of Edit Distance (TSED).	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.3	Yewei Song, Cedric Lothritz, Xunzhu Tang, Tegawendé Bissyandé, Jacques Klein

To evaluate complex reasoning in LLMs more fully, we present FanOutQA, a high-quality dataset of fan-out question-answer pairs and human-annotated decompositions with English Wikipedia as the knowledge base. We formulate three benchmark settings across our dataset and benchmark 7 LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 2, Claude-2.1, and Mixtral-8x7B, finding that contemporary models still have room to improve reasoning over inter-document dependencies in a long context.

Can Language Models Serve as Text-Based World Simulators?	Virtual environments play a key role in benchmarking advances in complex planning and decision-making tasks but are expensive and complicated to build by hand. Can current language models themselves serve as world simulators, correctly predicting how actions change different world states, thus bypassing the need for extensive manual coding? Our goal is to answer this question in the context of text-based simulators. Our approach is to build and use a new benchmark, called ByteSized32-State-Prediction, containing a dataset of text game state transitions and accompanying game tasks. We use this to directly quantify, for the first time, how well LLMs can serve as text-based world simulators. We test GPT-4 on this dataset and find that, despite its impressive performance, it is still an unreliable world simulator without further innovations. This work thus contributes both new insights into current LLM's capabilities and weaknesses, as well as a novel benchmark to track future progress as new models appear.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.1	Ruoyao Wang, Graham Todd, Ziang Xiao, Xingdi Yuan, Marc-Alexandre Côté, Peter Clark, Peter Jansen

ELLA: Empowering LLMs for Interpretable, Accurate and Informative Legal Advice	"Despite remarkable performance in legal consultation exhibited by legal Large Language Models(LLMs) combined with legal article retrieval components, there are still cases when the advice given is incorrect or baseless. To alleviate these problems, we propose ELLA, a tool for Empowering LLMs for interpretable, accurate, and informative Legal Advice. ELLA visually presents the correlation between legal articles and LLM's response by calculating their similarities, providing users with an intuitive legal basis for the responses. Besides, based on the users' queries, ELLA retrieves relevant legal articles and displays them to users. Users can interactively select legal articles for LLM to generate more accurate responses. ELLA also retrieves relevant legal cases for user reference. Our user study shows that presenting the legal basis for the response helps users understand better.

CogMG: Collaborative Augmentation Between Large Language Model and Knowledge Graph	Large language models have become integral to question-answering applications despite their propensity for generating hallucinations and factually inaccurate content. Querying knowledge graphs to reduce hallucinations in LLM meets the challenge of incomplete knowledge coverage in knowledge graphs. On the other hand, updating knowledge graphs by information extraction and knowledge graph completion faces the knowledge update misalignment issue. In this work, we introduce a collaborative augmentation framework, CogMG, leveraging knowledge graphs to address the limitations of LLMs in QA scenarios, explicitly targeting the problems of incomplete knowledge coverage and knowledge update misalignment. The LLMs identify and decompose required knowledge triples that are not present in the KG, enriching them and aligning updates with real-world demands.

Variationist: Exploring Multifaceted Variation and Bias in Written Language Data	Exploring and understanding language data is a fundamental stage in all areas dealing with human language. It allows NLP practitioners to uncover quality concerns and harmful biases in data before training, and helps linguists and social scientists to gain insight into language use and human behavior. Yet, there is currently a lack of a unified, customizable tool to seamlessly inspect and visualize language variation and bias across multiple variables, language units, and diverse metrics that go beyond descriptive statistics. In this paper, we introduce Variationist, a highly-modular, extensible, and task-agnostic tool that fills this gap. Variationist handles at once a potentially unlimited combination of variable types and semantics across diversity and association metrics with regards to the language unit of choice, and orchestrates the creation of up to five-dimensional interactive charts for over 30 variable type-semantics combinations. Through our case studies on computational dialectology, human label variation, and text generation, we show how Variationist enables researchers from different disciplines to effortlessly answer specific research questions or unveil undesired associations in language data. A Python library, code, documentation, and tutorials are made publicly available to the research community.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.33	Alan Ramponi, Camilla Casula, Stefano Menini
LEGENT: Open Platform for Embodied Agents	Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), their integration into language-grounded, human-like embodied agents remains incomplete, hindering complex real-life task performance in 3D environments. Existing integrations often feature limited open-sourcing, challenging collective progress in this field. We introduce LEGENT, an open, scalable platform for developing embodied agents using LLMs and LMMs. LEGENT offers a dual approach: a rich 3D environment with interactive, communicable, and actionable agents, paired with a user-friendly interface, and a sophisticated data generation pipeline utilizing advanced algorithms to exploit supervision from simulated worlds at scale. In our experiments, an embryonic vision-language-action model trained on LEGENT-generated data surpasses GPT-4V in embodied tasks, showcasing promising generalization capabilities.

ITAKE: Interactive Unstructured Text Annotation and Knowledge Extraction System with LLMs and ModelOps	Extracting structured knowledge from unstructured text data has a wide range of application prospects, and a pervasive trend is to develop text annotation tools to help extraction. However, they often encounter issues such as single scenario usage, lack of effective human-machine collaboration, insufficient model supervision, and suboptimal utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduces an interactive unstructured text annotation and knowledge extraction system that synergistically integrates LLMs and ModelOps to alleviate these issues. The system leverages LLMs for enhanced performance in low-resource contexts, employs a ModelOps platform to monitor models throughout their lifecycle, and amalgamates interactive annotation methods with online machine learning and active learning. The demo video and website are now publicly available.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.31	Jiahe Song, Hongxin Ding, Zhiyuan Wang, Yongxin Xu, Yasha Wang, Junfeng Zhao
CharPoet: A Chinese Classical Poetry Generation System Based on Token-free LLM	Automatic Chinese classical poetry generation has attracted much research interest, but achieving effective control over format and content simultaneously remains challenging. Traditional systems usually accept keywords as user inputs, resulting in limited control over content. Large language models (LLMs) improve content control by allowing unrestricted user instructions, but the token-by-token generation process frequently makes format errors. Motivated by this, we propose CharPoet, a Chinese classical poetry generation system based on token-free LLM, which provides effective control over both format and content. Our token-free architecture generates in a character-by-character manner, enabling precise control over the number of characters. Pruned from existing token-based LLMs, CharPoet inherits their pretrained capabilities and can generate poetry following instructions like �Write me a poem for my mother's birthday.� CharPoet achieves format accuracy above 0.96, outperforming Jiuge-GPT-2 (0.91) and GPT-4 (0.38). In terms of content quality, CharPoet surpasses traditional systems including Jiuge, and is comparable to other LLMs. Our system is open source and available at https://modelscope.cn/models/CharPoet/CharPoet. A video demonstration of CharPoet is available at https://youtu.be/voZ25qEp3Dc.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.30	Chengyue Yu, Lei Zang, Jiaotuan Wang, Chenyi Zhuang, Jinjie Gu
Fundus: A Simple-to-Use News Scraper Optimized for High Quality Extractions	This paper introduces Fundus, a user-friendly news scraper that enables users to obtain millions of high-quality news articles with just a few lines of code. Unlike existing news scrapers, we use manually crafted, bespoke content extractors that are specifically tailored to the formatting guidelines of each supported online newspaper. This allows us to optimize our scraping for quality such that retrieved news articles are textually complete and without HTML artifacts. Further, our framework combines both crawling (retrieving HTML from the web or large web archives) and content extraction into a single pipeline. By providing a unified interface for a predefined collection of newspapers, we aim to make Fundus broadly usable even for non-technical users. This paper gives an overview of the framework, discusses our design choices, and presents a comparative evaluation against other popular news scrapers. Our evaluation shows that Fundus yields significantly higher quality extractions (complete and artifact-free news articles) than prior work.The framework is available on GitHub under https://github.com/flairNLP/fundus and can be simply installed using pip.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.29	Max Dallabetta, Conrad Dobberstein, Adrian Breiding, Alan Akbik
SeaLLMs - Large Language Models for Southeast Asia	Despite the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) in various tasks, there remains a linguistic bias that favors high-resource languages, such as English, often at the expense of low-resource and regional languages. To address this imbalance, we introduce SeaLLMs, an innovative series of language models that specifically focuses on Southeast Asian (SEA) languages. SeaLLMs are built upon popular English-centric models through continued pre-training with an extended vocabulary, specialized instruction and alignment tuning to better capture the intricacies of regional languages. This allows them to respect and reflect local cultural norms, customs, stylistic preferences, and legal considerations. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SeaLLM models exhibit superior performance across a wide spectrum of linguistic tasks and assistant-style instruction-following capabilities relative to comparable open-source models. Moreover, they outperform ChatGPT-3.5 in non-Latin languages, such as Thai, Khmer, Lao, and Burmese, by large margins while remaining lightweight and cost-effective to operate.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.28	Xuan-Phi Nguyen, Wenxuan Zhang, Xin Li, Mahani Aljunied, Zhiqiang Hu, Chenhui Shen, Yew Ken Chia, Xingxuan Li, Jianyu Wang, Qingyu Tan, Liying Cheng, Guanzheng Chen, Yue Deng, Sen Yang, Chaoqun Liu, Hang Zhang, Lidong Bing
Proofread: Fixes All Errors with One Tap	The impressive capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful approach to reimagine users' typing experience. This paper demonstrates the Proofread feature in Gboard, a virtual keyboard running on mobile phones. Proofread enables seamless sentence-level and paragraph-level corrections with a single tap. We describe the complete system in this paper, from data generation, metrics design to model tuning and deployment. To obtain models with sufficient quality, we implement a careful data synthetic pipeline tailored to online use cases, design multifaceted metrics, employ a two-stage tuning approach to acquire the dedicated LLM for the feature: the Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) for foundational quality, followed by the Reinforcement Learning (RL) tuning approach for targeted refinement. Specifically, we find sequential tuning on Rewrite and proofread tasks yields the best quality in SFT stage, and propose global and direct rewards in the RL tuning stage to seek further improvement. Extensive experiments on a human-labeled golden set showed our tuned PaLM2-XS model achieved 85.56% good ratio. We launched the feature to Pixel 8 devices by serving the model on TPU v5 in Google Cloud, with thousands of daily active users. Serving latency was significantly reduced by quantization, bucket inference, text segmentation, and speculative decoding.

VeraCT Scan: Retrieval-Augmented Fake News Detection with Justifiable Reasoning	The proliferation of fake news poses a significant threat not only by disseminating misleading information but also by undermining the very foundations of democracy. The recent advance of generative artificial intelligence has further exacerbated the challenge of distinguishing genuine news from fabricated stories. In response to this challenge, we introduce VeraCT Scan, a novel retrieval-augmented system for fake news detection. This system operates by extracting the core facts from a given piece of news and subsequently conducting an internet-wide search to identify corroborating or conflicting reports. Then sources' credibility is leveraged for information verification. Besides determining the veracity of news, we also provide transparent evidence and reasoning to support its conclusions, resulting in the interpretability and trust in the results. In addition to GPT-4 Turbo, Llama-2 13B is also fine-tuned for news content understanding, information verification, and reasoning. Both implementations have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy in the realm of fake news detection.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.25	Cheng Niu, Yang Guan, Yuanhao Wu, Juno Zhu, Juntong Song, Randy Zhong, Kaihua Zhu, Siliang Xu, Shizhe Diao, Tong Zhang
PyFoma: a Python finite-state compiler module	We describe PyFoma, an open-source Python module for constructing weighted and unweighted finite-state transducers and automata from regular expressions, string rewriting rules, right-linear grammars, or low-level state/transition manipulation. A large variety of standard algorithms for working with finite-state machines is included, with a particular focus on the needs of linguistic and NLP applications. The data structures and code in the module are designed for legibility to allow for potential use in teaching the theory and algorithms associated with finite-state machines.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.24	Mans Hulden, Michael Ginn, Miikka Silfverberg, Michael Hammond
UltraEval: A Lightweight Platform for Flexible and Comprehensive Evaluation for LLMs	Evaluation is pivotal for honing Large Language Models (LLMs), pinpointing their capabilities and guiding enhancements. The rapid development of LLMs calls for a lightweight and easy-to-use framework for swift evaluation deployment. However, due to the various implementation details to consider, developing a comprehensive evaluation platform is never easy. Existing platforms are often complex and poorly modularized, hindering seamless incorporation into researcher's workflows. This paper introduces UltraEval, a user-friendly evaluation framework characterized by lightweight, comprehensiveness, modularity, and efficiency. We identify and reimplement three core components of model evaluation (models, data, and metrics). The resulting composability allows for the free combination of different models, tasks, prompts, and metrics within a unified evaluation workflow. Additionally, UltraEval supports diverse models owing to a unified HTTP service and provides sufficient inference acceleration.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.23	Chaoqun He, Renjie Luo, Shengding Hu, Ranchi Zhao, Jie Zhou, Hanghao Wu, Jiajie Zhang, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun
DocPilot: Copilot for Automating PDF Edit Workflows in Documents	Digital documents, such as PDFs, are vital in business workflows, enabling communication, documentation, and collaboration. Handling PDFs can involve navigating complex workflows and numerous tools (e.g., comprehension, annotation, editing), which can be tedious and time-consuming for users. We introduce DocPilot, an AI-assisted document workflow Copilot system capable of understanding user intent and executing tasks accordingly to help users streamline their workflows. DocPilot undertakes intelligent orchestration of various tools through LLM prompting in four steps: (1) Task plan generation, (2) Task plan verification and self-correction, (3) Multi-turn User Feedback, and (4) Task Plan Execution via Code Generation and Error log-based Code Self-Revision. The primary goal of this system is to free the user from the intricacies of document editing, enabling them to focus on the creative aspects and enrich their document management experience.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.22	Puneet Mathur, Alexa Siu, Varun Manjunatha, Tong Sun
LinkTransformer: A Unified Package for Record Linkage with Transformer Language Models	Many computational analyses require linking information across noisy text datasets. While large language models (LLMs) offer significant promise, approximate string matching packages in popular statistical softwares such as R and Stata remain predominant in academic applications. These packages have simple interfaces and can be easily extended to a diversity of languages and settings, and for academic applications, ease-of-use and extensibility are essential. In contrast, packages for record linkage with LLMs require significant familiarity with deep learning frameworks and often focus on specialized applications of commercial value in English. The open-source package LinkTransformer aims to bridge this gap by providing an end-to-end software for performing record linkage and other data cleaning tasks with transformer LLMs, treating linkage as a text retrieval problem. At its core is an off-the-shelf toolkit for applying transformer models to record linkage. LinkTransformer contains a rich repository of pre-trained models for multiple languages and supports easy integration of any transformer language model from Hugging Face or OpenAI, providing the extensibility required for many scholarly applications. Its APIs also perform common data processing tasks, e.g., aggregation, noisy de-duplication, and translation-free cross-lingual linkage. LinkTransformer contains comprehensive tools for efficient model tuning, allowing for highly customized applications, and users can easily contribute their custom-trained models to its model hub to ensure reproducibility. Using a novel benchmark dataset geared towards academic applications, we show that LinkTransformer - with both custom models and Hugging Face or OpenAI models off-the-shelf - outperforms string matching by a wide margin. By combining transformer LMs with intuitive APIs, LinkTransformer aims to democratize these performance gains for those who lack familiarity with deep learning frameworks.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.21	Abhishek Arora, Melissa Dell
AutoRE: Document-Level Relation Extraction with Large Language Models	Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities in comprehending and generating text, motivating numerous researchers to utilize them for Information Extraction (IE) purposes, including Relation Extraction (RE). Nonetheless, most existing methods are predominantly designed for Sentence-level Relation Extraction (SentRE) tasks, which typically encompass a restricted set of relations and triplet facts within a single sentence. Furthermore, certain approaches resort to treating relations as candidate choices integrated into prompt templates, leading to inefficient processing and suboptimal performance when tackling Document-Level Relation Extraction (DocRE) tasks, which entail handling multiple relations and triplet facts distributed across a given document, posing distinct challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AutoRE, an end-to-end DocRE model that adopts a novel RE extraction paradigm named RHF (Relation-Head-Facts). Unlike existing approaches, AutoRE does not rely on the assumption of known relation options, making it more reflective of real-world scenarios. Additionally, we have developed an easily extensible RE framework using a Parameters Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) algorithm (QLoRA). Our experiments on the RE-DocRED dataset showcase AutoRE's best performance, achieving state-of-the-art results, surpassing TAG by 10.03% and 9.03% respectively on the dev and test set. The code is available and the demonstration video is provided.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.20	Lilong Xue, Dan Zhang, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang
OpenEval: Benchmarking Chinese LLMs across Capability, Alignment and Safety	The rapid development of Chinese large language models (LLMs) poses big challenges for efficient LLM evaluation. While current initiatives have introduced new benchmarks or evaluation platforms for assessing Chinese LLMs, many of these focus primarily on capabilities, usually overlooking potential alignment and safety issues. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEval, an evaluation testbed that benchmarks Chinese LLMs across capability, alignment and safety. For capability assessment, we include 12 benchmark datasets to evaluate Chinese LLMs from 4 sub-dimensions: NLP tasks, disciplinary knowledge, commonsense reasoning and mathematical reasoning. For alignment assessment, OpenEval contains 7 datasets that examines the bias, offensiveness and illegalness in the outputs yielded by Chinese LLMs. To evaluate safety, especially anticipated risks (e.g., power-seeking, self-awareness) of advanced LLMs, we include 6 datasets. In addition to these benchmarks, we have implemented a phased public evaluation and benchmark update strategy to ensure that OpenEval is in line with the development of Chinese LLMs or even able to provide cutting-edge benchmark datasets to guide the development of Chinese LLMs. In our first public evaluation, we have tested a range of Chinese LLMs, spanning from 7B to 72B parameters, including both open-source and proprietary models. Evaluation results indicate that while Chinese LLMs have shown impressive performance in certain tasks, more attention should be directed towards broader aspects such as commonsense reasoning, alignment, and safety.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.19	Chuang Liu, Linhao Yu, Jiaxuan Li, Renren Jin, Yufei Huang, Ling Shi, Junhui Zhang, Xinmeng Ji, Tingting Cui, Liutao Liutao, Jinwang Song, Hongying Zan, Sun Li, Deyi Xiong

IMGTB: A Framework for Machine-Generated Text Detection Benchmarking	In the era of large language models generating high quality texts, it is a necessity to develop methods for detection of machine-generated text to avoid their harmful use or simply for annotation purposes. It is, however, also important to properly evaluate and compare such developed methods. Recently, a few benchmarks have been proposed for this purpose; however, integration of newest detection methods is rather challenging, since new methods appear each month and provide slightly different evaluation pipelines.In this paper, we present the IMGTB framework, which simplifies the benchmarking of machine-generated text detection methods by easy integration of custom (new) methods and evaluation datasets. In comparison to existing frameworks, it enables to objectively compare statistical metric-based zero-shot detectors with classification-based detectors and with differently fine-tuned detectors. Its configurability and flexibility makes research and development of new detection methods easier, especially their comparison to the existing state-of-the-art detectors. The default set of analyses, metrics and visualizations offered by the tool follows the established practices of machine-generated text detection benchmarking found in state-of-the-art literature.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.17	Michal Spiegel, Dominik Macko
LinguaLinked: Distributed Large Language Model Inference on Mobile Devices	Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) locally on mobile devices presents a significant challenge due to their extensive memory requirements. In this paper, we introduce LinguaLinked, a system for decentralized, distributed LLM inference on mobile devices. LinguaLinked enables collaborative execution of the inference task across multiple trusted devices and ensures data privacy by processing information locally. LinguaLinked uses three key strategies. First, an optimized model assignment technique segments LLMs and uses linear optimization to align segments with each device�s capabilities. Second, an optimized data transmission mechanism ensures efficient and structured data flow between model segments while also maintaining the integrity of the original model structure. Finally, LinguaLinked incorporates a runtime load balancer that actively monitors and redistributes tasks among mobile devices to prevent bottlenecks, enhancing the system�s overall efficiency and responsiveness. We demonstrate that LinguaLinked facilitates efficient LLM inference while maintaining consistent throughput and minimal latency through extensive testing across various mobile devices, from high-end to low-end Android devices.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.16	Junchen Zhao, Yurun Song, Simenl3@uci.edu Simenl3@uci.edu, Ian Harris, Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi
JORA: JAX Tensor-Parallel LoRA Library for Retrieval Augmented Fine-Tuning	The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) for retrieval-based tasks, particularly in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), faces significant memory constraints, especially when fine-tuning extensive prompt sequences. Current open-source libraries support full-model inference and fine-tuning across multiple GPUs but fall short of accommodating the efficient parameter distribution required for retrieved context. Addressing this gap, we introduce a novel framework for PEFT-compatible fine-tuning of GPT models, leveraging distributed training. Our framework uniquely utilizes JAX's just-in-time (JIT) compilation and tensor-sharding for efficient resource management, thereby enabling accelerated fine-tuning with reduced memory requirements. This advancement significantly improves the scalability and feasibility of fine-tuning LLMs for complex RAG applications, even on systems with limited GPU resources. Our experiments show more than 12x improvement in runtime compared to Hugging Face/DeepSpeed implementation with four GPUs while consuming less than half the VRAM per GPU.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.15	Anique Tahir, Lu Cheng, Huan Liu

We propose LocalRQA, an open-source toolkit that features a wide selection of model training algorithms, evaluation methods, and deployment tools curated from the latest research. As a showcase, we build QA systems using online documentation obtained from Databricks and Faire's websites. We find 7B-models trained and deployed using LocalRQA reach a similar performance compared to using OpenAI's text-ada-002 and GPT-4-turbo.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.14	Xiao Yu, Yunan Lu, Zhou Yu
NLP-KG: A System for Exploratory Search of Scientific Literature in Natural Language Processing	Scientific literature searches are often exploratory, whereby users are not yet familiar with a particular field or concept but are interested in learning more about it. However, existing systems for scientific literature search are typically tailored to keyword-based lookup searches, limiting the possibilities for exploration. We propose NLP-KG, a feature-rich system designed to support the exploration of research literature in unfamiliar natural language processing (NLP) fields. In addition to a semantic search, NLP-KG allows users to easily find survey papers that provide a quick introduction to a field of interest. Further, a Fields of Study hierarchy graph enables users to familiarize themselves with a field and its related areas. Finally, a chat interface allows users to ask questions about unfamiliar concepts or specific articles in NLP and obtain answers grounded in knowledge retrieved from scientific publications. Our system provides users with comprehensive exploration possibilities, supporting them in investigating the relationships between different fields, understanding unfamiliar concepts in NLP, and finding relevant research literature.

BotEval: Facilitating Interactive Human Evaluation	Following the rapid progress in natural language processing (NLP) models, language models are applied to increasingly more complex interactive tasks such as negotiations and conversation moderations. Having human evaluators directly interact with these NLP models is essential for adequately evaluating the performance on such interactive tasks. We develop BotEval, an easily customizable, open-source, evaluation toolkit that focuses on enabling human-bot interactions as part of the evaluation process, as opposed to human evaluators making judgements for a static input. BotEval balances flexibility for customization and user-friendliness by providing templates for common use cases that span various degrees of complexity and built-in compatibility with popular crowdsourcing platforms.We showcase the numerous useful features of BotEval through a study that evaluates the performance of various chatbots on their effectiveness for conversational moderation and discuss how BotEval differs from other annotation tools.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.11	Hyundong Cho, Thamme Gowda, Yuyang Huang, Zixun Lu, Tianli Tong, Jonathan May
EasyInstruct: An Easy-to-use Instruction Processing Framework for Large Language Models	In recent years, instruction tuning has gained increasing attention and emerged as a crucial technique to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). To construct high-quality instruction datasets, many instruction processing approaches have been proposed, aiming to achieve a delicate balance between data quantity and data quality. Nevertheless, due to inconsistencies that persist among various instruction processing methods, there is no standard open-source instruction processing implementation framework available for the community, which hinders practitioners from further developing and advancing. To facilitate instruction processing research and development, we present EasyInstruct, an easy-to-use instruction processing framework for LLMs, which modularizes instruction generation, selection, and prompting, while also considering their combination and interaction. EasyInstruct is publicly released and actively maintained at Github, along with an online demo app and a demo video for quick-start, calling for broader research centered on instruction data and synthetic data.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.10	Yixin Ou, Ningyu Zhang, Honghao Gui, Ziwen Xu, Shuofei Qiao, Runnan Fang, Lei Li, Zhen Bi, Guozhou Zheng, Huajun Chen
EasyEdit: An Easy-to-use Knowledge Editing Framework for Large Language Models	Large Language Models (LLMs) usually suffer from knowledge cutoff or fallacy issues, which means they are unaware of unseen events or generate text with incorrect facts owing to outdated/noisy data. To this end, many knowledge editing approaches for LLMs have emerged – aiming to subtly inject/edit updated knowledge or adjust undesired behavior while minimizing the impact on unrelated inputs. Nevertheless, due to significant differences among various knowledge editing methods and the variations in task setups, there is no standard implementation framework available for the community, which hinders practitioners from applying knowledge editing to applications. To address these issues, we propose EasyEdit, an easy-to-use knowledge editing framework for LLMs. It supports various cutting-edge knowledge editing approaches and can be readily applied to many well-known LLMs such as T5, GPT-J, LlaMA, etc. Empirically, we report the knowledge editing results on LlaMA-2 with EasyEdit, demonstrating that knowledge editing surpasses traditional fine-tuning in terms of reliability and generalization. We have released the source code on GitHub, along with Google Colab tutorials and comprehensive documentation for beginners to get started.

LM Transparency Tool: Interactive Tool for Analyzing Transformer Language Models	We present the LM Transparency Tool (LM-TT), an open-source interactive toolkit for analyzing the internal workings of Transformer-based language models. Differently from previously existing tools that focus on isolated parts of the decision-making process, our framework is designed to make the entire prediction process transparent, and allows tracing back model behavior from the top-layer representation to very fine-grained parts of the model. Specifically, it (i) shows the important part of the whole input-to-output information flow, (ii) allows attributing any changes done by a model block to individual attention heads and feed-forward neurons, (iii) allows interpreting the functions of those heads or neurons. A crucial part of this pipeline is showing the importance of specific model components at each step. As a result, we are able to look at the roles of model components only in cases where they are important for a prediction. Since knowing which components should be inspected is key for analyzing large models where the number of these components is extremely high, we believe our tool will greatly support the interpretability community both in research settings and in practical applications.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.6	Igor Tufanov, Karen Hambardzumyan, Javier Ferrando, Elena Voita
Wordflow: Social Prompt Engineering for Large Language Models	Large language models (LLMs) require well-crafted prompts for effective use. Prompt engineering, the process of designing prompts, is challenging, particularly for non-experts who are less familiar with AI technologies. While researchers have proposed techniques and tools to assist LLM users in prompt design, these works primarily target AI application developers rather than non-experts. To address this research gap, we propose social prompt engineering, a novel paradigm that leverages social computing techniques to facilitate collaborative prompt design. To investigate social prompt engineering, we introduce Wordflow, an open-source and social text editor that enables everyday users to easily create, run, share, and discover LLM prompts. Additionally, by leveraging modern web technologies, Wordflow allows users to run LLMs locally and privately in their browsers. Two usage scenarios highlight how social prompt engineering and our tool can enhance laypeople's interaction with LLMs. Wordflow is publicly accessible at https://poloclub.github.io/wordflow.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.5	Zijie Wang, Aishwarya Chakravarthy, David Munechika, Duen Horng Chau
Towards the TopMost: A Topic Modeling System Toolkit	Topic models have a rich history with various applications and have recently been reinvigorated by neural topic modeling. However, these numerous topic models adopt totally distinct datasets, implementations, and evaluations. This impedes quick utilization and fair comparisons, and thereby hinders their research progress and applications. To tackle this challenge, we in this paper propose a Topic Modeling System Toolkit (TopMost). Compared to existing toolkits, TopMost stands out by supporting more extensive features. It covers a broader spectrum of topic modeling scenarios with their complete lifecycles, including datasets, preprocessing, models, training, and evaluations. Thanks to its highly cohesive and decoupled modular design, TopMost enables rapid utilization, fair comparisons, and flexible extensions of diverse cutting-edge topic models. Our code, tutorials, and documentation are available at https://github.com/bobxwu/topmost.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.4	Xiaobao Wu, Fengjun Pan, Anh Tuan Luu
XNLP: An Interactive Demonstration System for Universal Structured NLP	Structured Natural Language Processing (XNLP) is an important subset of NLP that entails understanding the underlying semantic or syntactic structure of texts, which serves as a foundational component for many downstream applications. Despite certain recent efforts to explore universal solutions for specific categories of XNLP tasks, a comprehensive and effective approach for unifying all XNLP tasks long remains underdeveloped. Meanwhile, while XNLP demonstration systems are vital for researchers exploring various XNLP tasks, existing platforms can be limited to, e.g., supporting few XNLP tasks, lacking interactivity and universalness. To this end, we propose an advanced XNLP demonstration system, where we leverage LLM to achieve universal XNLP, with one model for all with high generalizability. Overall, our system advances in multiple aspects, including universal XNLP modeling, high performance, interpretability, scalability, and interactivity, offering a unified platform for exploring diverse XNLP tasks in the community.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.3	Hao Fei, Meishan Zhang, Min Zhang, Tat-Seng Chua
OpenVNA: A Framework for Analyzing the Behavior of Multimodal Language Understanding System under Noisy Scenarios	"We present OpenVNA, an open-source framework designed for analyzing the behavior of multimodal language understanding systems under noisy conditions. OpenVNA serves as an intuitive toolkit tailored for researchers, facilitating convenience batch-level robustness evaluation and on-the-fly instance-level demonstration. It primarily features a benchmark Python library for assessing global model robustness, offering high flexibility and extensibility, thereby enabling customization with user-defined noise types and models.

PAI-Diffusion: Constructing and Serving a Family of Open Chinese Diffusion Models for Text-to-image Synthesis on the Cloud	Text-to-image synthesis for the Chinese language poses unique challenges due to its large vocabulary size, and intricate character relationships. While existing diffusion models have shown promise in generating images from textual descriptions, they often neglect domain-specific contexts and lack robustness in handling the Chinese language. This paper introduces PAI-Diffusion, a comprehensive framework that addresses these limitations. PAI-Diffusion incorporates both general and domain-specific Chinese diffusion models, enabling the generation of contextually relevant images. It explores the potential of using LoRA and ControlNet for fine-grained image style transfer and image editing, empowering users with enhanced control over image generation. Moreover, PAI-Diffusion seamlessly integrates with Alibaba Cloud's Platform for AI, providing accessible and scalable solutions. All the Chinese diffusion model checkpoints, LoRAs, and ControlNets, including domain-specific ones, are publicly available. A user-friendly Chinese WebUI and the diffusers-api elastic inference toolkit, also open-sourced, further facilitate the easy deployment of PAI-Diffusion models in various local and cloud environments, making it a valuable resource for Chinese text-to-image synthesis.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-demos.1	Chengyu Wang, Zhongjie Duan, Bingyan Liu, Xinyi Zou, Cen Chen, Kui Jia, Jun Huang
In-Context Symbolic Regression: Leveraging Large Language Models for Function Discovery	State of the art Symbolic Regression (SR) methods currently build specialized models, while the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce the first comprehensive framework that utilizes LLMs for the task of SR.We propose In-Context Symbolic Regression (ICSR), an SR method which iteratively refines a functional form with an LLM and determines its coefficients with an external optimizer. ICSR leverages LLMs' strong mathematical prior both to propose an initial set of possible functions given the observations and to refine them based on their errors.Our findings reveal that LLMs are able to successfully find symbolic equations that fit the given data, matching or outperforming the overall performance of the best SR baselines on four popular benchmarks, while yielding simpler equations with better out of distribution generalization.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.49	Matteo Merler, Katsiaryna Haitsiukevich, Nicola Dainese, Pekka Marttinen
CheckersGPT: Learning World Models through Language Modeling	Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have been trained using just the next token prediction objective, these have shown impressive performance on various tasks. Consequently, it has attracted research interests in this regard. While one line of work in the past has suggested that LLMs learn surface-level statistics from the dataset, another line of work emphasizes that the learned representations are effective for simulating the underlying world model, considering the causal relationship for the next token prediction. This phenomenon is often referred to as the emergence of a world model in sequence prediction tasks. Recent work has demonstrated this phenomenon in a simulated setting of board games like Othello and Chess. In this paper, we analyze the game of Checkers to find out the emergence of a world model in a language model. By training a GPT-style autoregressive language model using only the next character prediction objective, we find that the model does show a hint of learning a world model representation of the board positions. We perform our analysis on two datasets: 1) synthetic dataset, which comes from the checkers game tree, and 2) human gameplay dataset. With multiple models trained with different layer sizes, we find that increasing the parameter size does help learn better world model representation decoded by linear probes.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.48	Abhinav Joshi, Vaibhav Sharma, Ashutosh Modi
How Well Do Vision Models Encode Diagram Attributes?	Research on understanding and generating diagrams has used vision models such as CLIP. However, it remains unclear whether these models accurately identify diagram attributes, such as node colors and shapes, along with edge colors and connection patterns. This study evaluates how well vision models recognize the diagram attributes by probing the model and retrieving diagrams using text queries. Experimental results showed that while vision models can recognize differences in node colors, shapes, and edge colors, they struggle to identify differences in edge connection patterns that play a pivotal role in the semantics of diagrams. Moreover, we revealed inadequate alignment between diagram attributes and language representations in the embedding space.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.47	Haruto Yoshida, Keito Kudo, Yoichi Aoki, Ryota Tanaka, Itsumi Saito, Keisuke Sakaguchi, Kentaro Inui
An Individualized News Affective Response Dataset	The rise of sensationalism in news reporting, driven by market saturation and online competition, has compromised news quality and trust. At the core of sensationalism is the evocation of affective responses in the readers. Current NLP approaches to emotion detection often overlook the subjective differences in groups and individuals, relying on aggregation techniques that can obscure nuanced reactions. We introduce a novel large-scale dataset capturing subjective affective responses to news headlines. The dataset includes Facebook post screenshots from popular UK media outlets and uses a comprehensive annotation scheme. Annotators report their affective responses, provide discrete emotion labels, assess relevance to current events, and indicate sharing likelihood. Additionally, we collect demographic, personality, and media consumption data. This ongoing dataset aims to enable more accurate models of affective response by considering individual and contextual factors. This work is ongoing and we highly appreciate any feedback.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.46	Tiancheng Hu, Nigel Collier
Question-Analysis Prompting Improves LLM Performance in Reasoning Tasks	Although LLMs have the potential to transform many fields, they still underperform humans in reasoning tasks. Existing methods induce the model to produce step-by-step calculations, but this research explores the question: Does making the LLM analyze the question improve its performance? We propose a novel prompting strategy called Question Analysis Prompting (QAP), in which the model is prompted to explain the question in 'n' words before solving. The value of 'n' influences the length of response generated by the model. QAP is evaluated on GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 Turbo on arithmetic datasets GSM8K, AQuA, and SAT and commonsense dataset StrategyQA. QAP is compared with other state-of-the-art prompts including chain-of-thought (CoT), Plan and Solve Prompting (PS+) and Take A Deep Breath (TADB). QAP outperforms all state-of-the-art prompts on AQuA and SAT datasets on both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. QAP consistently ranks among the top-2 prompts on 75% of the tests. A key factor of QAP performance can be attributed to response length, where detailed responses are beneficial when answering harder questions, but can negatively affect easy questions.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.45	Dharunish Yugeswardeenoo, Kevin Zhu, Sean O’Brien
Curriculum Learning for Small Code Language Models	Code language models have emerged as useful tools for various programming tasks, yet they often struggle when it comes to complex ones. In this paper, we explore the potential of curriculum learning in enhancing the performance of these models. While prior research has suggested that curriculum learning does not necessarily help in improving the performance of language models, our results surprisingly show that this may not be the case for code language models. We demonstrate that a well-designed curriculum learning approach significantly improves the accuracy of small decoder-only code language models on the task of code execution, while its effect on code completion is less significant. To explore the potential of curriculum learning, we train multiple GPT models with 1 million parameters each to predict the next token and evaluate them on code completion and execution tasks. Our contributions include proposing a novel code difficulty assessment metric by combining software code measures, investigating the effectiveness of Curriculum Learning for code language models, and introducing a Novel Curriculum Learning schedule that enhances the performance of small decoder-only language models in code execution tasks. The results of this paper open the door for more research on the use of curriculum learning for code language models.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.44	Marwa Na�r, Kamel Yamani, Lynda Lhadj, Riyadh Baghdadi
Improving Sentence Embeddings with Automatic Generation of Training Data Using Few-shot Examples	Decoder-based large language models (LLMs) have shown high performance on many tasks in natural language processing. This is also true for sentence embedding learning, where a decoder-based model, PromptEOL, has achieved the best performance on semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. However, PromptEOL requires a manually annotated natural language inference (NLI) dataset for fine-tuning.We aim to improve sentence embeddings without using large manually annotated datasets by automatically generating an NLI dataset with an LLM and using it for fine-tuning of PromptEOL. To achieve this, we explore methods of data generation suitable for sentence embedding learning in this study. Specifically, we will focus on automatic dataset generation through few-shot learning and explore the appropriate methods to leverage few-shot examples. Experimental results on the STS tasks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing models in settings without large manually annotated datasets.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.43	Soma Sato, Hayato Tsukagoshi, Ryohei Sasano, Koichi Takeda
Beyond Abstracts: A New Dataset, Prompt Design Strategy and Method for Biomedical Synthesis Generation	The biomedical field relies on cost and time intensive systematic reviews of papers to enable practitioners to keep up to date with research. Impressive recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made the task of automating at least part of the systematic review process feasible, but progress is slow. This paper identifies some factors that may have been holding research back, and proposes a new, enhanced dataset and prompting-based method for automatic synthesis generation, the most challenging step for automation. We test different models and types of information from and about biomedical studies for their usefulness in obtaining high-quality results.We find that, surprisingly, inclusion of paper abstracts can worsens results. Instead, study summary information, and system instructions informed by domain knowledge, are key to producing high-quality syntheses.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.42	James O’Doherty, Cian Nolan, Yufang Hou, Anya Belz
An Analysis under a Unified Formulation of Learning Algorithms with Output Constraints	"Neural networks (NN) perform well in diverse tasks, but sometimes produce nonsensical results to humans. Most NN models ""solely"" learn from (input, output) pairs, occasionally conflicting with human knowledge. Many studies indicate injecting human knowledge by reducing output constraints during training can improve model performance and reduce constraint violations.While there have been several attempts to compare different existing algorithms under the same programming framework, nonetheless, there has been no previous work that categorizes learning algorithms with output constraints in a unified manner. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We categorize the previous studies based on three axes: type of constraint loss used (e.g. probabilistic soft logic, REINFORCE), exploration strategy of constraint-violating examples, and integration mechanism of learning signals from main task and constraint.(2) We propose new algorithms to integrate the information of main task and constraint injection, inspired by continual-learning algorithms.(3) Furthermore, we propose the H𝛽 -score as a metric for considering the main task metric and constraint violation simultaneously.To provide a thorough analysis, we examine all the algorithms on three NLP tasks: natural language inference (NLI), synthetic transduction examples (STE), and semantic role labeling (SRL). We explore and reveal the key factors of various algorithms associated with achieving high H𝛽 -scores."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.41	Mooho Song, Jay-Yoon Lee
Seed-Free Synthetic Data Generation Framework for Instruction-Tuning LLMs: A Case Study in Thai	We present a synthetic data approach for instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) for low-resource languages in a data-efficient manner, specifically focusing on Thai. We identify three key properties that contribute to the effectiveness of instruction-tuning datasets: fluency, diversity, and cultural context. We propose a seed-data-free framework for generating synthetic instruction-tuning data that incorporates these essential properties. Our framework employs an LLM to generate diverse topics, retrieve relevant contexts from Wikipedia, and create instructions for various tasks, such as question answering, summarization, and conversation. The experimental results show that our best-performing synthetic dataset, which incorporates all three key properties, achieves competitive performance using only 5,000 instructions when compared to state-of-the-art Thai LLMs trained on hundreds of thousands of instructions. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/parinzee/seed-free-synthetic-instruct.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.38	Parinthapat Pengpun, Can Udomcharoenchaikit, Weerayut Buaphet, Peerat Limkonchotiwat
CoVoSwitch: Machine Translation of Synthetic Code-Switched Text Based on Intonation Units	Multilingual code-switching research is often hindered by the lack and linguistically biased status of available datasets. To expand language representation, we synthesize code-switching data by replacing intonation units detected through PSST, a speech segmentation model fine-tuned from OpenAI's Whisper, using a speech-to-text translation dataset, CoVoST 2. With our dataset, CoVoSwitch, spanning 13 languages, we evaluate the code-switching translation performance of two multilingual translation models, M2M-100 418M and NLLB-200 600M. We reveal that the inclusion of code-switching units results in higher translation performance than monolingual settings and that models are better at code-switching translation into English than non-English. Further, low-resource languages gain most from integration of code-switched units when translating into English but much less when translating into non-English. Translations into low-resource languages also perform worse than even raw code-switched inputs. We find that systems excel at copying English tokens but struggle with non-English tokens, that the off-target problem in monolingual settings is also relevant in code-switching settings, and that models hallucinate in code-switching translation by introducing words absent in both of the original source sentences. CoVoSwitch and code are available at https://github.com/sophiayk20/covoswitch.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.40	Yeeun Kang
Bridging Distribution Gap via Semantic Rewriting with LLMs to Enhance OOD Robustness	"This paper investigates the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) against Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data within the context of sentiment analysis. Traditional fine-tuning approaches often fail to generalize effectively across different data distributions, limiting the practical deployment of LLMs in dynamic real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method called ""Semantic Rewriting,"" which leverages the inherent flexibility of LLMs to align both in-distribution (ID) and OOD data with the LLMs distributions. By semantically transforming sentences to minimize linguistic discrepancies, our approach helps to standardize features across datasets, thus enhancing model robustness. We conduct extensive experiments with several benchmark datasets and LLMs to validate the efficacy of our method. The results demonstrate that Semantic Rewriting significantly improves the performance of models on OOD tasks, outperforming traditional methods in both robustness and generalization capabilities. Our findings suggest that Semantic Rewriting is a promising technique for developing more reliable and versatile NLP systems capable of performing robustly across diverse operational environments."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.39	Manas Madine
Automatic Derivation of Semantic Representations for Thai Serial Verb Constructions: A Grammar-Based Approach	Deep semantic representations are useful for many NLU tasks (Droganova and Zeman 2019; Schuster and Manning-2016). Manual annotation to build these representations is time-consuming, and so automatic approaches are preferred (Droganova and Zeman 2019; Bender et al. 2015). This paper demonstrates how rich semantic representations can be automatically derived for Thai Serial Verb Constructions (SVCs), where the semantic relationship between component verbs is not immediately clear from the surface forms. I present the first fully-implemented HPSG analysis for Thai SVCs, deriving appropriate semantic representations (MRS; Copestake et al. 2005) from syntactic features, implemented within a DELPH-IN computational grammar (Slayden 2009). This analysis increases verified coverage of SVCs by 73% and decreases ambiguity by 46%.

Can LLMs Augment Low-Resource Reading Comprehension Datasets? Opportunities and Challenges	Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance on a wide range of NLP tasks, demonstrating the ability to reason and apply common sense. A relevant application is to use them for creating high-quality synthetic datasets for downstream tasks. In this work, we probe whether GPT-4 can be used to augment existing extractive reading comprehension datasets. Automating data annotation processes has the potential to save large amounts of time, money, and effort that goes into manually labeling datasets. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of GPT-4 as a replacement for human annotators for low-resource reading comprehension tasks, by comparing performance after fine-tuning, and the cost associated with annotation. This work serves to be the first analysis of LLMs as synthetic data augmenters for QA systems, highlighting the unique opportunities and challenges. Additionally, we release augmented versions of low-resource datasets, that will allow the research community to create further benchmarks for evaluation of generated datasets.

Trace-of-Thought Prompting: Investigating Prompt-Based Knowledge Distillation Through Question Decomposition	Knowledge distillation allows smaller neural networks to emulate the performance of larger, teacher models with reduced computational demands. Traditional methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often necessitate extensive fine-tuning, which limits their accessibility. To address this, we introduce Trace-of-Thought Prompting, a novel framework designed to distill critical reasoning capabilities from large-scale teacher models (over 8 billion parameters) to small-scale student models (up to 8 billion parameters). This approach leverages problem decomposition to enhance interpretability and facilitate human-in-the-loop interventions. Empirical evaluations on the GSM8K and MATH datasets show that student models achieve accuracy gains of up to 113% on GSM8K and 20% on MATH, with significant improvements particularly notable in smaller models like Llama 2 and Zephyr. Our results suggest a promising pathway for open-source, small-scale models to eventually serve as both students and teachers, potentially reducing our reliance on large-scale, proprietary models.

Homophone2Vec: Embedding Space Analysis for Empirical Evaluation of Phonological and Semantic Similarity	This paper introduces a novel method for empirically evaluating the relationship between the phonological and semantic similarity of linguistic units using embedding spaces. Chinese character homophones are used as a proof-of-concept. We employ cosine similarity as a proxy for semantic similarity between characters, and compare relationships between phonologically-related characters and baseline characters (chosen as similar-frequency characters). We show there is a strongly statistically significant positive semantic relationship among different Chinese characters at varying levels of sound-sharing. We also perform some basic probing using t-SNE and UMAP visualizations, and indicate directions for future applications of this method.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.34	Sophie Wu, Anita Zheng, Joey Chuang
Basreh or Basra? Geoparsing Historical Locations in the Svoboda Diaries	Geoparsing, the task of assigning coordinates to locations extracted from free text, is invaluable in enabling us to place locations in time and space. In the historical domain, many geoparsing corpora are from large news collections. We examine the Svoboda Diaries, a small historical corpus written primarily in English, with many location names in transliterated Arabic. We develop a pipeline employing named entity recognition for geotagging, and a map-based generate-and-rank approach incorporating candidate name augmentation and clustering of location context words for geocoding. Our system outperforms existing map-based geoparsers in terms of accuracy, lowest mean distance error, and number of locations correctly identified. As location names may vary from those in knowledge bases, we find that augmented candidate generation is instrumental in the system's performance. Among our candidate generation methods, the generation of transliterated names contributed the most to increased location matches in the knowledge base. Our main contribution is proposing an integrated pipeline for geoparsing of historical corpora using augmented candidate location name generation and clustering methods – an approach that can be generalized to other texts with foreign or non-standard spellings.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.33	Jolie Zhou, Camille Cole, Annie Chen
Rescue: Ranking LLM Responses with Partial Ordering to Improve Response Generation	Customizing LLMs for a specific task involves separating high-quality responses from lower-quality ones. This skill can be developed using supervised fine-tuning with extensive human preference data. However, obtaining a large volume of expert-annotated data is costly for most tasks. In this paper, we explore a novel method to optimize LLMs using ranking metrics. This method trains the model to prioritize the best responses from a pool of candidates created for a particular task. Rather than a traditional full ordering, we advocate for a partial ordering, as achieving consensus on the perfect order of candidate responses can be challenging. Our partial ordering is more robust, less sensitive to noise, and can be achieved with limited human annotations or through heuristic methods. We test our system's improved response generation ability using benchmark datasets, including textual entailment and multi-document question answering. We conduct ablation studies to understand crucial factors, such as how to gather candidate responses for a specific task, determine their most suitable order, and balance supervised fine-tuning with ranking metrics. Our approach, named RESCUE, offers a promising avenue for enhancing the response generation and task accuracy of LLMs.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.32	Yikun Wang, Rui Zheng, Haoming Li, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui, Fei Liu

Foundation Model for Biomedical Graphs: Integrating Knowledge Graphs and Protein Structures to Large Language Models	Transformer model has been a de-facto standard in natural language processing. Its adaptations in other fields such as computer vision showed promising results that this architecture is a powerful neural network in representation learning regardless of the data type. This recent success has led to research in multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), which enabled us to new types of tasks and applications with multiple data types. However, multimodal LLM in the biomedical domain is primarily limited to images, text, and/or sequence data. Here I propose to work on multimodal LLM architecture for biomedical graphs such as protein structure and chemical molecules. The research hypothesis is based on the fact that clinicians and researchers in computational biology and clinical research take advantage of various information for their decision-making process. Therefore, an AI model being able to handle multiple data types should boost its ability to use diverse knowledge for improved performances in clinical applications.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.30	Yunsoo Kim
Compromesso! Italian Many-Shot Jailbreaks undermine the safety of Large Language Models	As diverse linguistic communities and users adopt Large Language Models (LLMs), assessing their safety across languages becomes critical. Despite ongoing efforts to align these models with safe and ethical guidelines, they can still be induced into unsafe behavior with jailbreaking, a technique in which models are prompted to act outside their operational guidelines. What research has been conducted on these vulnerabilities was predominantly on English, limiting the understanding of LLM behavior in other languages. We address this gap by investigating Many-Shot Jailbreaking (MSJ) in Italian, underscoring the importance of understanding LLM behavior in different languages. We base our analysis on a newly created Italian dataset to identify unique safety vulnerabilities in 4 families of open-source LLMs.We find that the models exhibit unsafe behaviors even with minimal exposure to harmful prompts, and–more alarmingly–this tendency rapidly escalates with more demonstrations.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.29	Fabio Pernisi, Dirk Hovy, Paul R�ttger
On Improving Repository-Level Code QA for Large Language Models	Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Llama, or Mistral assist programmers as copilots and knowledge sources to make the coding process faster and more efficient. This paper aims to improve the copilot performance by implementing different self-alignment processes and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, as well as their combination. To test the effectiveness of all approaches, we create a dataset and apply a model-based evaluation, using LLM as a judge. It is designed to check the model's abilities to understand the source code semantics, the dependency between files, and the overall meta-information about the repository. We also compare our approach with other existing solutions, e.g. ChatGPT-3.5, and evaluate on the existing benchmarks.

A Computational Analysis and Exploration of Linguistic Borrowings in French Rap Lyrics	In France, linguistic borrowings in the relatively conservative French language are an important site of cultural debate, and rap in particular is a hotspot for borrowings. In this work, we use computational methods to understand the factors that affect the prominence and prevalence of a borrowing. To do so, we manually annotate a lexicon of over 700 borrowings occurring in this context (including key aspects for each borrowing such as origin and semantic class). We analyze the prevalence of these borrowings in a newly collected corpus of over 8000 French rap song lyrics and find that there are increases in the proportion of linguistic borrowings, interjections, and Niger-Congo borrowings while terms related to the arts are decreasing in prevalence. We release our code and data to facilitate further research in this area and discuss potential future directions.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.27	Lucas Zurbuchen, Rob Voigt
Action Inference for Destination Prediction in Vision-and-Language Navigation	Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) encompasses interacting with autonomous vehicles using language and visual input from the perspective of mobility.Most of the previous work in this field focuses on spatial reasoning and the semantic grounding of visual information.However, reasoning based on the actions of pedestrians in the scene is not much considered.In this study, we provide a VLN dataset for destination prediction with action inference to investigate the extent to which current VLN models perform action inference.We introduce a crowd-sourcing process to construct a dataset for this task in two steps: (1) collecting beliefs about the next action for a pedestrian and (2) annotating the destination considering the pedestrian's next action.Our benchmarking results of the models on destination prediction lead us to believe that the models can learn to reason about the effect of the action and the next action on the destination to a certain extent.However, there is still much scope for improvement.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.26	Anirudh Kondapally, Kentaro Yamada, Hitomi Yanaka

In this work, we present experiments on the automatic summarization of scientific articles using BART models, taking into account textual information coming from distinct passages from the long texts to be summarized. We demonstrate that taking into account document structure improves the performance of state-of-the-art models and approaches the performance of LongFormer on English.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.25	Eve Sauvage, Sabrina Campano, Lydia Ouali, Cyril Grouin
Exploring the Effectiveness and Consistency of Task Selection in Intermediate-Task Transfer Learning	Identifying beneficial tasks to transfer from is a critical step toward successful intermediate-task transfer learning. In this work, we experiment with 130 source-target task combinations and demonstrate that the transfer performance exhibits severe variance across different source tasks and training seeds, highlighting the crucial role of intermediate-task selection in a broader context. We compare four representative task selection methods in a unified setup, focusing on their effectiveness and consistency. Compared to embedding-free methods and text embeddings, task embeddings constructed from fine-tuned weights can better estimate task transferability by improving task prediction scores from 2.59% to 3.96%. Despite their strong performance, we observe that the task embeddings do not consistently demonstrate superiority for tasks requiring reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we introduce a novel method that measures pairwise token similarity using maximum inner product search, leading to the highest performance in task prediction. Our findings suggest that token-wise similarity is better predictive for predicting transferability compared to averaging weights.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.24	Pin-Jie Lin, Miaoran Zhang, Marius Mosbach, Dietrich Klakow
Knowledge Editing of Large Language Models Unconstrained by Word Order	Large Language Models (LLMs) are considered to have potentially extensive knowledge, but because their internal processing is black-boxed, it has been difficult to directly edit the knowledge held by the LLMs themselves. To address this issue, a method called local modification-based knowledge editing has been developed. This method identifies the knowledge neurons that encode the target knowledge and adjusts the parameters associated with these neurons to update the knowledge. Knowledge neurons are identified by masking the \it{o} part from sentences representing relational triplets ( \it{s, r, o} ), having the LLM predict the masked part, and observing the LLM�s activation during the prediction. When the architecture is decoder-based, the predicted \it{o} needs to be located at the end of the sentence. Previous local modification-based knowledge editing methods for decoder-based models have assumed SVO languages and faced challenges when applied to SOV languages such as Japanese. In this study, we propose a knowledge editing method that eliminates the need for word order constraints by converting the input for identifying knowledge neurons into a question where \it{o} is the answer. We conducted validation experiments on 500 examples and confirmed that the proposed method is effective for Japanese, a non-SVO language. We also applied this method to English, an SVO language, and demonstrated that it outperforms conventional methods.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.23	Ryoma Ishigaki, Jundai Suzuki, Masaki Shuzo, Eisaku Maeda
Assessing In-context Learning and Fine-tuning for Topic Classification of German Web Data	Researchers in the political and social sciences often rely on classification models to analyze trends in information consumption by examining browsing histories of millions of webpages. Automated scalable methods are necessary due to the impracticality of manual labeling. In this paper, we model the detection of topic-related content as a binary classification task and compare the accuracy of fine-tuned pre-trained encoder models against in-context learning strategies. Using only a few hundred annotated data points per topic, we detect content related to three German policies in a database of scraped webpages. We compare multilingual and monolingual models, as well as zero and few-shot approaches, and investigate the impact of negative sampling strategies and the combination of URL & content-based features. Our results show that a small sample of annotated data is sufficient to train an effective classifier. Fine-tuning encoder-based models yields better results than in-context learning. Classifiers using both URL & content-based features perform best, while using URLs alone provides adequate results when content is unavailable.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.22	Julian Schelb, Andreas Spitz, Roberto Ulloa
Narratives at Conflict: Computational Analysis of News Framing in Multilingual Disinformation Campaigns	Any report frames issues to favor a particular interpretation by highlighting or excluding certain aspects of a story. Despite the widespread use of framing in disinformation, framing properties and detection methods remain underexplored outside the English-speaking world. We explore how multilingual framing of the same issue differs systematically. We use eight years of Russia-backed disinformation campaigns, spanning 8k news articles in 4 languages targeting 15 countries. We find that disinformation campaigns consistently and intentionally favor specific framing, depending on the target language of the audience. We further discover how Russian-language articles consistently highlight selected frames depending on the region of the media coverage. We find that the two most prominent models for automatic frame analysis underperform and show high disagreement, highlighting the need for further research.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.21	Antonina Sinelnik, Dirk Hovy
Vector Spaces for Quantifying Disparity of Multiword Expressions in Annotated Text	Multiword Expressions (MWEs) make a goodcase study for linguistic diversity due to theiridiosyncratic nature. Defining MWE canonicalforms as types, diversity may be measurednotably through disparity, based on pairwisedistances between types. To this aim, wetrain static MWE-aware word embeddings forverbal MWEs in 14 languages, and we showinteresting properties of these vector spaces.We use these vector spaces to implement theso-called functional diversity measure. Weapply this measure to the results of severalMWE identification systems. We find that,although MWE vector spaces are meaningful ata local scale, the disparity measure aggregatingthem at a global scale strongly correlateswith the number of types, which questions itsusefulness in presence of simpler diversitymetrics such as variety. We make the vectorspaces we generated available.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.20	Louis Est�ve, Agata Savary, Thomas Lavergne
Label-Aware Automatic Verbalizer for Few-Shot Text Classification in Mid-To-Low Resource Languages	"Prompt-based learning has shown its effectiveness in few-shot text classification. A key factor in its success is a verbalizer, which translates output from a language model into a predicted class. Notably, the simplest and widely acknowledged verbalizer employs manual labels to represent the classes. However, manual selection may not yield the optimal words for a given language model, potentially leading to subpar classification performance, especially in mid-to-low resource languages with weaker language models. Therefore, we propose Label-Aware Automatic Verbalizer (LAAV), effectively augmenting manual labels for improved few-shot classification results. Specifically, we utilize the label name along with the conjunction ""and"" to induce the model to generate more effective words for the verbalizer. Experimental results on four mid-to-low resource Southeast Asian languages demonstrate that LAAV significantly outperforms existing verbalizers."	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.19	Thanakorn Thaminkaew, Piyawat Lertvittayakumjorn, Peerapon Vateekul
ANHALTEN: Cross-Lingual Transfer for German Token-Level Reference-Free Hallucination Detection	Research on token-level reference-free hallucination detection has predominantly focused on English, primarily due to the scarcity of robust datasets in other languages. This has hindered systematic investigations into the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer for this important NLP application. To address this gap, we introduce ANHALTEN, a new evaluation dataset that extends the English hallucination detection dataset to German. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores cross-lingual transfer for token-level reference-free hallucination detection. ANHALTEN contains gold annotations in German that are parallel (i.e., directly comparable to the original English instances). We benchmark several prominent cross-lingual transfer approaches, demonstrating that larger context length leads to better hallucination detection in German, even without succeeding context. Importantly, we show that the sample-efficient few-shot transfer is the most effective approach in most setups. This highlights the practical benefits of minimal annotation effort in the target language for reference-free hallucination detection. Aiming to catalyze future research on cross-lingual token-level reference-free hallucination detection, we make ANHALTEN publicly available: https://github.com/janekh24/anhalten	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.18	Janek Herrlein, Chia-Chien Hung, Goran Glava�
Automating Qualitative Data Analysis with Large Language Models	This PhD proposal aims to investigate ways of automating qualitative data analysis, specifically the thematic coding of texts. Despite existing methods vastly covered in literature, they mainly use Topic Modeling and other quantitative approaches which are far from resembling a human's analysis outcome. This proposal examines the limitations of current research in the field. It proposes a novel methodology based on Large Language Models to tackle automated coding and make it as close as possible to the results of human researchers. This paper covers studies already done in this field and their limitations, existing software, the problem of duplicating the researcher bias, and the proposed methodology.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.17	Angelina Parfenova, Alexander Denzler, Jörgen Pfeffer
Fine-Tuning ASR models for Very Low-Resource Languages: A Study on Mvskoke	Recent advancements in multilingual models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) have been able to achieve a high accuracy for languages with extremely limited resources. This study examines ASR modeling for the Mvskoke language, an indigenous language of America. The parameter efficiency of adapter training is contrasted with training entire models, and it is demonstrated how performance varies with different amounts of data. Additionally, the models are evaluated with trigram language model decoding, and the outputs are compared across different types of speech recordings. Results show that training an adapter is both parameter efficient and gives higher accuracy for a relatively small amount of data.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.16	Julia Mainzinger, Gina-Anne Levow
Demystifying Instruction Mixing for Fine-tuning Large Language Models	Instruction tuning significantly enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) across various tasks. However, the procedure to optimizing the mixing of instruction datasets for LLM fine-tuning is still poorly understood. This study categorizes instructions into three primary types: NLP downstream tasks, coding, and general chat. We explore the effects of instruction tuning on different combinations of datasets on LLM performance, and find that certain instruction types are more advantageous for specific applications but can negatively impact other areas. This work provides insights into instruction mixtures, laying the foundations for future research.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.15	Renxi Wang, Haonan Li, Minghao Wu, Yuxia Wang, Xudong Han, Chiyu Zhang, Timothy Baldwin
Plot Retrieval as an Assessment of Abstract Semantic Association	Retrieving relevant plots from the book for a query is a critical task, which can improve the reading experience and efficiency of readers. Readers usually only give an abstract and vague description as the query based on their own understanding, summaries, or speculations of the plot, which requires the retrieval model to have a strong ability to estimate the abstract semantic associations between the query and candidate plots. However, existing information retrieval (IR) datasets cannot reflect this ability well. In this paper, we propose PlotRetrieval, a labeled dataset to train and evaluate the performance of IR models on the novel task Plot Retrieval. Text pairs in PlotRetrieval have less word overlap and more abstract semantic association, which can reflect the ability of the IR models to estimate the abstract semantic association, rather than just traditional lexical or semantic matching. Extensive experiments across various lexical retrieval, sparse retrieval, dense retrieval, and cross-encoder methods compared with human studies on PlotRetrieval show current IR models still struggle in capturing abstract semantic association between texts. PlotRetrieval can be the benchmark for further research on the semantic association modeling ability of IR models.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.14	Shicheng Xu, Liang Pang, Jiangnan Li, Mo Yu, Fandong Meng, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng, Jie Zhou
ReMAG-KR: Retrieval and Medically Assisted Generation with Knowledge Reduction for Medical Question Answering	Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant potential for facilitating intelligent end-user applications in healthcare. However, hallucinations remain an inherent problem with LLMs, making it crucial to address this issue with extensive medical knowledge and data. In this work, we propose a Retrieve-and-Medically-Augmented-Generation with Knowledge Reduction (ReMAG-KR) pipeline, employing a carefully curated knowledge base using cross-encoder re-ranking strategies. The pipeline is tested on medical MCQ-based QA datasets as well as general QA datasets. It was observed that when the knowledge base is reduced, the model's performance decreases by 2-8%, while the inference time improves by 47%.	https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-srw.13	Sidhaarth Murali, Sowmya S., Supreetha R
SciMind: A Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts Model for Advancing Pharmaceutical Sciences	Large language models (LLMs) have made substantial strides, but their use in reliably tackling issues within specialized domains, particularly in interdisciplinary areas like pharmaceutical sciences, is hindered by data heterogeneity, knowledge complexity, unique objectives, and a spectrum of constraint conditions. In this area, diverse modalities such as nucleic acids, proteins, molecular structures, and natural language are often involved. We designed a specialized token set and introduced a new Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) pre-training and fine-tuning strategy to unify these modalities in one model. With this strategy, we've created a multi-modal mixture-of-experts foundational model for pharmaceutical sciences, named SciMind. This model has undergone extensive pre-training on publicly accessible datasets including nucleic acid sequences, protein sequences, molecular structure strings, and biomedical texts, and delivers good performance on biomedical text comprehension, promoter prediction, protein function prediction, molecular description, and molecular generation.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=xbyPquFUB4	Zhaoping Xiong, Xintao Fang, Haotian CHU, Xiaozhe Wan, Liwei Liu, Yameng Li, Wenkai Xiang, Mingyue Zheng
ChatMol Copilot: An Agent for Molecular Modeling and Computation Powered by LLMs	Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT excel at diverse tasks when given explicit instructions, yet they often struggle with specialized domains such as molecular science, lacking in-depth reasoning and sophisticated planning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce ChatMol Copilot, a chatbot-like agent specifically engineered for protein design and small molecule computations. ChatMol Copilot employs a multi-level abstraction framework to expand the LLM's capability. At the basic level, it integrates external computational tools through function calls, thus offloading complex tasks and enabling a focus on strategic decision-making. The second level is data abstraction. Large data sets (such as a large number of molecules created by a generative model) are stored in Redis cache, and the redis keys are referenced by LLMs for data sources involved in computation. The third level of abstraction allows the LLM to orchestrate these tools, either directly or via dynamically generated Python executables. Our evaluations demonstrate that ChatMol Copilot can adeptly manage molecular modeling tasks, effectively utilizing a variety of tools as directed. By simplifying access to sophisticated molecular modeling resources, ChatMol Copilot stands to significantly accelerate drug discovery and biotechnological innovation, empowering biochemists with advanced, user-friendly AI capabilities.

GLaD: Synergizing Molecular Graphs and Language Descriptors for Enhanced Power Conversion Efficiency Prediction in Organic Photovoltaic Devices	This paper presents a novel approach for predicting Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) of Organic Photovoltaic (OPV) devices, called GLaD: synergizing molecular Graphs and Language Descriptors for enhanced PCE prediction. Due to the lack of high-quality experimental data, we collect a dataset consisting of 500 pairs of OPV donor and acceptor molecules along with their corresponding PCE values, which we utilize as the training data for our predictive model. In this low-data regime, GLaD leverages properties learned from large language models (LLMs) pretrained on extensive scientific literature to enrich molecular structural representations, allowing for a multimodal representation of molecules. GLaD achieves precise predictions of PCE, thereby facilitating the synthesis of new OPV molecules with improved efficiency. Furthermore, GLaD showcases versatility, as it applies to a range of molecular property prediction tasks (BBBP, BACE, ClinTox and SIDER), not limited to those concerning OPV materials. Especially, GLaD proves valuable for tasks in low-data regimes within the chemical space, as it enriches molecular representations by incorporating molecular property descriptions learned from large-scale pretraining. This capability is significant in real-world scientific endeavors like drug and material discovery, where access to comprehensive data is crucial for informed decision-making and efficient exploration of the chemical space.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=nZMGwkaLbS	Thao Nguyen, Tiara Torres-Flores, Changhyun Hwang, Carl Edwards, Ying Diao, Heng Ji
Lang2Mol-Diff: A Diffusion-Based Generative Model for Language-to-Molecule Translation Leveraging SELFIES Representation	Generating de novo molecules from textual descriptions is challenging due to potential issues with molecule validity in SMILES representation and limitations of autoregressive models. This work introduces Lang2Mol-Diff, a diffusion-based language-to-molecule generative model using the SELFIES representation. Specifically, Lang2Mol-Diff leverages the strengths of two state-of-the-art molecular generative models: BioT5 and TGM-DLM. By employing BioT5 to tokenize the SELFIES representation, Lang2Mol-Diff addresses the validity issues associated with SMILES strings. Additionally, it incorporates a text diffusion mechanism from TGM-DLM to overcome the limitations of autoregressive models in this domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to leverage the diffusion mechanism for text-based de novo molecule generation using the SELFIES molecular string representation. Performance evaluation on the L+M-24 benchmark dataset shows that Lang2Mol-Diff outperforms all existing methods for molecule generation in terms of validity.

Design Proteins Using Large Language Models: Enhancements and Comparative Analyses	Pre-trained LLMs have demonstrated substantial capabilities across a range of conventional natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as summarization and entity recognition. In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs in the generation of high-quality protein sequences. Specifically, we adopt a suite of pre-trained LLMs, including Mistral-7B (https://huggingface.co/Kamyar-zeinalipour/P-Mistral-7B), Llama-2-7B (https://huggingface.co/Kamyar-zeinalipour/P-Llama2-7B), Llama-3-8B (https://huggingface.co/Kamyar-zeinalipour/P-Llama3-8B), and gemma-7B (https://huggingface.co/Kamyar-zeinalipour/P-gemma-7B), to produce valid protein sequences. All of these models are publicly available (https://github.com/KamyarZeinalipour/protein-design-LLMs). Unlike previous work in this field, our approach utilizes a relatively small dataset comprising 42,000 distinct human protein sequences. We retrain these models to process protein-related data, ensuring the generation of biologically feasible protein structures. Our findings demonstrate that even with limited data, the adapted models exhibit efficiency comparable to established protein-focused models such as ProGen varieties, ProtGPT2, and ProLLaMA, which were trained on millions of protein sequences. To validate and quantify the performance of our models, we conduct comparative analyses employing standard metrics such as pLDDT, RMSD, TM-score, and REU. Furthermore, we commit to making the trained versions of all four models publicly available, fostering greater transparency and collaboration in the field of computational biology.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=izmveZ1qcS	Kamyar Zeinalipour, Neda Jamshidi, Monica Bianchini, Marco Maggini, Marco Gori
Could Chemical Language Models benefit from Message Passing	Pretrained language models (LMs) showcase significant capabilities in processing molecular text, while concurrently, message passing neural networks (MPNNs) demonstrate resilience and versatility in the domain of molecular science. Despite these advancements, we find there are limited studies investigating the bidirectional interactions between molecular structures and their corresponding textual representations. Therefore, in this paper, we propose two strategies to evaluate whether an information integration can enhance the performance: contrast learning, which involves utilizing an MPNN to supervise the training of the LM, and fusion, which exploits information from both models. Our empirical analysis reveals that the integration approaches exhibit superior performance compared to baselines when applied to smaller molecular graphs, while these integration approaches do not yield performance enhancements on large scale graphs.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=hbcZ3uWT1Q	Jiaqing Xie, Ziheng Chi
LlaSMol: Advancing Large Language Models for Chemistry with a Large-Scale, Comprehensive, High-Quality Instruction Tuning Dataset	Chemistry plays a crucial role in many domains, such as drug discovery and material science. While large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 exhibit remarkable capabilities on natural language processing tasks, existing research indicates that their performance on chemistry tasks is discouragingly low. In this paper, however, we demonstrate that our developed LLMs can achieve very strong results on a comprehensive set of chemistry tasks, outperforming the most advanced GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus by a substantial margin. To accomplish this, we propose SMolInstruct, a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality dataset for instruction tuning. It contains 14 selected chemistry tasks and over three million samples, laying a solid foundation for training and evaluating LLMs for chemistry. Using SMolInstruct, we fine-tune a set of open-source LLMs named as LlaSMol, among which, we find that Mistral serves as the best base model for chemistry tasks. Our analysis further demonstrates the critical role of the proposed dataset in driving the performance improvements.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=hIaQWoVSFo	Botao Yu, Frazier N.

Repurformer: Transformers for Repurposing-Aware Molecule Generation	Generating as diverse molecules as possible with desired properties is crucial for drug discovery research, which invokes many approaches based on deep generative models today. Despite recent advancements in these models, particularly in variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), Transformers, and diffusion models, a significant challenge known as the sample bias problem remains. This problem occurs when generated molecules targeting the same protein tend to be structurally similar, reducing the diversity of generation. To address this, we propose leveraging multi-hop relationships among proteins and compounds. Our model, Repurformer, integrates bi-directional pretraining with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and low-pass filtering (LPF) to capture complex interactions and generate diverse molecules. A series of experiments on BindingDB dataset confirm that Repurformer successfully creates substitutes for anchor compounds that resemble positive compounds, increasing diversity between the anchor and generated compounds.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=d2y1gfEEEB	Changhun Lee, Gyumin Lee
Mol2Lang-VLM: Vision- and Text-Guided Generative Pre-trained Language Models for Advancing Molecule Captioning through Multimodal Fusion	This paper introduces Mol2Lang-VLM, an enhanced method for refining generative pre-trained language models for molecule captioning using multimodal features to achieve more accurate caption generation. Our approach leverages the encoder and decoder blocks of the Transformer-based architecture by introducing third sub-layers into both. Specifically, we insert sub-layers in the encoder to fuse features from SELFIES strings and molecular images, while the decoder fuses features from SMILES strings and their corresponding descriptions. Moreover, cross multi-head attention is employed instead of common multi-head attention to enable the decoder to attend to the encoder's output, thereby integrating the encoded contextual information for better and more accurate caption generation. Performance evaluation on the CheBI-20 and L+M-24 benchmark datasets demonstrates Mol2Lang-VLM's superiority, achieving higher accuracy and quality in caption generation compared to existing methods.

ALMol: Aligned Language-Molecule Translation LLMs through Offline Preference Contrastive Optimisation	The field of chemistry and Artificial Intelligence (AI) intersection is an area of active research that aims to accelerate scientific discovery. The integration of large language models (LLMs) with scientific modalities has shown significant promise in this endeavour. However, challenges persist in effectively addressing training efficacy and the out-of-distribution problem, particularly as existing approaches rely on larger models and datasets. In this context, we focus on machine language-molecule translation and deploy a novel training approach called contrastive preference optimisation, which avoids generating translations that are merely adequate but not perfect. To ensure generalisability and mitigate memorisation effects, we conduct experiments using only 10% of the data. Our results demonstrate that our models achieve up to a 32\% improvement compared to counterpart models. Finally, we introduce a fine-grained, domain-agnostic evaluation method to assess hallucination in LLMs and promote responsible use.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=a5Vx6D0pvp	Dimitris Gkoumas
Evaluating Extrapolation Ability of Large Language Model in Chemical Domain	Solving a problem outside the training space, i.e. extrapolation, has been a long problem in the machine learning community. The current success of large language models demonstrates the LLM's extrapolation ability to several unseen tasks. In line with these works, we evaluate the LLM's extrapolation ability in the chemical domain. We construct a data set measuring the material properties of epoxy polymers depending on various raw materials and curing processes. LLM should predict the material property when novel raw material is introduced utilizing its chemical knowledge. Through experiments, LLM tends to choose the right direction of adjustment but fails to determine the exact degree, resulting in poor MAE on some properties. But LLM can successfully adjust the degree with only a one-shot example. The results show that LLM can extrapolate to new unseen material utilizing its chemical knowledge learned through massive pre-training.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=XQLdeqoLtc	Taehun Cha, Donghun Lee
Molecule Language Model with Augmented Pairs and Expertise Transfer	Understanding the molecules and their textual descriptions via molecule language models (MoLM) recently got a surge of interest among researchers. However, unique challenges exist in the field of MoLM due to 1) a limited amount of molecule-text paired data and 2) missing expertise that occurred due to the specialized areas of focus among the experts. To this end, we propose AMOLE, which 1) augments molecule-text pairs with structural similarity preserving loss, and 2) transfers the expertise between the molecules. Extensive experiments on various downstream tasks demonstrate the superiority of AMOLE in comprehending molecules and their descriptions, highlighting its potential for application in real-world drug discovery.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=Wa4w2B9JFY	Namkyeong Lee, Siddhartha Laghuvarapu, Chanyoung Park, Jimeng Sun
Extracting Materials Science Data from Scientific Tables	Advances in materials science depend on leveraging data from the vast published literature. Extracting detailed data and metadata from these publications is challenging, leading current data repositories to rely on newly created data in narrow domains. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a new opportunity to rapidly and accurately extract data and insights from the published literature, transforming it into structured formats for easy querying and reuse. This paper explores using LLMs for autonomous data extraction from materials science articles, focusing on polymer composites to demonstrate successes and challenges in extracting tabular data. We explored different table representations for use with LLMs, finding that a multimodal model with an image input yielded the most promising results. This model achieved an accuracy score of 0.910 for composition information extraction, which includes polymer names, molecule names used as fillers, and their respective compositions. Additionally, it achieved an F$_1$ score of 0.863 for property name information extraction. With the most conservative evaluation for the property extraction requiring exact match in all the details we obtained an F$_1$ score of 0.419. We observed that by allowing varying degrees of flexibility in the evaluation, the score can increase to 0.769. We envision that the results and analysis from this study will promote further research directions in developing information extraction strategies from materials information sources.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=KzVJFYLCtt	Defne Circi, Ghazal Khalighinejad, Anlan Chen, Bhuwan Dhingra, L.

DNA Language Model and Interpretable Graph Neural Network Identify Genes and Pathways Involved in Rare Diseases	Identification of causal genes and pathways is a critical step for understanding the genetic underpinnings of rare diseases. We propose novel approaches to gene prioritization and pathway identification using DNA language model, graph neural networks, and genetic algorithm. Using HyenaDNA, a long-range genomic foundation model, we generated dynamic gene embeddings that reflect changes caused by deleterious variants. These gene embeddings were then utilized to identify candidate genes and pathways. We validated our method on a cohort of rare disease patients with partially known genetic diagnosis, demonstrating the re-identification of known causal genes and pathways and the detection of novel candidates. These findings have implications for the prevention and treatment of rare diseases by enabling targeted identification of new drug targets and therapeutic pathways.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=JzaaBPMEJP	Ali Saadat, Jacques Fellay
NLPeople at \textit{L+M-24} Shared Task: An Ensembled Approach for Molecule Captioning from SMILES	This paper presents our approach submitted to the Language + Molecules 2024 (\textit{L+M-24}) Shared Task in the Molecular Captioning track. The task involves generating captions that describe the properties of molecules that are provided in SMILES format. We propose a method for the task that decomposes the challenge of generating captions from SMILES into a classification problem, where we first predict the molecule's properties. The molecules whose properties can be predicted with high accuracy show high translation metric scores in the caption generation by LLMs, while others produce low scores. Then we use the predicted properties to select the captions generated by different types of LLMs, and use that prediction as the final output. Our submission achieved an overall increase score of 15.21 on the dev set and 12.30 on the evaluation set, based on translation metrics and property metrics from the baseline.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=HpN2iaWmt6	Shinnosuke Tanaka, Carol Mak, Flaviu Cipcigan, James Barry, Mohab Elkaref, Movina Moses, Vishnudev Kuruvanthodi, Geeth De Mel

The task involves ``translating'' between molecules and natural language, including molecule captioning and text-based molecule generation using the \textit{L+M-24} dataset. Our method consists of three stages. In the first stage, we distill data from various models. In the second stage, combined with \textit{extra} version of the provided dataset, we train diverse models for subsequent voting ensemble. We also adopt Transductive Ensemble Learning (TEL) to enhance these base models. Lastly, all models are integrated using a voting ensemble method.

Knowlab's Submission to L+M Shared Task: All you need is continued pretraining of \\chemistry texts even for molecule captioning	This paper presents our submission to the L+M-24 shared task, focused on translating molecular structures into natural language descriptions, known as the molecule captioning task. We selected a small language model (SLM), Phi-3-mini-4k, to evaluate the impact of continued pretraining and instruction tuning for domain-specific chemical knowledge. The Phi-3 model was continued pretrained with 90M chemistry textbooks and abstracts, followed by instruction tuning on 150K question answering sets of SMILES and general chemistry knowledge. Despite the continued pretraining phase not including direct exposure to SMILES representations, it significantly enhanced the Phi-3 model's performance, a 300\% increase for the BLEU scores, in the molecule captioning task. The code and model are released at \url{https://github.com/bluesky333/Phi3KnowChem} to facilitate research in chemical small language modeling.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=5lpwW4ZGO9	Yunsoo Kim, Honghan Wu
Knowledge Graph Extraction from Total Synthesis Documents	Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful tool for organizing and integrating complex information, making it a suitable format for scientific knowledge. However, translating scientific knowledge into KGs is challenging as a wide variety of styles and elements to present data and ideas is used. Although efforts for KG extraction (KGE) from scientific documents exist, evaluation remains challenging and field-dependent; and existing benchmarks do not focuse on scientific information. Furthermore, establishing a general benchmark for this task is challenging as not all scientific knowledge has a ground-truth KG representation, making any benchmark prone to ambiguity. Here we propose Graph of Organic Synthesis Benchmark (GOSyBench), a benchmark for KG extraction from scientific documents in chemistry, that leverages the native KG-like structure of synthetic routes in organic chemistry. We develop KG-extraction algorithms based on LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Mistral) and VLMs (GPT-4o), the best of which reaches 73% recovery accuracy and 59% precision, leaving a lot of room for improvement. We expect GOSyBench can serve as a valuable resource for evaluating and advancing KGE methods in the scientific domain, ultimately facilitating better organization, integration, and discovery of scientific knowledge.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=0QvfkPHtXC	Andres M Bran, Zlatko Jončev, Philippe Schwaller
Language-guided World Models: A Model-based Approach to AI Control	Developing internal world models for artificial agents opens an efficient channel for humans to communicate with and control them. In addition to updating policies, humans can modify the world models of these agents in order to influence their decisions. The challenge, however, is that currently existing world models are difficult for humans to adapt because they lack a natural communication interface. Aimed at addressing this shortcoming, we develop *Language-Guided World Models* (LWMs), which can capture environment dynamics by reading language descriptions. These models enhance agent communication efficiency, allowing humans to simultaneously alter their behavior on multiple tasks with concise language feedback. They also enable agents to self-learn from texts originally written to instruct humans. To facilitate the development of LWMs, we design a challenging benchmark based on the game of MESSENGER (Hanjie et al., 2021), requiring compositional generalization to new language descriptions and environment dynamics. Our experiments reveal that the current state-of-the-art Transformer architecture performs poorly on this benchmark, motivating us to design a more robust architecture. To showcase the practicality of our proposed LWMs, we simulate a scenario where these models augment the interpretability and safety of an agent by enabling it to generate and discuss plans with a human before execution. By effectively incorporating language feedback on the plan, the models boost the agent performance in the real environment by up to three times without collecting any interactive experiences in this environment.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=zFb0kZjjrj	Alex L Zhang, Khanh Xuan Nguyen, Jens Tuyls, Albert Lin, Karthik R Narasimhan
Embodied Language Learning: Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Directions	While large language and vision-language models showcase impressive capabilities, they face a notable limitation: the inability to connect language with the physical world. To bridge this gap, research has focused on embodied language learning, where the language learner is situated in the world, perceives it, and interacts with it. This article explores the current standing of research in embodied language learning, highlighting opportunities and discussing common challenges. Lastly, it identifies existing gaps from the perspective of language understanding research within the embodied world and suggests potential future directions.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=wkSlUzSAXF	Nadine Amin, Julia Rayz
Collection  of Japanese Route Information Reference Expressions Using Maps as Stimuli	We constructed a database of Japanese expressions based on route information. Using 20 maps as stimuli, we requested descriptions of routes between two points on each map from 40 individuals per route, collecting 1600 route information reference expressions. We determined whether the expressions were based solely on relative reference expressions by using landmarks on the maps. In cases in which only relative reference expressions were used, we labeled the presence or absence of information regarding the starting point, waypoints, and destination. Additionally, we collected clarity ratings for each expression using a survey.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=t7FbJ6zQpd	Yoshiko Kawabata, Mai Omura, Hikari Konishi, Masayuki Asahara, Johane Takeuchi
TopViewRS: Vision-Language Models as Top-View Spatial Reasoners	Top-view perspective denotes a typical way in which humans read and reason over different types of maps, and it is vital for localization and navigation of humans as well as of 'non-human' agents, such as the ones backed by large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Nonetheless, spatial reasoning capabilities of modern VLMs remain unattested and underexplored. In this work, we thus study their capability to understand and reason over spatial relations from the top view. The focus on top view also enables controlled evaluations at different granularity of spatial reasoning; we clearly disentangle different abilities (e.g., recognizing particular objects versus understanding their relative positions). We introduce the TopViewRS (Top-View Reasoning in Space) dataset, consisting of 11,384 multiple-choice questions with either realistic or semantic top-view map as visual input. We then use it to study and evaluate VLMs across 4 perception and reasoning tasks with different levels of complexity. Evaluation of 10 representative open- and closed-source VLMs reveals the gap of more than 50% compared to average human performance, and it is even lower than the random baseline in some cases. Although additional experiments show that Chain-of-Thought reasoning can boost model capabilities by 5.82% on average, the overall performance of VLMs remains limited. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced model capability in top-view spatial reasoning and set a foundation for further research towards human-level proficiency of VLMs in real-world multimodal tasks.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=g9kQpTv6gK	Chengzu Li, Caiqi Zhang, Han Zhou, Nigel Collier, Anna Korhonen, Ivan Vulić
Into the Unknown: Generating Geospatial Descriptions for New Environments	Similar to vision-and-language navigation (VLN) tasks that focus on bridging the gap between vision and language for embodied navigation, the new Rendezvous (RVS) task requires reasoning over allocentric spatial relationships using non-sequential navigation instructions and maps. However, performance substantially drops in new environments with no training data. Using opensource descriptions paired with coordinates (e.g., Wikipedia) provides training data but suffers from limited spatially-oriented text resulting in low geolocation resolution. We propose a large-scale augmentation method for generating high-quality synthetic data for new environments using readily available geospatial data. Our method constructs a grounded knowledge-graph, capturing entity relationships. Sampled entities and relations (``shop north of school'') generate navigation instructions via (i) generating numerous templates using context-free grammar (CFG) to embed specific entities and relations; (ii) feeding the entities and relation into a large language model (LLM) for instruction generation. A comprehensive evaluation on RVS, showed that our approach improves the 100-meter accuracy by 45.83% on unseen environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models trained with CFG-based augmentation achieve superior performance compared with those trained with LLM-based augmentation, both in unseen and seen environments. These findings suggest that the potential advantages of explicitly structuring spatial information for text-based geospatial reasoning in previously unknown, can unlock data-scarce scenarios.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=emQgOx1VxD	Tzuf Paz-Argaman, John Palowitch, SAYALI KULKARNI, Reut Tsarfaty, Jason Michael Baldridge
Learning Communication Policies for Different Follower Behaviors in a Collaborative Reference Game	In this work, we evaluate the adaptability of neural agents towards assumed partner behaviors in a collaborative reference game. In this game, success is achieved when a knowledgeable guide can verbally lead a follower to the selection of a specific puzzle piece among several distractors. We frame this language grounding and coordination task as a reinforcement learning problem and measure to which extent a common reinforcement training algorithm (PPO) is able to produce neural agents (the guides) that perform well with various heuristic follower behaviors that vary along the dimensions of confidence and autonomy. We experiment with a learning signal that in addition to the goal condition also respects an assumed communicative effort. Our results indicate that this novel ingredient leads to communicative strategies that are less verbose (staying silent in some of the steps) and that with respect to that the guide's strategies indeed adapt to the partner's level of confidence and autonomy.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=cgKGlDzAwl	Philipp Sadler, Sherzod Hakimov, David Schlangen
Tuning Language Models with Spatial Logic for Complex Reasoning	Recent research shows that more data and larger models can provide more accurate solutions to natural language problems that require reasoning. However, models can easily fail to provide solutions in unobserved levels of compositional complexity because they might not obtain the level of abstraction needed for generalizability. To alleviate this issue, we propose to train the models with neuro-symbolic techniques that can exploit the logical rules of reasoning as constraints and provide additional supervision sources to the model. Training models to adhere to the regulations of reasoning pushes them to make more effective abstractions needed for generalizability and transfer learning. We focus on a challenging problem of spatial reasoning over text, and our results on multiple benchmarks confirm our hypothesis of effective domain transfer based on neuro-symbolic training. We utilize our symbolic training approach on multiple commonly used language models.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=cDm7zGenhZ	Tanawan Premsri, Parisa Kordjamshidi
Learning Adverbs with Spectral Mixture Kernels	"For humans and robots to collaborate more in the real world, robots need to understand human intentions from the different manner of their behaviors. In this study, we focus on the meaning of adverbs which describe human motions. We propose a topic model, Hierarchical Dirichlet Process-Spectral Mixture Latent Dirichlet Allocation, which concurrently learns the relationship between human motions and adverbs by capturing the frequency kernels that represent motion characteristics and the shared topics of adverbs to depict such motions. We trained the model on datasets we made from movies about ""walking"" and ""dancing"", and found that our model outperforms representative neural network models in terms of perplexity score. We also demonstrate our model's ability to estimate suitable adverbs for a given motion automatically extracted from a movie."	https://openreview.net/forum?id=aeFuSvh0iY	Tomoe Taniguchi, Ichiro Kobayashi, Daichi Mochihashi
Natural Language Can Facilitate Sim2Real Transfer	The main challenge in learning image-conditioned robotic policies is acquiring a visual representation conducive to low-level control. Due to the high dimensionality of the image space, learning a good visual representation requires a considerable amount of visual data. However, when learning in the real world, data is expensive. Sim2Real is a promising paradigm for overcoming data scarcity in the real-world target domain by using a simulator to collect large amounts of cheap data closely related to the target task. However, it is difficult to transfer an image-conditioned policy from sim to real when the domains are very visually dissimilar. To bridge the sim2real visual gap, we propose using natural language descriptions of images as a unifying signal across domains that captures the underlying task-relevant semantics. Our key insight is that if two image observations from different domains are labeled with similar language, the policy should predict similar action distributions for both images. We demonstrate that training the image encoder to predict the language description or the distance between descriptions of a sim or real image serves as a useful, data-efficient pretraining step that helps learn a domain-invariant image representation. We can then use this image encoder as the backbone of an IL policy trained simultaneously on a large amount of simulated and a handful of real demonstrations. Our approach outperforms widely used prior sim2real methods and strong vision-language pretraining baselines by 25 to 40%.

LangSuit·E: Planning, Controlling and Interacting with Large Language Models in Embodied Text Environments	"Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown inspiring achievements in constructing autonomous agents that rely on language descriptions as inputs. However, it remains unclear how well LLMs can function as few-shot or zero-shot embodied agents in dynamic interactive environments. To address this gap, we introduce LangSuit·E, a versatile and simulation-free testbed featuring 6 representative embodied tasks in textual embodied worlds. Compared with previous LLM-based testbed, LangSuit·E (i) offers adaptability to diverse environments without multiple simulation engines, (ii) evaluates agents' capacity to develop ""internalized world knowledge"" with embodied observations, and (iii) allows easy customization of communication and action strategies. To address the embodiment challenge, we devise a novel chain-of-thought (CoT) schema, EmMem, which summarizes embodied states w.r.t. history information. Comprehensive benchmark results illustrate challenges and insights of embodied planning. LangSuit·E represents a significant step toward building embodied generalists in the context of language models."	https://openreview.net/forum?id=7T7kJhAVKw	Zixia Jia, Mengmeng Wang, Baichen Tong, Wentao Ding, Zilong Zheng
Climate Policy Transformer: Utilizing NLP to track the coherence of Climate Policy Documents in the Context of the Paris Agreement	Climate policy implementation is pivotal in global efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. In this context, this paper explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) as a tool for policy advisors to efficiently track and assess climate policy and strategies, such as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). These documents are essential for monitoring coherence with the Paris Agreement, yet their analysis traditionally demands significant la- bor and time. We demonstrate how to leverage NLP on existing climate policy databases to transform this process by structuring informa- tion extracted from these otherwise unstruc- tured policy documents and opening avenues for a more in-depth analysis of national and re- gional policies. Central to our approach is the creation of a machine-learning (ML) dataset 'CPo-CD', based on data provided by the Inter- national Climate Initiative (IKI) and Climate Watch (CW). The CPo-CD dataset is utilized to fine-tune Transformer Models on classify- ing climate targets, actions, policies, and plans, along with their sector, mitigation-adaptation, and greenhouse gas (GHG) components. We publish our model and dataset on a Hugging Face repository.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=zFGSLIUEkV	Prashant Pratap Singh, Erik Lehmann, Mark Tyrrell
Granular Analysis of Social Media Users’ Truthfulness Stances Toward Climate Change Factual Claims	Climate change poses an urgent global problem that requires efficient data analysis mechanisms to provide insights into climate-related discussions on social media platforms. This paper presents a framework aimed at understanding social media users' perceptions of various climate change topics and uncovering the insights behind these perceptions. Our framework employs large language model to develop a taxonomy of factual claims related to climate change and build a classification model that detects the truthfulness stance of tweets toward the factual claims. The findings reveal two key conclusions: (1) The public tends to believe the claims are true, regardless of the actual claim veracity; (2) The public shows a lack of discernment between facts and misinformation across different topics, particularly in areas related to politics, economy, and environment.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=sJ4V4uyF02	Haiqi Zhang, Zhengyuan Zhu, Zeyu Zhang, Jacob Devasier, Chengkai Li

Informing climate risk analysis using textual information - A research agenda	We present a research agenda focused on efficiently extracting, assuring quality, and consolidating textual company sustainability information to address urgent climate change decision-making needs. Starting from the goal to create integrated FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) climate-related data, we identify research needs pertaining to the technical aspects of information extraction as well as to the design of the integrated sustainability datasets that we seek to compile. Regarding extraction, we leverage technological advancements, particularly in large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, to unlock the underutilized potential of unstructured textual information contained in corporate sustainability reports. In applying these techniques, we review key challenges, which include the retrieval and extraction of CO$_2$ emission values from PDF documents, especially from unstructured tables and graphs therein, and the validation of automatically extracted data through comparisons with human-annotated values. We also review how existing use cases and practices in climate risk analytics relate to choices of what textual information should be extracted and how it could be linked to existing structured data.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=qeskvBnCXP	Andreas Dimmelmeier, Hendrik Christian Doll, Malte Schierholz, Emily Kormanyos, Maurice Fehr, Bolei Ma, Jacob Beck, Alexander Fraser, Frauke Kreuter
My Climate Advisor: An Application of NLP in Climate Adaptation for Agriculture	Climate adaptation in the agricultural sector necessitates tools that equip farmers and farm advisors with relevant and trustworthy information to help increase their resiliency to climate change. We introduce {\em My Climate Advisor}, a question-answering (QA) prototype that synthesises information from different data sources, such as peer-reviewed scientific literature and high-quality, industry-relevant grey literature to generate answers, with references, to a given user's question. Our prototype uses open-source generative models for data privacy and intellectual property protection, and retrieval augmented generation for answer generation, grounding and provenance. While there are standard evaluation metrics for QA systems, no existing evaluation framework suits our LLM-based QA application in the climate adaptation domain. We design an evaluation framework with seven metrics based on the requirements of the domain experts to judge the generated answers from 12 different LLM-based models. Our initial evaluations through a user study via domain experts show promising usability results.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=ldUFMF79it	Vincent Nguyen, Sarvnaz Karimi, Willow Hallgren, Ashley Harkin, Mahesh Prakash
Challenges in End-to-End Policy Extraction from Climate Action Plans	Gray policy literature such as climate action plans (CAPs) provide an information-rich resource with potential to inform analysis and decision-making. However, these corpora are currently underutilized due to the substantial manual effort and expertise required to sift through long and detailed documents. Automatically structuring relevant information using information extraction (IE) would be useful for assisting policy scientists in synthesizing vast gray policy corpora to identify relevant entities, concepts and themes. LLMs have demonstrated strong performance on IE tasks in the few-shot setting, but it is unclear whether these gains transfer to gray policy literature which differs significantly to traditional benchmark datasets in several aspects, such as format of information content, length of documents, and inconsistency of document structure. We perform a case study on end-to-end IE with California CAPs, inspecting the performance of state-of-the-art tools for: (1) extracting content from CAPs into structured markup segments; (2) few-shot IE with LLMs; and (3) the utility of extracted entities for downstream analyses. We identify challenges at several points of the end-to-end IE pipeline for CAPs, and we provide recommendations for open problems centered around representing rich non-textual elements, document structure, flexible annotation schemes, and global information. Tackling these challenges would make it possible to realize the potential of LLMs for IE with gray policy literature.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=lO22pyR0OY	Nupoor Gandhi, Tom Corringham, Emma Strubell
SDG target detection in environmental reports using Retrieval-augmented Generation with LLMs	With the consolidation of Large Language Models (LLM) as a dominant component in approaches for multiple linguistic tasks, the interest in these technologies has greatly increased within a variety of areas and domains. A particular scenario of information needs where to exploit these approaches is climate-aware NLP. Paradigmatically, the vast manual labour of inspecting long, heterogeneous documents to find environment-relevant expressions and claims suits well within a recently established Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) framework. In this paper, we tackle two dual problems within environment analysis dealing with the common goal of detecting a Sustainable Developmental Goal (SDG) target being addressed in a textual passage of an environmental assessment report. We develop relevant test collections, and propose and evaluate a series of methods within the general RAG pipeline, in order to assess the current capabilities of LLMs for the tasks of SDG target evidence identification and SDG target detection.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=hKCxod4Sim	Dario Garigliotti
Using LLMs to Build a Database of Climate Extreme Impacts	To better understand how extreme climate events impact society, we need to increase the availability of accurate and comprehensive information about these impacts. We propose a method for building large-scale databases of climate extreme impacts from online textual sources, using LLMs for information extraction in combination with more traditional NLP techniques to improve accuracy and consistency. We evaluate the method against a small benchmark database created by human experts and find that extraction accuracy varies for different types of information. We compare three different LLMs and find that, while the commercial GPT-4 model gives the best performance overall, the open-source models Mistral and Mixtral are competitive for some types of information.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=h7o0qyQ0rt	Ni Li, Shorouq Zahra, Mariana Madruga de Brito, Clare Marie Flynn, Olof Görnerup, Koffi Worou, Murathan Kurfali, Chanjuan Meng, Wim Thiery, Jakob Zscheischler, Gabriele Messori, Joakim Nivre
Structuring Sustainability Reports for Environmental Standards with LLMs guided by Ontology	Following the introduction of the European Sustainability Reporting Standard (ESRS), companies will have to adapt to a new policy and provide mandatory sustainability reports. However, implementing such reports entails a challenge, such as the comprehension of a large number of textual information from various sources. This task can be accelerated by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) and ontologies to effectively model the domain knowledge. In this study, we extended an existing ontology to model ESRS Topical Standard for disclosure. The developed ontology would enable automated reasoning over the data and assist in constructing Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Moreover, the proposed ontology extension would also help to identify gaps in companies' sustainability reports with regard to the ESRS requirements. Additionally, we extracted knowledge from corporate sustainability reports via LLMs guided with a proposed ontology and developed their KG representation.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=dvYC5TwFqa	Aida Usmanova, Ricardo Usbeck
Statements: Universal Information Extraction from Tables with Large Language Models for ESG KPIs	Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) KPIs assess an organization's performance on issues such as climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, waste management, human rights, diversity, and policies. ESG reports convey this valuable quantitative information through tables. Unfortunately, extracting this information is difficult due to high variability in the table structure as well as content. We propose Statements, a novel domain agnostic data structure for extracting quantitative facts and related information. We propose translating tables to statements as a new supervised deep-learning universal information extraction task. We introduce SemTabNet - a dataset of over 100K annotated tables. Investigating a family of T5-based Statement Extraction Models, our best model generates statements which are 82% similar to the ground-truth (compared to baseline of 21%). We demonstrate the advantages of statements by applying our model to over 2700 tables from ESG reports. The homogeneous nature of statements permits exploratory data analysis on expansive information found in large collections of ESG reports.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=di7TFzAEYX	Lokesh Mishra, Sohayl Dhibi, Yusik Kim, Cesar Berrospi Ramis, Shubham Gupta, Michele Dolfi, Peter W.

Aligning Unstructured Paris Agreement Climate Plans with Sustainable Development Goals	Aligning unstructured climate policy documents according to a particular classification taxonomy with little to no labeled examples is challenging and requires manual effort of climate policy researchers. In this work we examine whether large language models (LLMs) can act as an effective substitute or assist in the annotation process. Utilizing a large set of text spans from Paris Agreement Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) linked to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets contained in the Climate Watch dataset from the World Resources Institute in combination with our own annotated data, we validate our approaches and establish a benchmark for model performance evaluation on this task. With our evaluation benchmarking we quantify the effectiveness of using zero-shot or few-shot prompted LLMs to align these documents.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=c4SgmVTbgD	Daniel Spokoyny, Janelle Cai, Tom Corringham, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick
Large Scale Narrative Messaging around Climate Change: A Cross-Cultural Comparison	"In this study, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 to extract and analyze the latent narrative messaging in climate change-related news articles from North American and Chinese media. By defining ""narrative messaging"" as the intrinsic moral or lesson of a story, we apply our model to a dataset of approximately 15,000 news articles in English and Mandarin, categorized by climate-related topics and ideological groupings. Our findings reveal distinct differences in the narrative values emphasized by different cultural and ideological contexts, with North American sources often focusing on individualistic and crisis-driven themes, while Chinese sources emphasize developmental and cooperative narratives. This work demonstrates the potential of LLMs in understanding and influencing climate communication, offering new insights into the collective belief systems that shape public discourse on climate change across different cultures."	https://openreview.net/forum?id=b5JqqSCUSB	Haiqi Zhou, David G Hobson, Derek Ruths, Andrew Piper
Unlearning Climate Misinformation in Large Language Models	Misinformation regarding climate change is a key roadblock in addressing one of the most serious threats to humanity. This paper investigates factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs) regarding climate information. Using true/false labeled Q\&A data for fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs on climate-related claims, we compare open-source models, assessing their ability to generate truthful responses to climate change questions. We investigate the detectability of models intentionally poisoned with false climate information, finding that such poisoning may not affect the accuracy of a model's responses in other domains. Furthermore, we compare the effectiveness of unlearning algorithms, fine-tuning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for factually grounding LLMs on climate change topics. Our evaluation reveals that unlearning algorithms can be effective for nuanced conceptual claims, despite previous findings suggesting their inefficacy in privacy contexts. These insights aim to guide the development of more factually reliable LLMs and highlight the need for additional work to secure LLMs against misinformation attacks.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=a2tGv7NaQ9	Michael Fore, Simranjit Singh, Chaehong Lee, Amritanshu Pandey, Antonios Anastasopoulos, Dimitrios Stamoulis
Assessing the Effectiveness of GPT-4o in Climate Change Evidence Synthesis and Systematic Assessments: Preliminary Insights	In this research short, we examine the potential of using GPT-4o, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) to undertake evidence synthesis and systematic assessment tasks. Traditional workflows for such tasks involve large groups of domain experts who manually review and synthesize vast amounts of literature. The exponential growth of scientific literature and recent advances in LLMs provide an opportunity to complementing these traditional workflows with new age tools. We assess the efficacy of GPT-4o to do these tasks on a sample from the dataset created by the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative (GAMI) where we check the accuracy of climate change adaptation related feature extraction from the scientific literature across three levels of expertise. Our results indicate that while GPT-4o can achieve high accuracy in low-expertise tasks like geographic location identification, their performance in intermediate and high-expertise tasks, such as stakeholder identification and assessment of depth of the adaptation response, is less reliable. The findings motivate the need for designing assessment workflows that utilize the strengths of models like GPT-4o while also providing refinements to improve their performance on these tasks.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=ZcMeHsJg3c	Elphin Tom Joe, Sai Koneru, Christine J Kirchhoff
CLIMATELI: Evaluating Entity Linking on Climate Change Data	Climate Change (CC) is a pressing topic of global importance, attracting increasing attention across research fields, from social sciences to Natural Language Processing (NLP). CC is also discussed in various settings and communication platforms, from academic publications to social media forums. Understanding who and what is mentioned in such data is a first critical step to gaining new insights into CC. We present CLIMATELI (CLIMATe Entity LInking), the first manually annotated CC dataset that links 3,087 entity spans to Wikipedia. Using CLIMATELI (CLIMATe Entity LInking), we evaluate existing entity linking (EL) systems on the CC topic across various genres and propose automated filtering methods for CC entities. We find that the performance of EL models notably lags behind humans at both token and entity levels. Testing within the scope of retaining or excluding non-nominal and/or non-CC entities particularly impacts the models' performances.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=TXmTYknzwk	Shijia Zhou, Siyao Peng, Barbara Plank
Evaluating ChatNetZero, an LLM-Chatbot to Demystify Climate Pledges	This paper introduces and evaluates ChatNetZero, a large-language model (LLM) chatbot developed through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which uses generative AI to produce answers grounded in verified, climate-domain specific information. We describe ChatNetZero's design, particularly the innovation of anti-hallucination and reference modules designed to enhance the accuracy and credibility of generated responses. To evaluate ChatNetZero's performance against other LLMs, including GPT-4, Gemini, Coral, and ChatClimate, we conduct two types of validation: comparing LLMs' generated responses to original source documents to verify their factual accuracy, and employing an expert survey to evaluate the overall quality, accuracy and relevance of each response. We find that while ChatNetZero responses show higher factual accuracy when compared to original source data, experts surveyed prefer lengthier responses that provide more context. Our results highlight the importance of prioritizing information presentation in the design of domain-specific LLMs to ensure that scientific information is effectively communicated, especially as even expert audiences find it challenging to assess the credibility of AI-generated content.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=MmTaM7lmvu	Angel Hsu, Mason Laney, James Zhang, Diego Manya, Linda Farczadi
Envisioning NLP for intercultural climate communication	Climate communication is often seen by the NLP community as an opportunity for machine translation, applied to ever smaller languages. However, over 90% the world's linguistic diversity comes from languages with `primary orality' and mostly spoken in non-Western oral societies. A case in point is the Aboriginal communities of Northern Australia, where we have been conducting workshops on climate communication, revealing shortcomings in existing communication practices along with new opportunities for improving intercultural communication. We present a case study of climate communication in an oral society, including the voices of many local people, and draw several lessons for the research program of NLP in the climate space.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=LIraXyxhYu	Steven Bird, Angelina Aquino, Ian Mongunu Gumbula
EnClaim: A Style Augmented Transformer Architecture for Environmental Claim Detection	Across countries, a noteworthy paradigm shift towards a more sustainable and environmentally responsible economy is underway. However, this positive transition is accompanied by an upsurge in greenwashing, where companies make exaggerated claims about their environmental commitments. To address this challenge and protect consumers, initiatives have emerged to substantiate green claims. With the proliferation of environmental and scientific assertions, a critical need arises for automated methods to detect and validate these claims at scale. In this paper, we introduce EnClaim, a transformer network architecture augmented with stylistic features for automatically detecting claims from open web documents or social media posts. The proposed model considers various linguistic stylistic features in conjunction with language models to predict whether a given statement constitutes a claim. We have rigorously evaluated the model using multiple open datasets. Our initial findings indicate that incorporating stylistic vectors alongside the BERT-based language model enhances the overall effectiveness of environmental claim detection.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=GtxF95xlZ1	Diya Saha, Manjira Sinha, Tirthankar Dasgupta
LEAF: Predicting the Environmental Impact of Food Products based on their Name	Although food consumption represents a sub- stantial global source of greenhouse gas emis- sions, assessing the environmental impact of off-the-shelf products remains challenging. Currently, this information is often unavailable, hindering informed consumer decisions when grocery shopping. The present work introduces a new set of models called LEAF, which stands for Linguistic Environmental Analysis of Food Products. LEAF models predict the life-cycle environmental impact of food products based on their name. It is shown that LEAF models can accurately predict the environmental im- pact based on just the product name in a multi- lingual setting, greatly outperforming zero-shot classification methods. Models of varying sizes and capabilities are released, along with the code and dataset to fully reproduce the study.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=EET32LtDv8	Bas Krahmer
Generative Debunking of Climate Misinformation	Misinformation about climate change causes numerous negative impacts, necessitating corrective responses. Psychological research has offered various strategies for reducing the influence of climate misinformation, such as the fact-myth-fallacy-fact-structure. However, practically implementing corrective interventions at scale represents a challenge. Automatic detection and correction of misinformation offers a solution to the misinformation problem. This study documents the development of large language models that accept as input a climate myth and produce a debunking that adheres to the fact-myth-fallacy-fact (``truth sandwich'') structure, by incorporating contrarian claim classification and fallacy detection into an LLM prompting framework. We combine open (Mixtral, Palm2) and proprietary (GPT-4) LLMs with prompting strategies of varying complexity. Experiments reveal promising performance of GPT-4 and Mixtral if combined with structured prompts. We identify specific challenges of debunking generation and human evaluation, and map out avenues for future work. We release a dataset of high-quality truth-sandwich debunkings, source code and a demo of the debunking system.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=7bvuSsdG9V	Francisco Zanartu, Yulia Otmakhova, John Cook, Lea Frermann
