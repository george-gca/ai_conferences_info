Saliency Diversified Deep Ensemble for Robustness to Adversaries	Deep learning models have shown incredible performance on numerous image recognition, classification, and reconstruction tasks. Although very appealing and valuable due to their predictive capabilities, one common threat remains challenging to resolve. A specifically trained attacker can introduce malicious input perturbations to fool the network, thus causing potentially harmful mispredictions. Moreover, these attacks can succeed when the adversary has full access to the target model (white-box) and even when such access is limited (black-box setting). The ensemble of models can protect against such attacks but might be brittle under shared vulnerabilities in its members (attack transferability). To that end, this work proposes a novel diversity-promoting learning approach for the deep ensembles. The idea is to promote saliency map diversity (SMD) on ensemble members to prevent the attacker from targeting all ensemble members at once by introducing an additional term in our learning objective. During training, this helps us minimize the alignment between model saliencies to reduce shared member vulnerabilities and, thus, increase ensemble robustness to adversaries. We empirically show a reduced transferability between ensemble members and improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art ensemble defense against medium and high-strength white-box attacks. In addition, we demonstrate that our approach combined with existing methods outperforms state-of-the-art ensemble algorithms for defense under white-box and black-box attacks.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=wGkmGrDsco8	Alex Bogun, Dimche Kostadinov, Damian Borth
Aliasing coincides with CNNs vulnerability towards adversarial attacks	Many commonly well-performing convolutional neural network models have shown to be susceptible to input data perturbations, indicating a low model robustness. Adversarial attacks are thereby specifically optimized to reveal model weaknesses, by generating small, barely perceivable image perturbations that flip the model prediction. Robustness against attacks can be gained for example by using adversarial examples during training, which effectively reduces the measurable model attackability. In contrast, research on analyzing the source of a model's vulnerability is scarce. In this paper, we analyze adversarially trained, robust models in the context of a specifically suspicious network operation, the downsampling layer, and provide evidence that robust models have learned to downsample more accurately and suffer significantly less from aliasing than baseline models.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=vKc1mLxBebP	Julia Grabinski, Janis Keuper, Margret Keuper
Robust No-Regret Learning in Min-Max Stackelberg Games	The behavior of no-regret learning algorithms is well understood in two-player min-max (i.e, zero-sum) games. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of no-regret learning in min-max games with dependent strategy sets, where the strategy of the first player constrains the behavior of the second. Such games are best understood as sequential, i.e., min-max Stackelberg, games. We consider two settings, one in which only the first player chooses their actions using a no-regret algorithm while the second player best responds, and one in which both players use no-regret algorithms. For the former case, we show that no-regret dynamics converge to a Stackelberg equilibrium. For the latter case, we introduce a new type of regret, which we call Lagrangian regret, and show that if both players minimize their Lagrangian regrets, then play converges to a Stackelberg equilibrium. We then observe that online mirror descent (OMD) dynamics in these two settings correspond respectively to a known nested (i.e., sequential) gradient descent-ascent (GDA) algorithm and a new simultaneous GDA-like algorithm, thereby establishing convergence of these algorithms to Stackelberg equilibrium. Finally, we analyze the robustness of OMD dynamics to perturbations by investigating dynamic min-max Stackelberg games. We prove that OMD dynamics are robust for a large class of dynamic min-max games with independent strategy sets. In the dependent case, we demonstrate the robustness of OMD dynamics experimentally by simulating them in dynamic Fisher markets, a canonical example of a min-max Stackelberg game with dependent strategy sets.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=u_lOumlm7mu	Denizalp Goktas, Jiayi Zhao, Amy Greenwald
Improving Perceptual Quality of Adversarial Images Using Perceptual Distance Minimization and Normalized Variance Weighting	Neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are obtained by adding intentionally crafted perturbations to original images. However, these perturbations degrade their perceptual quality and make them more difficult to perceive by humans. In this paper, we propose two separate attack agnostic methods to increase the perceptual quality, measured in terms of perceptual distance metric LPIPS, while preserving the target fooling rate. The first method intensifies the perturbations in the high variance areas in the images. This method could be used in both white-box and black-box settings for any type of adversarial examples with only the computational cost of calculating the pixel based image variance. The second method aims to minimize the perturbations of already generated adversarial examples independent of the attack type. In this method, the distance between benign and adversarial examples are reduced until adversarial examples reach the decision boundaries of the true class. We show that these methods could also be used in conjunction to improve the perceptual quality of adversarial examples and demonstrate the quantitative improvements on CIFAR-10 and NIPS2017 Adversarial Learning Challenge datasets.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=rq2hMS4OaUX	Berat Tuna KARLI, Deniz Sen, Alptekin Temizel
Demystifying the Adversarial Robustness of Random Transformation Defenses	Current machine learning models suffer from evasion attacks (i.e., adversarial examples) raising concerns in security-sensitive settings such as autonomous vehicles. While many countermeasures may look promising, only a few withstand rigorous evaluation. Recently, defenses using random transformations (RT) have shown impressive results, particularly BaRT (Raff et al. 2019) on ImageNet. However, this type of defense has not been rigorously evaluated, leaving its robustness properties poorly understood. The stochasticity of these models also makes evaluation more challenging and many proposed attacks on deterministic models inapplicable. First, we show that the BPDA attack (Athalye, Carlini, and Wagner 2018) used in BaRT's evaluation is ineffective and likely overestimates its robustness. We then attempt to construct the strongest possible RT defense through the informed selection of transformations and Bayesian optimization for tuning their parameters. Furthermore, we create the strongest possible attack to evaluate our RT defense. Our new attack vastly outperforms the baseline, reducing the accuracy by $83\%$ compared to the $19\%$ reduction by the commonly used EoT attack ($4.3\times$ improvement). Our result indicates that the RT defense on Imagenettedataset (a ten-class subset of ImageNet) is not robust against adversarial examples. Extending the study further, we use our new attack to adversarially train RT defense (called AdvRT). However, the attack is still not sufficiently strong, and thus, the AdvRT model is no more robust than its RT counterpart. In the process of formulating our defense and attack, we perform several ablation studies and uncover insights that we hope will broadly benefit scientific communities studying stochastic neural networks and their robustness properties	https://openreview.net/forum?id=p4SrFydwO5	Chawin Sitawarin, Zachary Golan-Strieb, David Wagner
Ensemble-in-One: Learning Ensemble within Random Gated Networks for Enhanced Adversarial Robustness	Adversarial attacks have threatened modern deep learning systems by crafting adversarial examples with small perturbations to fool the convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Ensemble training methods are promising to facilitate better adversarial robustness by diversifying the vulnerabilities among the sub-models, simultaneously maintaining comparable accuracy as standard training. Previous practices also demonstrate that enlarging the ensemble can improve the robustness. However, existing ensemble methods are with poor scalability, owing to the rapid complexity increase when including more sub-models in the ensemble. Moreover, it is usually infeasible to train or deploy an ensemble with substantial sub-models, owing to the tight hardware resource budget and latency requirement. In this work, we propose Ensemble-in-One (EIO), a simple but effective method to enlarge the ensemble within a random gated network (RGN). EIO augments the original model by replacing the parameterized layers with multi-path random gated blocks (RGBs) to construct an RGN. By diversifying the vulnerability of the numerous paths through the super-net, it provides high scalability because the paths within an RGN exponentially increase with the network depth. Our experiments demonstrate that EIO consistently outperforms previous ensemble training methods with even less computational overhead, simultaneously achieving better accuracy-robustness trade-offs than adversarial training.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=og7CXiEXqpZ	Yi Cai, Xuefei Ning, Yu Wang, Huazhong Yang
Mitigation of Adversarial Policy Imitation via Constrained Randomization of Policy (CRoP)	Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) policies are vulnerable to unauthorized replication attacks, where an adversary exploits imitation learning to reproduce target policies from observed behavior. In this paper, we propose Constrained Randomization of Policy (CRoP) as a mitigation technique against such attacks. CRoP induces the execution of sub-optimal actions at random under performance loss constraints. We present a parametric analysis of CRoP, address the optimality of CRoP, and establish theoretical bounds on the adversarial budget and the expectation of loss. Furthermore, we report the experimental evaluation of CRoP in Atari environments under adversarial imitation, which demonstrate the efficacy and feasibility of our proposed method against policy replication attacks.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=o_O7TOBC7jl	Nancirose G Piazza, Vahid Behzadan
An Adversarial Benchmark for Fake News Detection Models	"With the proliferation of online misinformation, fake news detection has gained importance in the artificial intelligence community. In this paper, we propose an adversarial benchmark that tests the ability of fake news detectors to reason about real-world facts. We formulate adversarial attacks that target three aspects of ""understanding"": compositional semantics, lexical relations, and sensitivity to modifiers. We test our benchmark using BERT classifiers fine-tuned on the LIAR and Kaggle Fake-News datasets, and show that both models fail to respond to changes in compositional and lexical meaning. Our results strengthen the need for such models to be used in conjunction with other fact checking methods."	https://openreview.net/forum?id=n3PMOhS42s6	Lorenzo Jaime Yu Flores, Yiding Hao
Training Universal Adversarial Perturbations with Alternating Loss Functions	Despite being very successful, deep learning models were shown to be vulnerable to crafted perturbations. Furthermore, changing the prediction of a network over any image by learning a single universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) was shown to be possible. In this work, we propose 3 different ways of training UAPs that can attain a predefined fooling rate, while, in association, optimizing $L_2$ or $L_\infty$ norms. To stabilize around a predefined fooling rate, we have integrated an alternating loss function scheme that changes the current loss function based on a given condition. In particular, the loss functions we propose are: Batch Alternating Loss, Epoch-Batch Alternating Loss and Progressive Alternating Loss. In addition, we empirically observed that UAPs that were learned by minimization attacks contain strong image-like features around the edges, hence we propose integrating a circular masking operation to the training to further alleviate visible perturbations. The proposed $L_2$ Progressive Alternating Loss method outperforms the popular attacks by providing a higher fooling rate at equal $L_2$ norms. Furthermore Filtered Progressive Alternating Loss can further reduce the $L_2$ norm by 33.3% at the same fooling rate. When optimized with regards to $L_\infty$, Progressive Alternating Loss manages to stabilize on the desired fooling rate of 95% with only 1 percentage point of deviation, despite $L_\infty$ norm being particularly sensitive to small updates.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=gVe36H8OrHW	Deniz Sen, Berat Tuna KARLI, Alptekin Temizel
Meta Adversarial Perturbations	A plethora of attack methods have been proposed to generate adversarial examples, among which the iterative methods have been demonstrated the ability to find a strong attack. However, the computation of an adversarial perturbation for a new data point requires solving a time-consuming optimization problem from scratch. To generate a stronger attack, it normally requires updating a data point with more iterations. In this paper, we show the existence of a \textit{meta adversarial perturbation} (MAP), a better initialization that causes natural images to be misclassified with high probability after being updated through only a one-step gradient ascent update, and propose an algorithm for computing such perturbations. We conduct extensive experiments, and the empirical results demonstrate that state-of-the-art deep neural networks are vulnerable to meta perturbations. We further show that these perturbations are not only image-agnostic, but also model-agnostic, as a single perturbation generalizes well across unseen data points and different neural network architectures.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=gP4WxGjNd3k	Chia-Hung Yuan, Pin-Yu Chen, Chia-Mu Yu
Metamorphic Adversarial Detection Pipeline for Face Recognition Systems	Adversarial examples pose a serious threat to the robustness of machine learning models in general and deep learning models in particular. Computer vision tasks like image classification, facial recognition, object detection, etc. and natural language processing tasks like sentiment analysis and semantic similarity assessment have all been proven vulnerable to adversarial attacks. For computer vision tasks specifically, these carefully crafted perturbations to input images can cause targeted misclassifications to a label of the attacker's choice, without the perturbations being detectable to the naked eye. A particular class of adversarial attacks called black box attacks can be used to fool a model under attack despite not having access to the model parameters or input datasets used to train the model. As part of the research presented in this paper, we first deploy a range of state of the art adversarial attacks against multiple face recognition pipelines trained in a black box setup, and then generate pair-wise adversarial image sets to deceive the corresponding models under attack. Consequently, we propose a novel approach for adversarial detection that utilizes statistical techniques to learn optimal thresholds of separation between clean and adversarial examples; achieving state of the art detection accuracies of over ~90%. Our proposed method has been exhaustively tested on multiple face recognition models under attack and adversarial attack type combinations with encouraging results.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=defs2E_Mrf0	Rohan Reddy Mekala, Sai Yerramreddy, Adam Porter
Is RobustBench/AutoAttack a suitable Benchmark for Adversarial Robustness?	Recently, RobustBench (Croce et al. 2020) has become a widely recognized benchmark for the adversarial robustness of image classification networks. In it's most commonly reported sub-task, RobustBench evaluates and ranks the adversarial robustness of trained neural networks on CIFAR10 under AutoAttack (Croce and Hein 2020b) with l∞ perturbations limited to ϵ = 8/255. With leading scores of the currently best performing models of around 60% of the baseline, it is fair to characterize this benchmark to be quite challenging. Despite it's general acceptance in recent literature, we aim to foster discussion about the suitability of RobustBench as a key indicator for robustness which could be generalized to practical applications. Our line of argumentation against this is two-fold and supported by excessive experiments presented in this paper: We argue that I) the alternation of data by AutoAttack with l∞, ϵ = 8/255 is unrealistically strong, resulting in close to perfect detection rates of adversarial samples even by simple detection algorithms and human observers. We also show that other attack methods are much harder to detect while achieving similar success rates. II) That results on low resolution data sets like CIFAR10 do not generalize well to higher resolution images as gradient based attacks appear to become even more detectable with increasing resolutions.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=aLB3FaqoMBs	Peter Lorenz, Dominik Strassel, Margret Keuper, Janis Keuper
The Diversity Metrics of Sub-models based on SVD of Jacobians for Ensembles Adversarial Robustness	Transferability of adversarial samples under different CNN models is not only one of the metrics indicators for evaluating the performance of adversarial examples, but also an important research direction in the defense of adversarial examples. Diversified models prevent black-box attacks relying on a specific alternative model. Meanwhile, recent research has revealed that adversarial transferability across sub-models may be used to abstractly express the diversity needs of sub-models under ensemble robustness. Because there was no mathematical description for this diversity in earlier studies, the difference in model architecture or model output was employed as an empirical standard in the assessment, with the model loss as the optimization aim. This paper proposes corresponding assessment criteria and provides a more accurate mathematical explanation of the transferability of adversarial samples between models based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) of data-dependent Jacobians. A new constraints norm is proposed in model training based on these criteria to isolate adversarial transferability without any prior knowledge of adversarial samples. Under the novel condition of high-dimensional inputs in training process, the model attribute extraction from dimensionality reduction of Jacobians makes evaluation metric and training norm more effective. Experiments have proved that the proposed metric is highly correlated with the actual robustness of transferability between sub-models and the model trained based on this constraint norm improve the adversarial robustness of ensemble.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=Z8lffFu2rTT	Ruoxi Qin, Linyuan Wang, Xuehui Du, Bin Yan, Xingyuan Chen
Patch Vestiges in the Adversarial Examples Against Vision Transformer Can Be Leveraged for Adversarial Detection	Vision Transformer (ViT), a Transformer-based architecture that divides images into patches, can catch up with or surpass convolution-based networks in multiple Computer Vision tasks. However, ViT is also vulnerable in the face of adversarial examples (AEs). Thus the topic around the attack and defense of ViT becomes very rewarding. Recent studies have found that the AEs against ViT seem to have grid-like textures that coincide with the patches. In this paper we confirm such sensation is true. We show that these grid-like textures are the remained vestiges due to the patch division from ViT. We name them as Patch Vestiges. We propose statistics to measure the sizes of Patch Vestiges in the images or AEs quantitatively. We also build a linear regression classifier to detect the AEs against ViT practically via the proposed statistics. The experiments show that the performance of the simple classifier can even match some recent adversarial detection methods, suggesting that when trying to attack ViT or detect the AEs against ViT, Patch Vestiges are worth considering about as a critical factor.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=Y3fjmc2vkKA	Juzheng Li
Robust Out-of-distribution Detection for Neural Networks	Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is critical for safely deploying deep learning models in the real world. Existing approaches for detecting OOD examples work well when evaluated on benign in-distribution and OOD samples. However, in this paper, we show that existing detection mechanisms can be extremely brittle when evaluating on in-distribution and OOD inputs with minimal adversarial perturbations which don't change their semantics. Formally, we extensively study the problem of Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection on common OOD detection approaches, and show that state-of-the-art OOD detectors can be easily fooled by adding small perturbations to the in-distribution and OOD inputs. To counteract these threats, we propose an effective algorithm called ALOE, which performs robust training by exposing the model to both adversarially crafted inlier and outlier examples. Our method can be flexibly combined with, and render existing methods robust. On common benchmark datasets, we show that ALOE substantially improves the robustness of state-of-the-art OOD detection, with 58.4% AUROC improvement on CIFAR-10 and 46.59% improvement on CIFAR-100.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=WMIoz7O_DPz	Jiefeng Chen, Yixuan Li, Xi Wu, Yingyu Liang, Somesh Jha
Revisiting Adversarial Robustness of Classifiers With a Reject Option	Adversarial training of deep neural networks (DNNs) is an important defense mechanism that allows a DNN to be robust to input perturbations, that can otherwise result in predictions errors. Recently, there is a growing interest in learning a classifier with a reject (abstain) option that can be more robust to adversarial perturbations by choosing to not return a prediction on inputs where the classifier may be incorrect. A challenge faced with robust learning of a classifier with reject option is that existing works do not have a mechanism to ensure that (very) small perturbations of the input are \textit{not} rejected, when they can in fact be accepted and correctly classified. We first propose a novel metric -- \textit{robust error with rejection} -- that extends the standard definition of robust error to include the rejection of small perturbations. The proposed metric has natural connections to the standard robust error (without rejection), as well as the robust error with rejection proposed in a recent work. Motivated by this metric, we propose novel loss functions and a robust training method -- \textit{stratified adversarial training with rejection} (SATR) -- for a classifier with reject option, where the goal is to accept and correctly-classify small input perturbations, while allowing the rejection of larger input perturbations that cannot be correctly classified. Experiments on well-known image classification DNNs using strong adaptive attack methods validate that SATR can significantly improve the robustness of a classifier with rejection compared to standard adversarial training (with confidence-based rejection) as well as a recently-proposed baseline.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=UiF3RTES7pU	Jiefeng Chen, Jayaram Raghuram, Jihye Choi, Xi Wu, Yingyu Liang, Somesh Jha
Estimating the Robustness of Classification Models by the Structure of the Learned Feature-Space	Over the last decade, the development of deep image classification networks has mostly been driven by the search for the best performance in terms of classification accuracy on standardized benchmarks like ImageNet. More recently, this focus has been expanded by the notion of model robustness, \ie the generalization abilities of models towards previously unseen changes in the data distribution. While new benchmarks, like ImageNet-C, have been introduced to measure robustness properties, we argue that fixed testsets are only able to capture a small portion of possible data variations and are thus limited and prone to generate new overfitted solutions. To overcome these drawbacks, we suggest to estimate the robustness of a model directly from the structure of its learned feature-space. We introduce robustness indicators which are obtained via unsupervised clustering of latent representations from a trained classifier and show very high correlations to the model performance on corrupted test data.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=UHBsuFPrJ11	Kalun Ho, Avraam Chatzimichailidis, Franz-Josef Pfreundt, Janis Keuper, Margret Keuper
Measuring the Contribution of Multiple Model Representations in Detecting Adversarial Instances	Deep learning models have been used for a wide variety of tasks. They are prevalent in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and other areas. While these models have worked well under many scenarios, it has been shown that they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This has led to a proliferation of research into ways that such attacks could be identified and/or defended against. Our goal is to explore the contribution that can be attributed to using multiple underlying models for the purpose of adversarial instance detection. Our paper describes two approaches that incorporate representations from multiple models for detecting adversarial examples. We devise controlled experiments for measuring the detection impact of incrementally utilizing additional models. For many of the scenarios we consider, the results show that performance increases with the number of underlying models used for extracting representations.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=LGlhzn1ZJl	Daniel Steinberg, Paul Munro
BiGrad: Differentiating through Bilevel Optimization Programming	Integrating mathematical programming, and in particular Bilevel Optimization Programming, within deep learning architectures has vast applications in various domains from machine learning to engineering. Bilevel programming is able to capture complex interactions when two actors have conflicting objectives. Previous approaches only consider single-level programming. In this paper, we thus propose Differentiating through Bilevel Optimization Programming (BiGrad) as approach for end-to-end learning of models that use Bilevel Programming as a layer. BiGrad has wide applicability and it can be used in modern machine learning frameworks. We focus on two classes of Bilevel Programming: continuous and combinatorial optimization problems. The framework extends existing approaches of single level optimization programming. We describe a class of gradient estimators for the combinatorial case which reduces the requirements in term of computation complexity; for the continuous variables case the gradient computation takes advantage of push-back approach (i.e. vector-jacobian product) for an efficient implementation. Experiments suggest that the proposed approach successfully extends existing single level approaches to Bilevel Programming.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=HvRAM-dpmEv	Francesco Alesiani
Optimal Robust Classification Trees	In many high-stakes domains, the data used to drive machine learning algorithms is noisy (due to e.g., the sensitive nature of the data being collected, limited resources available to validate the data, etc). This may cause a distribution shift to occur, where the distribution of the training data does not match the distribution of the testing data. In the presence of distribution shifts, any trained model can perform poorly in the testing phase. In this paper, motivated by the need for interpretability and robustness, we propose a mixed-integer optimization formulation and a tailored solution algorithm for learning optimal classification trees that are robust to adversarial perturbations in the data features. We evaluate the performance of our approach on numerous publicly available datasets, and compare the performance to a regularized, non-robust optimal tree. We show an increase of up to 14.16 percent in worst-case accuracy and increase of up to 4.72 percent in average-case accuracy across several data sets and distribution shifts from using our robust solution in comparison to the non-robust solution.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=HbasA9ysA3	Nathan Justin, Sina Aghaei, Andres Gomez, Phebe Vayanos
Detecting Adversaries, yet Faltering to Noise? Leveraging Conditional Variational AutoEncoders for Adversary Detection in the Presence of Noisy Images	With the rapid advancement and increased use of deep learning models in image identification, security becomes a major concern to their deployment in safety-critical systems. Since the accuracy and robustness of deep learning models are primarily attributed from the purity of the training samples, therefore the deep learning architectures are often susceptible to adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks are often obtained by making subtle perturbations to normal images, which are mostly imperceptible to humans, but can seriously confuse the state-of-the-art machine learning models. What is so special in the slightest intelligent perturbations or noise additions over normal images that it leads to catastrophic classifications by the deep neural networks? Using statistical hypothesis testing, we find that Conditional Variational AutoEncoders (CVAE) are surprisingly good at detecting imperceptible image perturbations. In this paper, we show how CVAEs can be effectively used to detect adversarial attacks on image classification networks. We demonstrate our results over MNIST, CIFAR-10 dataset and show how our method gives comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods in detecting adversaries while not getting confused with noisy images, where most of the existing methods falter.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=Ex1yemaQgU	Dvij Rajesh Kalaria, Aritra Hazra, Partha Pratim Chakrabarti
Broad Adversarial Training with Data Augmentation in the Output Space	In image classification, data augmentation and the usage of additional data has been shown to increase the efficiency of clean training and the accuracy of the resulting model. However, this does not prevent models from being fooled by adversarial manipulations. To increase the robustness, Adversarial Training (AT) is an easy, yet effective and widely used method to harden neural networks against adversarial inputs. Still, AT is computationally expensive and only creates one adversarial input per sample of the current batch. We propose Broad Adversarial Training (B-AT), which combines adversarial training and data augmentation in the decision space, i.e., on the models output vector. By adding random noise to the original adversarial output vector, we create multiple pseudo adversarial instances, thus increasing the data pool for adversarial training. We show that this general idea is applicable to two different learning paradigms, i.e., supervised and self-supervised learning. Using B-AT instead of AT for supervised learning, we can increase the robustness by 0.56\% for small seen attacks. For medium and larger seen attacks, the robustness increases by 4.57\% and 1.11\%, respectively. On large unseen attack, we can also report an increase in the robustness by 1.11\% and 0.29\%. When combining a larger corpus of input data with our proposed method, we report a slight increase of the clean accuracy and increased robustness against all observed attacks, compared to AT. In self-supervised training, we monitor a similar increase in robust accuracy for seen attacks and large unseen attacks, when it comes to the downstream task of image classification. In addition, for both observed self-supervised models, the clean accuracy also increases by up to 1.37\% using our method.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=EfhpoMWSqUN	Nils Worzyk, Stella Yu
Traversing the Local Polytopes of ReLU Neural Networks	Although neural networks (NNs) with ReLU activation functions have found success in a wide range of applications, their adoption in risk-sensitive settings has been limited by the concerns on robustness and interpretability. Previous works to examine robustness and to improve interpretability partially exploited the piecewise linear function form of ReLU NNs. In this paper, we explore the unique topological structure that ReLU NNs create in the input space, identifying the adjacency among the partitioned local polytopes and developing a traversing algorithm based on this adjacency. Our polytope traversing algorithm can be adapted to a wide range of applications related to robustness and interpretability. As the traversing algorithm explicitly visits all local polytopes, it returns a clear and full picture of the network behavior within the traversed region. The time and space complexity of the traversing algorithm is determined by the number of a ReLU NN's partitioning hyperplanes passing through the traversing region.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=EQjwT2-Vaba	Shaojie Xu, Joel Vaughan, Jie Chen, Aijun Zhang, Agus Sudjianto
A Practical and Stealthy Adversarial Attack for Cyber-Physical Applications	Adversarial perturbations on misleading a well-trained machine learning (ML) model have been studied in computer vision (CV) and other related application areas. However, there is very limited focus on studying the impact of adversarial perturbations on ML models used in data-driven cyber-physical systems (CPSs) that normally have complex physical and mechanical constraints. Because of the complex physical and mechanical constraints, called domain-knowledge constraints in our paper, established gradient-based adversarial attack methods are not always practical in CPS applications. In this paper, we propose an innovative CPS-specific adversarial attack method that is able to practically compromise the ML-based decision makings of CPSs while maintaining stealthy by meeting the complex domain-knowledge constraints. In the section of performance evaluations, different scenarios are considered to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed adversarial attack method in achieving a high success rate as well as sufficient stealthiness in CPS applications.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=Dp5B1YhYlwY	Yifu Wu, Jin Wei-Kocsis
Provable Defense Against Clustering Attacks on 3D Point Clouds	Lately, the literature on adversarial robustness spans from images to other domains such as point clouds. In this work, we consider clustering attacks on 3D point clouds and devise a provable defense mechanism to counter them. Specifically, we adopt a randomized smoothing strategy for 3D point clouds and derive a robustness certificate based on the cluster radius rather than the number of adversarial points. Our experiments on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets using the PointNet classifier demonstrate the effectiveness of our defense mechanism against targeted and untargeted clustering attacks with a large number of adversarial points.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=6gEDBV8g-Q	Dishanika Dewani Denipitiyage, Thalaiyasingam Ajanthan, Parameswaran Kamalaruban, Adrian Weller
Attention for Adversarial Attacks: Learning from your Mistakes	In order to apply Neural Networks in safety-critical settings, such as healthcare or autonomous driving, we need to be able to analyse their robustness against adversarial attacks. As complete verification is often computationally prohibitive, we rely on cheap and effective adversarial attacks to estimate their robustness. However, state-of-the-art adversarial attacks, such as the frequently used PGD attack, often require many random restarts to generate adversarial examples. Each time we perform a restart we ignore all previous unsuccessful runs. In order to alleviate this inefficiency, we propose a method that learns from its mistakes. Specifically, our method uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as an attention mechanism, to greatly reduce the search space for the attacks. The architecture of the GNN is based on the neural network we are attacking, and we perform forward and backward passes though the GNN mimicking the back-propagation algorithm of PGD attacks. The GNN outputs a smaller subspace for the PGD attack to focus on. Using our method, we manage to boost the attacks' performance: the GNN increases the success rate of PGD by over 35\% on a recent published dataset used for comparing adversarial attacks, while simultaneously reducing its average computation time.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=1o5Bzo7BO3v	Florian Jaeckle, Aleksandr Agadzhanov, JINGYUE LU, M.

Heterogeneous Architecture Search Approach within Adversarial Dynamic Defense Framework	Recent advances in adversarial attacks uncover the intrinsic vulnerability of modern deep neural networks (DNNs). To address this issue, various methods have been proposed to design network architectures that are robust to one particular type of adversarial attack. Recent research leverages the concept of dynamic defense framework (DDF) based on stochastic ensemble model for boosting the robustness of a DNN ensemble against such adversarial attacks. There is a need to enhance the diversity and gradient variations of the ensemble but stuck with the lack of efficient networks. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous architecture searching method based on NAS. Our method encourages heterogeneous networks, such that networks further improve diversity for ensemble, and thus, boost the adversarial robustness of DDF. Experimental results suggest that the diversity existing among the family of heterogeneous networks does restrain the transferability of the adversarial sample, and achieve superior performance when evaluating the robustness on the ASR-vs-distortion benchmark in different attack environments.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=1RALS1IpSh8	Qi Peng, Ruoxi Qin, Wenlin Liu, Libin Hou, Bin Yan, Linyuan Wang
Tensor Normalization and Full Distribution Training	In this work, we introduce pixel wise tensor normalization, which is inserted after rectifier linear units and, together with batch normalization, provides a significant improvement in the accuracy of modern deep neural networks. In addition, this work deals with the robustness of networks.We show that the factorized superposition of images from the training set and the reformulation of the multi class problem into a multilabel problem yields significantly more robust networks. The reformulation and the adjustment of the multi class log loss also improves the results compared to the overlay with only one class as label.

Would I regret later joining this Community ? Using temporal neighborhood information for community retention in a game theoretic community detection framework	Detection of relevant and meaningful communities from any social network is always a constant research challenge. Considering large social networks existing approaches often fail to capture perfect community partition or fail to converge fast. Inspired by nonmyopic reinforcement learning domain, in this paper, we have proposed a novel game theory based community detection algorithm which considers community retention based on temporal information as part of a node's strategy (i.e. for a node whether their current assigned community is more profitable based upon future possibilities, or should they switch at the moment), thereby minimizing cross-community false node switches. The proposed method has the following properties (a) considers community retention for a node in the network when it considers switching to another community, (b) achieves significantly better/comparable performance w.r.t baselines in terms of metrics such as quality of partition on various real world datasets,(c) faster convergence w.r.t traditional game theoretic approach which only considers short-term utility by minimizing cross-community node switches (d) utility to interpret at each iteration for any particular node's strategy.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=xUBHq0OrgeR	Prateek Chanda, Susanta Chakraborty
Learning to Schedule Heuristics for the Simultaneous Stochastic Optimization of Mining Complexes	The simultaneous stochastic optimization of mining complexes (SSOMC) is a large-scale combinatorial optimization problem that manages the extraction of materials from multiple mines and their processing using interconnected facilities. Following the work of Zarpellon et al. (2020) and Chmiela et al. (2021), to the best of our knowledge, this work proposes the first data-driven framework for heuristic scheduling in a hyper-heuristic-based solver that is fully self-managed to solve the SSOMC. The proposed learn-to-perturb (L2P) hyper-heuristic is a multi-neighborhood simulated annealing algorithm. The L2P selects the heuristic (perturbation) to apply in a self-adaptive manner using reinforcement learning (RL) to efficiently explore which local search is best suited for a particular search point. Several state-of-the-art agents have been incorporated into the proposed hyper-heuristic to better adapt the search and guide it towards better solutions. By learning from data describing the performance of heuristics, a problem-specific ordering of heuristics that collectively finds better solutions faster is obtained. The L2P is tested on several real-world mining complexes, with an emphasis on efficiency, robustness, and generalization capacity. Results show a reduction in the computational time by 30-45%.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=t650Q6l6DGn	Yassine Yaakoubi, Roussos Dimitrakopoulos
Neural Column Generation for Capacitated Vehicle Routing	The column generation technique is essential for solving linear programs with an exponential number of variables. Many important applications such as the vehicle routing problem (VRP) now require it. However, in practice, getting column generation to converge is challenging. It often ends up adding too many columns. In this work, we frame the problem of selecting which columns to add as one of sequential decision-making. We propose a neural column generation architecture that iteratively selects columns to be added to the problem. The architecture, inspired by stabilization techniques, first predicts the optimal duals. These predictions are then used to obtain the columns to add. We show using VRP instances that in this setting several machine learning models yield good performance on the task and that our proposed architecture learned using imitation learning outperforms a modern stabilization technique.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=k5sdO59Pw_3	Behrouz Babaki, Sanjay Dominik Jena, Laurent Charlin
Towards Supervised Learning of Optimal Replenishment Policies	We propose a supervised learning algorithm for the multi-period inventory problem (MPIP) that tackles shortcomings of existing multi-step, model-based methods on the one and policy-free reinforcement learning algorithms on the other hand. As a model-free end-to-end (E2E) method that takes advantage of auxiliary data, it avoids pitfalls like model misspecification, multi-step error accumulation and computational complexity induced by a repeated optimization step. Furthermore, it manages to leverage domain knowledge about the optimal solution structure. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first supervised learning approaches to solve the MPIP and the first one to learn policy parameters. Given the variety of settings in which OR researchers have developed well-performing policies, our approach can serve as a blueprint of how to design E2E methods that leverage that knowledge. We validate our hypotheses on synthetic data and demonstrate the effect of individual model characteristics.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=iclZLe0BzSV	Alexander Beier, Moritz Fleischmann, Heiner Stuckenschmidt
Application of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Battery Management in Renewable Mini-Grids	Electricity is an integral part of modern society, yet globally millions of people are without access. This lack of access, coupled with increasing concern over climate change represents a serious global challenge. Distributed energy storage will likely play a large part in the future of the grid, however, battery management remains an open problem. In this work, we re-frame the battery management problem in an Operations Research (OR) context as a multi-agent newsvendor problem. We benchmark seven Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms and compare their performance with five popular handcrafted heuristic strategies. We considered MARL algorithms due to their capacity to learn novel policies from data that may outperform handcrafted rule-based policies, especially as problem complexity increases. We find that all seven methods learn policies that achieve comparable results to each other and outperform a simple keep-fully-charged heuristic consistently. However, they do not consistently outperform all the heuristics considered in all the scenarios considered.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=hkEIoSdkQc	Tomisin I.

SatNet: A Benchmark for Satellite Scheduling Optimization	Satellites provide essential services such as networking and weather tracking, and the number of satellites are expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. Communications with terrestrial ground stations is one of the critical functionalities of any space mission. Satellite scheduling is a problem that has been scientifically investigated since the 1970s. A central aspect of this problem is the need to consider bandwidth resource contention and satellite visibility constraints as they require line of sight. Due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, prior solutions such as linear programs and evolutionary algorithms require extensive compute capabilities to output a feasible schedule for each scenario. Machine learning based scheduling can provide an alternative solution by training a model with historical data and generating a schedule quickly with model inference. We present SatNet, a benchmark for satellite scheduling optimization based on historical data from the NASA Deep Space Network. We propose formulation of the satellite scheduling problem as a Markov Decision Process and use reinforcement learning (RL) policies to generate schedules. The nature of constraints imposed by SatNet differ from other combinatorial optimization problems such as vehicle routing studied in prior literature. Our initial results indicate that RL is an alternative optimization approach that can generate candidate solutions of comparable quality to existing state-of-the-practice results. However, we also find that RL policies overfit to the training dataset and do not generalize well to new data, thereby necessitating continued research on reusable and generalizable agents.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=buIUxK7F-Bx	Edwin Goh, Hamsa Shwetha Venkataram, Bharathan Balaji, Brian D.

Machine Learning Based Aircraft Recovery Optimization	In this research, supervised machine learning is employed to expedite optimization. The core idea is to try to identify components of optimal solutions to new problem instances by leveraging their similarity with alternative (historical) problem instances presented in the offline model-training phase.

Crew Recovery Using Machine Learning and Optimization	Due to the irregular nature of flight operations, airlines need to take a range of actions to recover their aircraft and crew schedules. The limited time frames prevent airlines from using a full-scale optimization approach. Consequently, airlines typically apply recovery solutions that can be far from optimal. This study proposes a practical method that combines machine learning and optimization to find improved recovery solutions. Our procedure is based on the idea that the most effective constraints to add to the recovery models without sacrificing the solution quality, can be determined in advance by leveraging the similarities between disruptions. Our experiments show that this approach can reduce solution time significantly while still achieving high-quality solutions.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=Qqs6_B35sF5	AHMET ESAT HIZIR, Cynthia Barnhart, Vikrant Vaze
Multicrew Scheduling and Routing in Road Network Restoration Based on Deep Q-learning	Road network restoration is an important issue in the post-disaster disposal and rescue, especially when extraor-dinarily serious natural disasters (e.g., floods and earth-quakes) occur. Central to this endeavor is the problem of determining how to reasonably schedule and route the re-pair crew to quickly restore the damaged road network and establish reliable supply lines from supply nodes to demand nodes. However, most existing work focuses on the activities of the single repair crew, and rarely consid-ers the problem of continuously damaged road sections, especially for the road network with enormous demand nodes and serious damage. Consequently, this work is concentrated on multicrew scheduling and routing for the damaged road network with enormous demand nodes. Specifically, a model of multicrew scheduling and routing is first presented. Next, a road network partition strategy is first proposed to make different repair crews responsible for different subnets. Then, a deep Q-learning based mul-ticrew scheduling and routing algorithm is proposed for the damaged road network with enormous demand nodes, which utilizes the learning experience of multiple repair crews to achieve hybrid learning. Finally, experimental re-sults demonstrate that the proposed method can make re-pair crews adjust their scheduling and routing strategies according to the damaged road network and provides a useful attempt to restore the damaged road network in complex emergency scenarios of post-disaster.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=QAKb7o4IAEQ	Pin Zhao Su, Lianqi DUAN, Guofu ZHANG, Jiayuan CHANG, Yufeng SHEN
Reversible Action Design for Combinatorial Optimization with ReinforcementLearning	Combinatorial optimization problem (COP) over graphs is a fundamental challenge in optimization. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a new framework to tackle these problems and has demonstrated promising results. However, most RL solutions employ a greedy manner to construct the solution incrementally, thus inevitably pose unnecessary dependency on action sequences and need a lot of problem-specific designs. We propose a general RL framework that not only exhibits state-of-the-art empirical performance but also generalizes to a variety class of COPs. Specifically, we define state as a solution to a problem instance and action as a perturbation to this solution. We utilize graph neural networks (GNN) to extract latent representations for given problem instances for state-action encoding, and then apply deep Q-learning to obtain a policy that gradually refines the solution by flipping or swapping vertex labels. Experiments are conducted on Maximum $k$-Cut and Traveling Salesman Problem and performance improvement is achieved against a set of learning-based and heuristic baselines.	https://openreview.net/forum?id=JHbybZxzZq0	Fan Yao, Renqin Cai, Hongning Wang
