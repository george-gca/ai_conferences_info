Swift Logic for Big Data and Knowledge Graphs	Many modern companies wish to maintain knowledge in the form of a corporate knowledge graph and to use and manage this knowledge via a knowledge graph management system (KGMS). We formulate various requirements for a fully fledged KGMS. In particular, such a system must be capable of performing complex reasoning tasks but, at the same time, achieve efficient and scalable reasoning over Big Data with an acceptable computational complexity. Moreover, a KGMS needs interfaces to corporate databases, the web, and machine-learning and analytics packages. We present KRR formalisms and a system achieving these goals.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/1	Luigi Bellomarini, Georg Gottlob, Andreas Pieris, Emanuel Sallinger
Computing Bayes-Nash Equilibria in Combinatorial Auctions with Continuous Value and Action Spaces	Combinatorial auctions (CAs) are widely used in practice, which is why understanding their incentive properties is an important problem. However, finding Bayes-Nash equilibria (BNEs) of CAs analytically is tedious, and prior algorithmic work has only considered limited solution concepts (e.g. restricted action spaces). In this paper, we present a fast, general algorithm for computing symmetric pure ε-BNEs in CAs with continuous values and actions. In contrast to prior work, we separate the search phase (for finding the BNE) from the verification step (for estimating the ε), and always consider the full (continuous) action space in the best response computation. We evaluate our method in the well-studied LLG domain, against a benchmark of 16 CAs for which analytical BNEs are known. In all cases, our algorithm converges quickly, matching the known results with high precision. Furthermore, for CAs with quasi-linear utility functions and independently distributed valuations, we derive a theoretical bound on ε. Finally, we introduce the new Multi-Minded LLLLGG domain with eight goods and six bidders, and apply our algorithm to finding an equilibrium in this domain. Our algorithm is the first to find an accurate BNE in a CA of this size.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/18	Vitor Bosshard, Benedikt Bünz, Benjamin Lubin, Sven Seuken
Aggressive, Tense or Shy? Identifying Personality Traits from Crowd Videos	We present a real-time algorithm to automatically classify the behavior or personality of a pedestrian based on his or her movements in a crowd video. Our classification criterion is based on Personality Trait theory. We present a statistical scheme that dynamically learns the behavior of every pedestrian and computes its motion model. This model is combined with global crowd characteristics to compute the movement patterns and motion dynamics and use them for crowd prediction. Our learning scheme is general and we highlight its performance in identifying the personality of different pedestrians in low and high density crowd videos. We also evaluate the accuracy by comparing the results with a user study.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/17	Aniket Bera, Tanmay Randhavane, Dinesh Manocha
Equilibria in Ordinal Games: A Framework based on Possibility Theory.	The present paper proposes the first definition of mixed equilibrium for ordinal games. This definition naturally extends possibilistic (single agent) decision theory. This allows us to provide a unifying view of single and multi-agent qualitative decision theory. Our first contribution is to show that ordinal games always admit a possibilistic mixed equilibrium, which can be seen as a qualitative counterpart to mixed (probabilistic) equilibrium.Then, we show that a possibilistic mixed equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time (wrt the size of the game), which contrasts with pure Nash or mixed probabilistic equilibrium computation in cardinal game theory.The definition we propose is thus operational in two ways: (i) it tackles the case when no pure Nash equilibrium exists in an ordinal game; and (ii) it allows an efficient computation of a mixed equilibrium.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/16	Nahla Ben Amor, Helene Fargier, Régis Sabbadin
Parameterised Verification of Data-aware Multi-Agent Systems	We introduce parameterised data-aware multi-agent systems, a formalism to reason about the temporal-epistemic properties of arbitrarily large collections of homogeneous agents, each operating on an infinite data domain. We show that their parameterised verification problem is semi-decidable for classes of interest. This is demonstrated by separately addressing the unboundedness of the number of agents and the the data domain. In doing so we reduce the parameterised model checking problem for these systems to that of parameterised verification for interleaved interpreted systems. We illustrate the expressivity of the formal model by modelling English auctions with an unbounded number of bidders on unbouded data and show how the technique here introduced can be used to give formal guarantees on the resulting system behaviour.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/15	Francesco Belardinelli, Panagiotis Kouvaros, Alessio Lomuscio
Verification of Broadcasting Multi-Agent Systems against an Epistemic Strategy Logic	We study a class of synchronous, perfect-recall multi-agent systemswith imperfect information and broadcasting (i.e., fully observableactions). We define an epistemic extension of strategy logic withincomplete information and the assumption of uniform and coherentstrategies. In this setting, we prove that the model checking problem,and thus rational synthesis, is decidable with non-elementarycomplexity. We exemplify the applicability of the framework on arational secret-sharing scenario.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/14	Francesco Belardinelli, Alessio Lomuscio, Aniello Murano, Sasha Rubin
The Condorcet Principle for Multiwinner Elections: From Shortlisting to Proportionality	We study two notions of stability in multiwinner elections that are based on the Condorcet criterion. The first notion was introduced by Gehrlein and is majoritarian in spirit. The second one, local stability, is introduced in this paper, and focuses on voter representation. The goal of this paper is to explore these two notions, their implications on restricted domains, and the computational complexity of rules that are consistent with them.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/13	Haris Aziz, Edith Elkind, Piotr Faliszewski, Martin Lackner, Piotr Skowron
Pareto Optimal Allocation under Uncertain Preferences	The assignment problem is one of the most well-studied settings in social choice, matching, and discrete allocation. We consider this problem with the additional feature that agents' preferences involve uncertainty. The setting with uncertainty leads to a number of interesting questions including the following ones. How to compute an assignment with the highest probability of being Pareto optimal? What is the complexity of computing the probability that a given assignment is Pareto optimal? Does there exist an assignment that is Pareto optimal with probability one? We consider these problems under two natural uncertainty models: (1) the lottery model in which each agent has an independent probability distribution over linear orders and (2) the joint probability model that involves a joint probability distribution over preference profiles. For both of these models, we present a number of algorithmic and complexity results highlighting the difference and similarities in the complexity of the two models.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/12	Haris Aziz, Ronald de Haan, Baharak  Rastegari
An Abstraction-Refinement Methodology for Reasoning about Network Games	Network games (NGs) are played on directed graphs and are extensively used in network design and analysis. Search problems for NGs include finding special strategy profiles such as a Nash equilibrium and a globally optimal solution. The networks modeled by NGs may be huge. In formal verification, abstraction has proven to be an extremely effective technique for reasoning about systems with big and even infinite state spaces. We describe an abstraction-refinement methodology for reasoning about NGs. Our methodology is based on an abstraction function that maps the state space of an NG to a much smaller state space. We search for a global optimum and a Nash equilibrium by reasoning on an under- and an over-approximation defined on top of this smaller state space. When the approximations are too coarse to find such profiles, we refine the abstraction function. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the methodology.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/11	Guy Avni, Shibashis Guha, Orna Kupferman
Measuring the Intensity of Attacks in Argumentation Graphs with Shapley Value	In an argumentation setting, a semantics evaluates the overall acceptability of arguments. Consequently, it reveals the global loss incurred by each argument due to attacks. However, it does not say anything on the contribution of each attack to that loss. This paper introduces the novel concept of contribution measure which evaluates those contributions. It starts by defining a set of axioms that a reasonable measure would satisfy, then shows that the Shapley value is the unique measure that satisfies them. Finally, it investigates the properties of the latter under existing semantics.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/10	Leila Amgoud, Jonathan Ben-Naim, Srdjan Vesic
Acceptability Semantics for Weighted Argumentation Frameworks	The paper studies semantics that evaluate arguments in argumentation graphs, where each argument has a basic strength, and may be attacked by other arguments. It starts by defining a set of principles, each of which is a property that a semantics could satisfy. It provides the first formal analysis and comparison of existing semantics. Finally, it defines three novel semantics that satisfy more principles than existing ones.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/9	Leila Amgoud, Jonathan Ben-Naim, Dragan Doder, Srdjan Vesic
Efficient Computation of Extensions for Dynamic Abstract Argumentation Frameworks: An Incremental Approach	Abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs) are a well-known formalism for modelling and deciding many argumentation problems. Computational issues and evaluation algorithms have been deeply investigated for static AFs, whose structure does not change over the time. However, AFs are often dynamic as a consequence of the fact that argumentation is inherently dynamic. In this paper, we tackle the problem of incrementally computing extensions for dynamic AFs: given an initial extension and an update (or a set of updates), we devise a technique for computing an extension of the updated AF under four well-known semantics (i.e., complete, preferred, stable, and grounded). The idea is to identify a reduced (updated) AF sufficient to compute an extension of the whole AF and use state-of-the-art algorithms to recompute an extension of the reduced AF only. The experiments reveal that, for all semantics considered and using different solvers, the incremental technique is on average two orders of magnitude faster than computing the semantics from scratch.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/8	Gianvincenzo Alfano, Sergio Greco, Francesco Parisi
Pure Nash Equilibria in Online Fair Division	We consider a fair division setting in which items arrive one by one and are allocated to agents via two existing mechanisms: LIKE and BALANCED LIKE. The LIKE mechanism is strategy-proof whereas the BALANCED LIKE mechanism is not. Whilst LIKE is strategy-proof, we show that it is not group strategy-proof. Indeed, our first main result is that no online mechanism is group strategy-proof. We then focus on pure Nash equilibria of these two mechanisms. Our second main result is that computing a pure Nash equilibrium is tractable for LIKE and intractable for BALANCED LIKE. Our third main result is that there could be multiple such profiles and counting them is also intractable even when we restrict our attention to equilibria with a specific property (e.g. envy-freeness, Pareto efficiency).	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/7	Martin Aleksandrov, Toby Walsh
Diverse Weighted Bipartite b-Matching	Bipartite matching, where agents on one side of a market are matched to agents or items on the other, is a classical problem in computer science and economics, with widespread application in healthcare, education, advertising, and general resource allocation. A practitioner's goal is typically to maximize a matching market's economic efficiency, possibly subject to some fairness requirements that promote equal access to resources. A natural balancing act exists between fairness and efficiency in matching markets, and has been the subject of much research.In this paper, we study a complementary goal---balancing diversity and efficiency---in a generalization of bipartite matching where agents on one side of the market can be matched to sets of agents on the other. Adapting a classical definition of the diversity of a set, we propose a quadratic programming-based approach to solving a submodular minimization problem that balances diversity and total weight of the solution. We also provide a scalable greedy algorithm with theoretical performance bounds. We then define the price of diversity, a measure of the efficiency loss due to enforcing diversity, and give a worst-case theoretical bound. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our methods on three real-world datasets, and show that the price of diversity is not bad in practice. Our code is publicly accessible for further research.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/6	Faez Ahmed, John P. Dickerson, Mark Fuge
Proactive and Reactive Coordination of Non-dedicated Agent Teams Operating in Uncertain Environments	Domains such as disaster rescue, security patrolling etc. often feature dynamic environments where allocations of tasks to agents become ineffective due to unforeseen conditions that may require agents to leave the team. Agents leave the team either due to arrival of high priority tasks (e.g., emergency, accident or violation) or due to some damage to the agent. Existing research in task allocation has only considered fixed number of agents and in some instances arrival of new agents on the team. However, there is little or no literature that considers situations where agents leave the team after task allocation. To that end, we first provide a general model to represent non-dedicated teams. Second, we provide a proactive approach based on sample average approximation to generate a strategy that works well across different feasible scenarios of agents leaving the team. Furthermore, we also provide a 2-stage approach that provides a 2-stage policy that changes allocation based on observed state of the team. Third, we provide a reactive approach that rearranges the allocated tasks to better adapt to leaving agents. Finally, we provide a detailed evaluation of our approaches on existing benchmark problems.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/5	Pritee Agrawal, Pradeep Varakantham
Super-Human AI for Strategic Reasoning: Beating Top Pros in Heads-Up No-Limit Texas Hold'em	Poker has been a challenge problem in AI and game theory for decades. As a game of imperfect information it involves obstacles not present in games like chess and Go, and requires totally different techniques. No program had been able to beat top players in large poker games. Until now! In January 2017, our AI, Libratus, beat a team of four top specialist professionals in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em, which has 10^161 decision points. This game is the main benchmark challenge for imperfect-information game solving. Libratus is the only AI that has beat top humans at this game. Libratus is powered by new algorithms in each of its three main modules: 1. computing blueprint (approximate Nash equilibrium) strategies before the event, 2. novel nested endgame solving during play, and 3. fixing its own strategy to play even closer to equilibrium based on what holes the opponents have been able to identify and exploit. These domain-independent algorithms have potential applicability to a variety of real-world imperfect-information games such as negotiation, business strategy, cybersecurity, physical security, military applications, strategic pricing, product portfolio planning, certain areas of finance, auctions, political campaigns, and steering biological adaptation and evolution, for example, for medical treatment planning.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/4	Tuomas Sandholm
Become Popular in SNS: Tag Recommendation using FolkPopularityRank to Enhance Social Popularity	In this demo, we address two emerging yet challenging problems in social media: (1) scoring the text tags in terms of the influence to the numbers of views, comments, and favorite ratings of images and videos on content sharing services, and (2) recommending additional tags to increase such popularity-related numbers. For these purposes, we present a demo using our FolkPopularityRank (FP-Rank) algorithm, which can score and recommend text tags based on their ability to influence the popularity-related numbers. Our experiments using 1,000 photos showed that we can achieve 1.6 times more views than the original tag sets in Flickr just by adding tags recommended by FP-Rank.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/781	Toshihiko Yamasaki, Yiwei Zhang, Jiani Hu, Shumpei Sano, Kiyoharu Aizawa
Emergency Evacuation Simulator (EES) - a Tool for Planning Community Evacuations in Australia	This work addresses the problem of encoding cognitive agents that are capable of complex reasoning beyond simple rules, within agent-based models (ABM). This is particularly important for social simulation where agents represent people. We provide a general solution to this problem through infrastructure that allows the integration of state-of-the-art Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) and ABM systems. In this paper, we demonstrate how this infrastructure is being used to help emergency services in Australia plan for community evacuations.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/780	Dhirendra Singh, Lin Padgham
Limbo: A Reasoning System for Limited Belief	We introduce Limbo, a reasoning system for limited belief. The system features a highly expressive language with first-order quantification, functions and equality, sorts, and introspective belief modalities. Reasoning is based on clause subsumption, unit propagation, and case splits. Decidability and sometimes even tractability is achieved by limiting the number of case splits. We illustrate the practical utility of limited belief with toy examples as well as with the games of Sudoku and Minesweeper.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/779	Christoph Schwering
Real--Time UAV Maneuvering via Automated Planning in Simulations	The automatic generation of realistic behavior such as tactical intercepts for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in air combat is a challenging problem. State-of-the-art solutions propose hand-crafted algorithms and heuristics whose performance depends heavily on the initial conditions and specific aerodynamic characteristics of the UAVs involved. This demo shows the ability of domain-independent planners, embedded into simulators, to generate on-line, feed-forward, control signals that steer simulated aircraft as best suits the situation.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/778	Miquel Ramírez, Michael Papasimeon, Lyndon Behnke, Nir Lipovetzky, Tim Miller, Adrian R.

Speech-based Medical Decision Support in VR using a Deep Neural Network (Demonstration)	We present a speech dialogue system that facilitates medical decision support for doctors in a virtual reality (VR) application. The therapy prediction is based on a recurrent neural network model that incorporates the examination history of patients. A central supervised patient database provides input to our predictive model and allows us, first, to add new examination reports by a pen-based mobile application on-the-fly, and second, to get therapy prediction results in real-time. This demo includes a visualisation of patient records, radiology image data, and the therapy prediction results in VR.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/777	Alexander Prange, Michael Barz, Daniel Sonntag
Automated Planning for Urban Traffic Management	The global growth in urbanisation increases the demand for services including road transport infrastructure, presenting challenges in terms of mobility. Optimising the exploitation of urban road network, while attempting to minimise the effects of traffic emissions, is a great challenge. SimplyfAI was a UK research council grant funded project which was aimed towards solving air quality problems caused by road traffic emissions. Large cities such as Manchester struggle to meet air quality limits as the range of available traffic management devices is limited. In the study, we investigated the application of linked data to enrich environmental and traffic data feeds, and we used this with automated planning tools to enable traffic to be managed at a region level. The management will have the aim of avoiding air pollution problems before they occur. This demo focuses on the planning component, and in particular the engineering and validation aspects, that were pivotal for the success of the project.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/776	Thomas L.

A Goal-Oriented Meaning-based Statistical Multi-Step Math Word Problem Solver with Understanding, Reasoning and Explanation	A goal-oriented meaning-based statistical framework is presented in this paper to solve the math word problem that requires multiple arithmetic operations with understanding, reasoning and explanation. It first analyzes and transforms sentences into their meaning-based logical forms, which represent the associated context of each quantity with role-tags (e.g., nsubj, verb, etc.). Logic forms with role-tags provide a flexible and simple way to specify the physical meaning of a quantity. Afterwards, the main-goal of the problem is decomposed recursively into its associated sub-goals. For each given sub-goal, the associated operator and operands are selected with statistical models. Lastly, it performs inference on logic expressions to get the answer and explains how the answer is obtained in a human comprehensible way. This process thus resembles the human cognitive understanding of the problem and produces a more meaningful problem solving interpretation.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/775	Chao-Chun Liang, Yu-Shiang Wong, Yi-Chung Lin, Keh-Yih Su
Omniscient Debugging for GOAL Agents in Eclipse (Demonstration)	The main goal of our demonstration is to show how omniscient debugging can be applied in practice to cognitive agents. A concrete implementation of the mechanisms proposed in Koeman et. al [2017] has been created for the GOAL agent programming language in the Eclipse environment, integrated with the source-level debugger of Koeman et. al [2016], thus fully implementing the proposal within a state-of-the-art setting.

Libratus: The Superhuman AI for No-Limit Poker	No-limit Texas Hold'em is the most popular variant of poker in the world. Heads-up no-limit Texas Hold'em is the main benchmark challenge for AI in imperfect-information games. We present Libratus, the first - and so far only - AI to defeat top human professionals in that game. Libratus's architecture features three main modules, each of which has new algorithms: pre-computing a solution to an abstraction of the game which provides a high-level blueprint for the strategy of the AI, a new nested subgame-solving algorithm which repeatedly calculates a more detailed strategy as play progresses, and a self-improving module which augments the pre-computed blueprint over time.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/772	Noam Brown, Tuomas Sandholm
Refinement of Intentions	The aim of this paper is to provide a logical analysis of intention refinement process which plays a fundamental role in the belief-desire-intention (BDI) theory. We briefly show the existing results: a logical framework for intention refinement and the extension of hierarchical task network (HTN) planning to capture high-level intentions. We also present two ongoing directions: extending our logical framework with hierarchical decomposition and revision of intentions based on instrumentality.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/771	Zhanhao Xiao
Towards A Relational Approach For Tool Creation By Robots	Like a human, a robot may benefit from being able to use a tool to solve a complex task. When an appropriate tool is not available, a very useful ability for a robot would be to create a novel one based on its past experience. With the advent of inexpensive 3D printing, it is now possible to give robots such an ability, at least to create simple tools. We propose a method for learning how to use an object as a tool and, if needed, to design and construct a new tool.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/770	Handy Wicaksono
Searching for Well-Behaved Fragments of Halpern-Shoham Logic	Temporal reasoning constitutes one of the main topics within the field of Artificial Intelligence. Particularly interesting are interval-based methods, in which time intervals are treated as basic ontological objects, in opposite to point-based methods, where time-points are considered as basic. The former approach is more expressive and seems to be more appropriate for such applications as natural language analysis or real time processes verification. My research concerns the classical interval-based logic, namely Halpern-Shoham logic (HS). In particular, my investigation continues recently proposed search for well-behaved - i.e., expressive enough for practical applications and of low computational complexity - HS fragments obtained by imposing syntactical restrictions on the usage of propositional connectives in their languages.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/769	Przemysław Andrzej Wałęga
Deep Abnormality Detection in Video Data	"Automated detection of anomalous events plays an important role in video surveillance systems in practice. This task, however, requires to deal with three challenging problems of the lack of annotated training data, the inexact description of what to be ""abnormal"" and the expensive feature engineering procedure. Most anomaly detection systems are only able to satisfy some of these challenges. In this work, we propose a deep abnormality detection system to handle all of them simultaneously. Deep abnormality detection is a deep generative network that is an unsupervised probabilistic framework to model the normality and learn feature representation automatically. Furthermore, unlike other existing methods, our system can detect abnormality at multiple levels and be used as a powerful tool for video analysis and scene understanding."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/768	Hung Vu

Search Strategies as Synchronous Processes (Extended Abstract)	Solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) efficiently depends on the solver configuration and the search strategy. However, it is difficult to customize the constraint solvers because they are not modular enough, and it is hard to create new search strategies by composition. To solve these problems, we propose spacetime programming, a paradigm based on lattices and synchronous process calculi that views search strategies as processes working collaboratively towards the resolution of a CSP. We implement the compiler of the language and use it to replace the search module of Choco, a state of the art constraint solver, with an efficient spacetime program that offers better modularity and compositionality of search strategies.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/766	Pierre Talbot
The Role of Textualisation and Argumentation in Understanding the Machine Learning Process	Understanding data, models and predictions is important for machine learning applications. Due to the limitations of our spatial perception and intuition, analysing high-dimensional data is inherently difficult. Furthermore, black-box models achieving high predictive accuracy are widely used, yet the logic behind their predictions is often opaque. Use of textualisation -- a natural language narrative of selected phenomena -- can tackle these shortcomings. When extended with argumentation theory we could envisage machine learning models and predictions arguing persuasively for their choices.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/765	Kacper Sokol, Peter Flach
Using Multiagents for Context-Aware Adaptive Biometrics	This research is motivated by the need to design a biometric system that uses adaptive techniques relevant to a specific context to identify an individual with little or no interaction with the user.

Fuzzy Logic Model for Digital Forensics: A Trade-off between Accuracy, Complexity and Interpretability	The Cyber Crime Investigation is challenged by large and complex data as a key factor of emerging Information and Communication Technologies. The size, the velocity, the variety and the complexity of the data have become so high that data mining approaches are no more efficient since they cannot deal with Big Data. As a result, it can be infeasible to represent specific evidences found in such data in a Court of Law in a human-perceivable manner. Moreover, majority of computational methods result in complex and hardly explainable models. However, Soft Computing, a computing with words, can be beneficial in such case. In particular, hybrid Neuro-Fuzzy is capable of learning understandable and precise fuzzy rule-based model. This paper presents novel improvements of NF architecture and corresponding results.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/763	Andrii Shalaginov
Modeling Bias Reduction Strategies in a Biased Agent	Costly mistakes can occur when decision makers rely on intuition or learned biases to make decisions. To better understand the cognitive processes that lead to bias and develop strategies to combat it, we developed an intelligent agent using the cognitive architecture, ACT-R 7.0. The agent simulates a human participating in a decision making task designed to assess the effectiveness of bias reduction strategies. The agent's performance is compared to that of human participants completing a similar task. Similar results support the underlying cognitive theories and reveal limitations of reducing bias in human decision making. This should provide insights for designing intelligent agents that can reason about bias while supporting decision makers.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/762	Jaelle Scheuerman, Dina Acklin
AToM: An Analogical Theory of Mind	Theory of Mind (ToM) has been well studied in psychology. It is what gives adults the ability to predict other people's beliefs, desires, and related actions. When ToM is not yet developed, as in young children, social interaction is difficult. A cognitive system that interacts with humans on a regular basis would benefit from having a ToM. In this extended abstract, I propose a computational model of ToM, Analogical Theory of Mind (AToM), based on Bach's [2012, 2014] theoretical Structure-Mapping model of ToM. Completed work demonstrates the plausibility of AToM. Future steps include a full implementation and test of AToM.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/761	Irina Rabkina
Teaching Robots through Situated Interactive Dialogue and Visual Demonstrations	The ability to quickly adapt to new environments and incorporate new knowledge is of great importance for robots operating in unstructured environments and interacting with non-expert users. This paper reports on our current progress in tackling this problem. We propose the development of a framework for teaching robots to perform tasks using natural language instructions, visual demonstrations and interactive dialogue. Moreover, we present a module for learning objects incrementally and on-the-fly that would enable robots to ground referents in the natural language instructions and reason about the state of the world.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/760	Jose L.

Operationalizing Operational Logics: Semiotic Knowledge Representations for Interactive Systems	All projects in AI begin by selecting or devising knowledge representations suitable for the project's functional requirements. Interactive systems (including games) have semiotic considerations on top of their functional requirements: they must be legible to users, players, and their own designers. AI working within or around interactive systems must acknowledge and support the concerns of human users. These concerns are generally phrased as inductive bias or domain knowledge and handled in an ad hoc way; I argue that it is possible and useful to represent them explicitly within a unifying approach. This work refines and extends operational logics, an interpretive framework describing how interactive systems communicate their own mechanisms to users. Making this move yields formal notations for interactive systems that are useful for humans and machines, with applications in modeling, verification, general game-playing, reverse-engineering, and automatic self-documentation.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/759	Joseph C.

Nonparametric Online Machine Learning with Kernels	Max-margin and kernel methods are dominant approaches to solve many tasks in machine learning. However, the paramount question is how to solve model selection problem in these methods. It becomes urgent in online learning context. Grid search is a common approach, but it turns out to be highly problematic in real-world applications. Our approach is to view max-margin and kernel methods under a Bayesian setting, then use Bayesian inference tools to learn model parameters and infer hyper-parameters in principle ways for both batch and online setting.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/758	Khanh Nguyen
Curriculum Learning in Reinforcement Learning	Transfer learning in reinforcement learning is an area of research that seeks to speed up or improve learning of a complex target task, by leveraging knowledge from one or more source tasks. This thesis will extend the concept of transfer learning to curriculum learning, where the goal is to design a sequence of source tasks for an agent to train on, such that final performance or learning speed is improved. We discuss completed work on this topic, including methods for semi-automatically generating source tasks tailored to an agent and the characteristics of a target domain, and automatically sequencing such tasks into a curriculum. Finally, we also present ideas for future work.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/757	Sanmit Narvekar

Multi-Agent Systems of Inverse Reinforcement Learners in Complex Games	Real-world problems exhibit a few defining criteria that make them hard for computers to solve. Problems such as driving a car or flying a helicopter have primary goals of reaching a destination as well as doing it safely and timely. These problems must each manage many resources and tasks to achieve their primary goals. The tasks themselves are made up of states that are represented by variables or features. As the feature set grows, the problems become intractable. Computer games are smaller problems but also are representative of real-world problems of this type. In my research, I will look at a particular class of computer game, namely computer role-playing games (RPGs), which are made up of a collection of overarching goals such as improving the player avatar, navigating a virtual world, and keeping the avatar alive. While playing there are also subtasks such as combatting other characters and managing inventory which are not primary, but yet important to overall game play. I will be exploring tiered Reinforcement Learning techniques coupled with training from expert policies using Inverse Reinforcement Learning as a starting point on learning how to play a complex game while attempting to extrapolate ideal goals and rewards.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/755	Dave Mobley
Human-Like Agents for Repeated Negotiation	Virtual agents have been used as tools in negotiation—from acting as mediators to manifesting as full-fledged conversational partners. Virtual agents are a powerful tool for teaching negotiation skills, but require an accurate model of human behavior to perform well both as partners and teachers. The work proposed here aims to expand the current horizon of virtual negotiating agents to utilize human-like strategies. Further agents developed using this framework should be cognizant of the social factors influencing negotiation, including reputation effects and the implications of long-term repeated relationships. A roadmap of current efforts to develop agent platforms and future expansions is discussed.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/754	Johnathan Mell
Resilient Control and Safety for Multi-Agent Cyber-Physical Systems	I develop novel intelligent approximation algorithms for solving modern problems of CPSs, such as control and verification, by combining advanced statistical methods. it is important for the control algorithms underlying the class of multi-agent CPSs to be resilient to various kinds of attacks, and so it is for my algorithms. I have designed a very general adaptive receding-horizon synthesis approach to planning and control that can be applied to controllable stochastic dynamical systems. Apart from being fast and efficient, it provides statistical guarantees of convergence. The optimization technique based on the best features of Model Predictive Control and Particle Swarm Optimization proves to be robust in finding a winning strategy in the stochastic non-cooperative games against a malicious attacker. The technique can further benefit probabilistic model checkers and real-world CPSs.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/753	Anna Lukina
Machine Learning Techniques for MultiAgent Systems	Research in artificial intelligence ranges over many subdisciplines, such as Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and MultiAgent Systems. Recently, AI techniques have become increasingly robust and complex, and there has been enhanced interest in research at the intersection of seemingly disparate research areas. Such work is motivated by the observation that there is actually a great deal of commonality among areas, that can be exploited within subfields. One example of a successful combination is the intersection of machine learning and multiagent systems. For example ,Kearns et al. [2001] proposed an efficient graphical model-based algorithm for calculating Nash equilibria. Going in the other direction, Datta et al. [2015] showed that solution concepts from cooperative game theory can be used to uniquely characterize the influence measure of classifiers.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/752	Yoad Lewenberg
Stochastic Constraint Programming	Combinatorial optimisation problems often contain uncertainty that has to be taken into account to pro- duce realistic solutions. One way of describing the uncertainty is using scenarios, where each sce- nario describes different potential sets of problem parameters based on random distributions or his- torical data. While efficient algorithmic techniques exist for specific problem classes such as linear pro- grams, there are very few approaches that can han- dle general Constraint Programming formulations with uncertainty. The goal of my PhD is to develop generic methods for solving stochastic combina- torial optimisation problems formulated in a Con- straint Programming framework.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/751	David Hemmi
On the Complexity and Expressiveness of Automated Planning Languages Supporting Temporal Reasoning	Automated planning is an important area of Artificial Intelligence, which has been thoroughly developed in the last decades. In recent years, a significant amount of research has focused on planning languages and systems supporting temporal reasoning, recognizing its importance in modeling and solving real-world complex tasks. Many such languages are action-based, i.e. they model planning problems by specifying which actions can be executed at any given time to affect the environment. Timeline-based planning, a different paradigm originally introduced to support planning and scheduling of space operations, models planning domains as systems composed of a set of independent, but interacting, components, whose behavior over time, the timelines, is governed by a set of temporal constraints. A thorough theoretical study of timeline-based planning languages, and a rigorous comparison with action-based languages, are still missing. We outline recent results and future directions on this front.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/750	Nicola Gigante
Efficient Algorithms And Representations For Chance-constrained Mixed Constraint Programming	Resistance to adoption of autonomous systems comes in part from the perceived unreliability of the systems. Concerns can be addressed by approaches that guarantee the probability of success. This is achieved in chance-constrained constraint programming (CC-CP) by imposing constraints required for success, and providing upper-bounds on the probability of violating constraints. This extended abstract reports on novel uncertainty representations to address problems prevalent in current methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/749	Cheng Fang
Constructive Recommendation	"Constructive recommendation is the task of recommending object ""configurations"", i.e. objects that can be assembled from their components on the basis of the user preferences. Examples include: PC configurations, recipes, travel plans, layouts, and other structured objects. Recommended objects are created by maximizing a learned utility function over an exponentially (or even infinitely) large combinatorial space of configurations. The utility function is learned through preference elicitation, an interactive process for collecting user feedback about recommended objects. Constructive recommendation brings up a wide range of possible applications as well as many untackled research problems, ranging from the unprecedented complexity of the inference problem to the nontrivial choice of the type of user interaction."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/748	Paolo Dragone
SAT-Based Approaches for the General High School Timetabling Problem	High School Timetabling (HSTT) is a well known and widespread problem. It consists of coordinating resources (e.g. teachers, rooms), times, and events (e.g. lectures) with respect to various constraints. In this paper, I summarize the work I have done towards exploring the relationship between propositional logic and HSTT. This includes various modeling techniques in the form of maxSAT and bitvectors, data structures for local search algorithms, and the combination of maxSAT and metaheuristic algorithms. In addition, I discuss possible directions for future work as a part of a long-term research goal to combine complete and metaheuristic algorithms.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/747	Emir Demirović
Online Algorithm Selection	Algorithm selection approaches have achieved impressive performance improvements in many areas of AI. Most of the literature considers the offline algorithm selection problem, where the initial selection model is never updated after training. However, new data from running algorithms on instances becomes available while an algorithm selection method is in use. In this extended abstract, the online algorithm selection problem is considered. In online algorithm selection, additional data can be processed, and the selection model can change over time. This abstract details the online algorithm setting, shows that it is a contextual multi-armed bandit, proposes a solution methodology, and empirically validates it.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/746	Hans Degroote
Understanding and Measuring Collective Intelligence Across Different Cognitive Systems: An Information-Theoretic Approach	We develop the idea of collective intelligence by analysing a range of factors hindering the effectiveness of interactive cognitive agents. We give insights into how to explore the potential of collectives across different cognitive systems (human, animal and machine) and research areas. The endeavour is to bridge the different research disciplines in which collective intelligence might occur and apply the studies of intelligence in AI to other fields, thereby cross-fertilising diverse areas of study ranging from business and management to social sciences and fundamental biology.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/745	Nader Chmait
Learning Multi-faceted Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Natural Language Processing	Knowledge graphs have challenged the present embedding-based approaches for representing their multifacetedness. To address some of the issues, we have investigated some novel approaches that (i) captures multilingual transitions on different language-specific versions of knowledge, and (ii) encodes the commonly existing monolingual knowledge with important relational properties and hierarchies. In addition, we propose the use of our approaches in a wide spectrum of NLP tasks that have not been well explored by related works.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/744	Muhao Chen, Carlo Zaniolo
A Framework for Long-Term Learning Systems	Increasing amounts of data have made the use of machine learning techniques much more widespread. A lot of research in machine learning has been dedicated to the design and application of effective and efficient algorithms to explain or predict facts. The development of intelligent machines that can learn over extended periods of time, and that improve their abilities as they execute more tasks, is still a pending contribution from computer science to the world. This weakness has been recognised for some decades, and an interest to solve it seems to be increasing, as demonstrated by recent leading work and broader discussions at main events in the field [Chen and Liu, 2015; Chen et al., 2016]. Our research is intended to help fill that gap.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/743	Diana Benavides-Prado
Securing and scaling cryptocurrencies	Bitcoin, a protocol for a new permissionless decentralized digital currency hailed the arrival of a new application domain for computer science. Following Bitcoin's arrival, a series of innovations derived from the state of the art in several fields has been applied to cryptocurrencies, and has been slowly reshaping monetary and financial instruments on public distributed ledgers. It was soon clear however that Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies still require additional improvements. This challenging domain presents researchers in the field with new and exciting questions. I provide examples from two main research threads, related to the scalability of the protocol and to its underlying incentives.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/742	Aviv Zohar
Improving Group Decision-Making by Artificial Intelligence	We summarize some of our recent work on using AI to improve group decision-making by taking a unified approach from statistics, economics, and computation.

Unsupervised Learning via Total Correlation Explanation	"Learning by children and animals occurs effortlessly and largely without obvious supervision. Successes in automating supervised learning have not translated to the more ambiguous realm of unsupervised learning where goals and labels are not provided. Barlow (1961) suggested that the signal that brains leverage for unsupervised learning is dependence, or redundancy, in the sensory environment. Dependence can be characterized using the information-theoretic multivariate mutual information measure called total correlation. The principle of Total Cor-relation Ex-planation (CorEx) is to learn representations of data that ""explain"" as much dependence in the data as possible. We review some manifestations of this principle along with successes in unsupervised learning problems across diverse domains including human behavior, biology, and language."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/740	Greg Ver Steeg
Reinforcement mechanism design	We put forward a modeling and algorithmic framework to design and optimize mechanisms in dynamic industrial environments where a designer can make use of the data generated in the process to automatically improve future design. Our solution, coined reinforcement mechanism design, is rooted in game theory but incorporates recent AI techniques to get rid of nonrealistic modeling assumptions and to make automated optimization feasible. We instantiate our framework on the key application scenarios of Baidu and Taobao, two of the largest mobile app companies in China. For the Taobao case, our framework automatically designs mechanisms that allocate buyer impressions for the e-commerce website; for the Baidu case, our framework automatically designs dynamic reserve pricing schemes of advertisement auctions of the search engine. Experiments show that our solutions outperform the state-of-the-art alternatives and those currently deployed, under both scenarios.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/739	Pingzhong Tang
Towards Certified Unsolvability in Classical Planning	While it is easy to verify that an action sequence is a solution for a classical planning task, there is no such verification capability if a task is reported unsolvable. We are therefore interested in certificates that allow an independent verification of the absence of solutions. We identify promising concepts for certificates that can be generated by a wide range of planning approaches. We present a first proposal of unsolvability certificates and sketch ideas how the underlying concepts can be used as part of a more flexible unsolvability proof system.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/738	Gabriele Röger
Multimodal News Article Analysis	The intersection of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing has been a hot topic of research in recent years, with results that were unthinkable only a few years ago. In view of this progress, we want to highlight online news articles as a potential next step for this area of research. The rich interrelations of text, tags, images or videos, as well as a vast corpus of general knowledge are an exciting benchmark for high-capacity models such as the deep neural networks. In this paper we present a series of tasks and baseline approaches to leverage corpus such as the BreakingNews dataset.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/737	Arnau Ramisa
Knowledge Engineering for Intelligent Decision Support	Knowledge can be seen as the collection of skills and information an individual (or group) has acquired through experience, while intelligence as the ability to apply such knowledge. In many areas of Artificial Intelligence, we have been focusing for the last 40 years on the formalization and development of automated ways of finding and collecting data, as well as on the construction of models to represent that data adequately in a way that an automated system can make sense of it. However, in order to achieve real artificial intelligence we need to go beyond data and knowledge representation, and deeper into how such a system could, and would, use available knowledge in order to empower and enhance the capabilities of humans in making decisions in real-world applications. From my point of view, an AI should be able to combine automatically acquired data and knowledge together with specific domain expertise from the users that the tool is expected to help.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/736	María Vanina Martínez
Learning from Data Heterogeneity: Algorithms and Applications	Nowadays, as an intrinsic property of big data, data heterogeneity can be seen in a variety of real-world applications, ranging from security to manufacturing, from healthcare to crowdsourcing. It refers to any inhomogeneity in the data, and can be present in a variety of forms, corresponding to different types of data heterogeneity, such as task/view/instance/oracle heterogeneity. As shown in previous work as well as our own work, learning from data heterogeneity not only helps people gain a better understanding of the large volume of data, but also provides a means to leverage such data for effective predictive modeling. In this paper, along with multiple real applications, we will briefly review state-of-the-art techniques for learning from data heterogeneity, and demonstrate their performance at addressing these real world problems.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/735	Jingrui He

Logic meets Probability: Towards Explainable AI Systems for Uncertain Worlds	Logical AI is concerned with formal languages to represent and reason with qualitative specifications; statistical AI is concerned with learning quantitative specifications from data. To combine the strengths of these two camps, there has been exciting recent progress on unifying logic and probability. We review the many guises for this union, while emphasizing the need for a formal language to represent a system's knowledge. Formal languages allow their internal properties to be robustly scrutinized, can be augmented by adding new knowledge, and are amenable to abstractions, all of which are vital to the design of intelligent systems that are explainable and interpretable.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/733	Vaishak Belle
Game Theoretic Analysis of Security and Sustainability	Computational game theory has become a powerful tool to address critical issues in security and sustainability. Casting the security resource allocation problem as a Stackelberg game, novel algorithms have been developed to provide randomized security resource allocations. These algorithms have led to deployed security-game based decision aids for many real-world security domains including infrastructure security and wildlife protection. We contribute to this community by addressing several major research challenges in complex security resource allocation, including dynamic payoffs, uncertainty, protection externality, games on networks, and strategic secrecy. We also analyze optimal security resource allocation in many potential application domains including cyber security. Furthermore, we apply game theory to reasoning optimal policy in deciding taxi pricing scheme and EV charging placement and pricing.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/732	Bo An
Robotic Strategic Behavior in Adversarial Environments	The presence of robots in areas containing threats is becoming more prevalent, due to their ability to perform missions accurately, efficiently, and with little risk to humans. Having the robots handle adversarial forces in missions such as search and rescue, intelligence gathering, border protection and humanitarian assistance, raises many new, exciting research challenges. This paper describes recent research achievements in areas related to robotic mission planning in adversarial environments, including multi-robot patrolling, robotic coverage, multi-robot formation, and navigation, and suggests possible future research directions.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/731	Noa Agmon
POPPONENT: Highly accurate, individually and socially efficient opponent preference model in bilateral multi issue negotiations (Extended Abstract)	In automated bilateral multi issue negotiations, two intelligent automated agents negotiate on behalf of their owners over many issues in order to reach an agreement. Modeling the opponent can excessively boost the performance of the agents and increase the quality of the negotiation outcome. State of the art models accomplish this by considering some assumptions about the opponent which restricts their applicability in real scenarios. In this paper, a less restricted technique where perceptron units (POPPONENT) are applied in modelling the preferences of the opponent is proposed. This model adopts a Multi Bipartite version of the Standard Gradient Descent search algorithm (MBGD) to find the best hypothesis, which is the best preference profile. In order to evaluate the accuracy and performance of this proposed opponent model, it is compared with the state of the art models available in the Genius repository. This results in the devised setting which approves the higher accuracy of POPPONENT compared to the most accurate state of the art model. Evaluating the model in the real world negotiation scenarios in the Genius framework also confirms its high accuracy in relation to the state of the art models in estimating the utility of offers. The findings here indicate that the proposed model is individually and socially efficient. This proposed MBGD method could also be adopted in similar practical areas of Artificial Intelligence.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/730	Farhad Zafari, Faria Nassiri-Mofakham
Text Rewriting Improves Semantic Role Labeling (Extended Abstract)	Large-scale annotated corpora are a prerequisite to developing high-performance NLP systems. Such corpora are expensive to produce, limited in size, often demanding linguistic expertise. In this paper we use text rewriting as a means of increasing the amount of labeled data available for model training. Our method uses automatically extracted rewrite rules from comparable corpora and bitexts to generate multiple versions of sentences annotated with gold standard labels. We apply this idea to semantic role labeling and show that a model trained on rewritten data outperforms the state of the art on the CoNLL-2009 benchmark dataset.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/729	Kristian Woodsend, Mirella Lapata
Local Search for Minimum Weight Dominating Set with Two-Level Configuration Checking and Frequency Based Scoring Function (Extended Abstract)	The Minimum Weight Dominating Set (MWDS) problem is an important generalization of the Minimum Dominating Set (MDS) problem with extensive applications. This paper proposes a new local search algorithm for the MWDS problem, which is based on two new ideas. The first idea is a heuristic called two-level configuration checking (CC2), which is a new variant of a recent powerful configuration checking strategy (CC) for effectively avoiding the recent search paths. The second idea is a novel scoring function based on the frequency of being uncovered of vertices. Our algorithm is called CC2FS, according to the names of the two ideas. The experimental results show that, CC2FS performs much better than some state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution quality on a broad range of MWDS benchmarks.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/728	Yiyuan Wang, Shaowei Cai, Minghao Yin
Exploiting Causality for Selective Belief Filtering in Dynamic Bayesian Networks (Extended Abstract)	Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are a general model for stochastic processes with partially observed states. Belief filtering in DBNs is the task of inferring the belief state (i.e. the probability distribution over process states) based on incomplete and uncertain observations. In this article, we explore the idea of accelerating the filtering task by automatically exploiting causality in the process. We consider a specific type of causal relation, called passivity, which pertains to how state variables cause changes in other variables. We present the Passivity-based Selective Belief Filtering (PSBF) method, which maintains a factored belief representation and exploits passivity to perform selective updates over the belief factors. PSBF is evaluated in both synthetic processes and a simulated multi-robot warehouse, where it outperformed alternative filtering methods by exploiting passivity.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/727	Stefano V.

Robots in Retirement Homes: Applying Off-the-Shelf Planning and Scheduling to a Team of Assistive Robots (Extended Abstract)	We investigate Constraint Programming and Planning Domain Definition Language-based technologies for planning and scheduling multiple robots in a retirement home environment to assist elderly residents. Our robotics problem and investigation into proposed solution approaches provide a real world application of planning and scheduling, while highlighting the different modeling assumptions required to solve such a problem. This information is valuable to the planning and scheduling community as it provides insight into potential application avenues, in particular for robotics problems. Based on empirical results, we conclude that a constraint-based scheduling approach, specifically a decomposition using constraint programming, provides the most promising results for our application.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/726	Tony T.

A generic approach to planning in the presence of incomplete information: Theory and implementation (Extended Abstract)	This paper proposes a generic approach to planning in the presence of incomplete information. The approach builds on an abstract notion of a belief state representation, along with an associated set of basic operations. These operations facilitate the development of a sound and complete transition function, for reasoning about effects of actions in the presence of incomplete information, and a set of abstract algorithms for planning. The paper demonstrates how the abstract definitions and algorithms can be instantiated in three concrete representations—minimal-DNF, minimal-CNF, and prime implicates—resulting in three highly competitive conformant planners: DNF, CNF, and PIP. The paper relates the notion of a representation to that of ordered binary decision diagrams, a well-known belief state representation employed by many conformant planners, and several target compilation languages that have been presented in the literature.The paper also includes an experimental evaluation of the planners DNF, CNF, and PIP and proposes a new set of conformant planning benchmarks that are challenging for state-of-the-art conformant planners.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/725	Son Thanh To, Tran Cao Son, Enrico Pontelli
On the Expressivity of Inconsistency Measures (Extended Abstract)	We survey recent approaches to inconsistency measurement in propositional logic and provide a comparative analysis in terms of their expressivity. For that, we introduce four different expressivity characteristics that quantitatively assess the number of different knowledge bases that a measure can distinguish. Our approach aims at complementing ongoing discussions on rationality postulates for inconsistency measures by considering expressivity as a desirable property. We evaluate a large selection of measures on the proposed characteristics and conclude that a distance-based measure from [Grant and Hunter, 2013] has maximal expressivity along all considered characteristics.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/724	Matthias Thimm
Some Properties of Batch Value of Information in the Selection Problem (Extended Abstract)	"We examine theoretical properties of value of information (VOI) in the selection problem, and identify cases of submodularity and supermodularity.

Evaluating Epistemic Negation in Answer Set Programming (Extended Abstract)	Epistemic negation 'not' along with default negation 'neg' plays a key role in knowledge representation and nonmonotonic reasoning. However, the existing approaches behave not satisfactorily in that they suffer from the problems of unintended world views due to recursion through the epistemic modal operator K or M ( K F and M F are shorthands for (neg not F) and (not neg F), respectively). In this paper we present a general approach to epistemic negation which is free of unintended world views and thus offers a solution to the long-standing problem of epistemic specifications which were introduced by Gelfond 1991 over two decades ago.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/722	Yi-Dong Shen, Thomas Eiter
Generating Models of a Matched Formula With a Polynomial Delay (Extended Abstract)	A matched formula is a CNF formula whose incidence graph admits a matching which matches a distinct variable to every clause. Such a formula is always satisfiable. Matched formulas are used, for example, in the area of parameterized complexity. We prove that the problem of counting the number of the models (satisfying assignments) of a matched formula is #P-complete. On the other hand, we define a class of formulas generalizing the matched formulas and prove that for a formula in this class one can choose in polynomial time a variable suitable for splitting the tree for the search of the models of the formula. As a consequence, the models of a formula from this class, in particular of any matched formula, can be generated sequentially with a delay polynomial in the size of the input. On the other hand, we prove that this task cannot be performed efficiently for linearly satisfiable formulas, which is a generalization of matched formulas containing the class considered above.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/721	Petr Savický, Petr Kučera
News Across Languages - Cross-Lingual Document Similarity and Event Tracking (Extended Abstract)	In today's world, we follow news which is distributed globally. Significant events are reported by different sources and in different languages. In this work, we address the problem of tracking of events in a large multilingual stream. Within a recently developed system Event Registry we examine two aspects of this problem: how to compare articles in different languages and how to link collections of articles in different languages which refer to the same event. Building on previous work, we show there are methods which scale well and can compute a meaningful similarity between articles from languages with little or no direct overlap in the training data.Using this capability, we then propose an approach to link clusters of articles across languages which represent the same event.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/720	Jan Rupnik, Andrej Muhič, Gregor Leban, Blaž Fortuna, Marko Grobelnik
Construction of System of Spheres-based Transitively Relational Partial Meet Multiple Contractions: An Impossibility Result (Extended Abstract)	In this paper we show that, contrary to what is the case in what concerns contractions by a single sentence, there is not a system of spheres-based construction of multiple contractions which generates each and every transitively relational partial meet multiple contraction. Furthermore, we propose two system of spheres-based constructions of multiple contractions which generate (only) transitively relational partial meet multiple contractions.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/719	Maurício D.

Relations Between Spatial Calculi About Directions and Orientations (Extended Abstract)	A qualitative representation of space and/or time provides mechanisms which characterize the essential properties of objects or configurations. The advantages over quantitative representations can be: (1) a better match with human concepts related to natural language, and (2) better efficiency for reasoning. The two main trends in qualitative spatial constraint reasoning are topological reasoning about regions and reasoning about directions between points and straight lines and orientations of straight lines or configurations derived from points. In this work, we apply universal algebraic tools to binary qualitative calculi and their relations.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/718	Till Mossakowski, Reinhard Moratz
Approximate Value Iteration with Temporally Extended Actions (Extended Abstract)	The options framework provides a concrete way to implement and reason about temporally extended actions. Existing literature has demonstrated the value of planning with options empirically, but there is a lack of theoretical analysis formalizing when planning with options is more efficient than planning with primitive actions. We provide a general analysis of the convergence rate of a popular Approximate Value Iteration (AVI) algorithm called Fitted Value Iteration (FVI) with options. Our analysis reveals that longer duration options and a pessimistic estimate of the value function both lead to faster convergence. Furthermore, options can improve convergence even when they are suboptimal and sparsely distributed throughout the state space. Next we consider generating useful options for planning based on a subset of landmark states. This suggests a new algorithm, Landmark-based AVI (LAVI), that represents the value function only at landmark states. We analyze OFVI and LAVI using the proposed landmark-based options and compare the two algorithms. Our theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that options can play an important role in AVI by decreasing approximation error and inducing fast convergence.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/717	Timothy A.

CCEHC: An Efficient Local Search Algorithm for Weighted Partial Maximum Satisfiability (Extended Abstract)	Weighted partial maximum satisfiability (WPMS) is a significant generalization of maximum satisfiability (MAX-SAT), with many important applications. Recently, breakthroughs have been made on stochastic local search (SLS) for weighted MAX-SAT and (unweighted) partial MAX-SAT (PMS). However, the performance of SLS for WPMS lags far behind. In this work, we present a new SLS algorithm named CCEHC for WPMS. CCEHC is mainly based on a heuristic emphasizing hard clauses, which has three components: a variable selection mechanism focusing on configuration checking based only on hard clauses, a weighting scheme for hard clauses, and a biased random walk component. Experiments show that CCEHC significantly outperforms its state-of-the-art SLS competitors. Experiments comparing CCEHC with a state-of-the-art complete solver indicate the effectiveness of CCEHC on a number of application WPMS instances.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/716	Chuan Luo, Shaowei Cai, Kaile Su, Wenxuan Huang
AutoFolio: An Automatically Configured Algorithm Selector (Extended Abstract)	Algorithm selection (AS) techniques -- which involve choosing from a set of algorithms the one expected to solve a given problem instance most efficiently -- have substantially improved the state of the art in solving many prominent AI problems, such as SAT, CSP, ASP, MAXSAT and QBF. Although several AS procedures have been introduced, not too surprisingly, none of them dominates all others across all AS scenarios. Furthermore, these procedures have parameters whose optimal values vary across AS scenarios. In this extended abstract of our 2015 JAIR article of the same title, we summarize AutoFolio, which uses an algorithm configuration procedure to automatically select an AS approach and optimize its parameters for a given AS scenario. AutoFolio allows researchers and practitioners across a broad range of applications to exploit the combined power of many different AS methods and to automatically construct high-performance algorithm selectors. We demonstrate that AutoFolio was able to produce new state-of-the-art algorithm selectors for 7 well-studied AS scenarios and matches state-of-the-art performance statistically on all other scenarios. Compared to the best single algorithm for each AS scenario, AutoFolio achieved average speedup factors between 1.3 and 15.4.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/715	Marius Lindauer, Frank Hutter, Holger H.

On Redundant Topological Constraints (Extended Abstract)	Redundancy checking is an important task in AI subfields such as knowledge representation and constraint solving. This paper considers redundant topological constraints, defined in the region connection calculus RCC8. We say a constraint in a set C of RCC8 constraints is redundant if it is entailed by the rest of C. A prime subnetwork of C is a subset of C which contains no redundant constraints and has the same solution set as C. It is natural to ask how to compute such a prime subnetwork, and when it is unique. While this problem is in general intractable, we show that, if S is a subalgebra of RCC8 in which weak composition distributes over nonempty intersections, then C has a unique prime subnetwork, which can be obtained in cubic time by removing all redundant constraints simultaneously from C. As a by-product, we show that any path-consistent network over such a distributive subalgebra is minimal.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/714	Sanjiang Li, Zhiguo  Long, Weiming Liu, Matt Duckham, Alan Both

New Canonical Representations by Augmenting OBDDs with Conjunctive Decomposition (Extended Abstract)	We identify two families of canonical representations called ROBDD[/\i^]_C and ROBDD[/\T^,i]_T by augmenting ROBDD with two types of conjunctive decompositions. These representations cover the three existing languages ROBDD, ROBDD with as many implied literals as possible (ROBDD-L_&infin), and AND/OR BDD. We introduce a new time efficiency criterion called rapidity which reflects the idea that exponential operations may be preferable if the language can be exponentially more succinct. Then we demonstrate that the expressivity, succinctness and operation rapidity do not decrease from ROBDD[/\T^,i]_T to ROBDD[/\i^]_C, and then to ROBDD[/\i+1^]_C. We also demonstrate that ROBDD[/\i^]_C (i > 1) and ROBDD[/\T^,i]_T are not less tractable than ROBDD-L_&infin and ROBDD, respectively. Finally, we develop a compiler for ROBDD[/\&infin^]_C which significantly advances the compiling efficiency of canonical representations.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/712	Yong Lai, Dayou Liu, Minghao Yin
Computer Models Solving Intelligence Test Problems: Progress and Implications (Extended Abstract)	While some computational models of intelligence test problems were proposed throughout the second half of the XXth century, in the first years of the XXIst century we have seen an increasing number of computer systems being able to score well on particular intelligence test tasks. However, despitethis increasing trend there has been no general account of all these works in terms of how theyrelate to each other and what their real achievements are. In this paper, we provide some insighton these issues by giving a comprehensive account of about thirty computer models, from the 1960sto nowadays, and their relationships, focussing on the range of intelligence test tasks they address, thepurpose of the models, how general or specialised these models are, the AI techniques they use in eachcase, their comparison with human performance, and their evaluation of item difficulty.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/711	José Hernández-Orallo, Fernando Martínez-Plumed, Ute  Schmid, Michael Siebers, David Dowe
The Ceteris Paribus Structure of Logics of Game Forms (Extended Abstract)	We present a simple Ceteris Paribus Logic (CP) and study its relationship with existing logics that deal with the representation of choice and power in games in normal form including atemporal STIT, Coalition Logic of Propositional Control (CL-PC) and Dynamic Logic of Propositional Assignments (DL-PA). Thanks to the polynomial reduction of the satisfiability problem for atemporal STIT in the satisfiability problem for CP, we obtain a complexity result for the latter problem.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/710	Davide  Grossi, Emiliano Lorini, François Schwarzentruber
Coherent Predictive Inference under Exchangeability with Imprecise Probabilities (Extended Abstract)	Coherent reasoning under uncertainty can be represented in a very general manner by coherent sets of desirable gambles. This leads to a more general foundation for coherent (imprecise-)probabilistic inference that allows for indecision. In this framework, and for a given finite category set, coherent predictive inference under exchangeability can be represented using Bernstein coherent cones of multivariate polynomials on the simplex generated by this category set. We define an inference system as a map that associates a Bernstein coherent cone of polynomials with every finite category set. Inference principles can then be represented mathematically as restrictions on such maps, which allows us to develop a notion of conservative inference under such inference principles. We discuss, as particular examples, representation insensitivity and specificity, and show that there is an infinity of inference systems that satisfy these two principles.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/709	Gert de Cooman, Jasper De Bock, Márcio Alves Diniz
Bayesian Network Structure Learning with Integer Programming: Polytopes, Facets and Complexity (Extended Abstract)	Developing accurate algorithms for learning structures of probabilistic graphical models is an important problem within modern AI research. Here we focus on score-based structure learning for Bayesian networks as arguably the most central class of graphical models. A successful generic approach to optimal Bayesian network structure learning (BNSL), based on integer programming (IP), is implemented in the Gobnilp system. Despite the recent algorithmic advances, current understanding of foundational aspects underlying the IP based approach to BNSL is still somewhat lacking. In this paper, we provide theoretical contributions towards understanding fundamental aspects of cutting planes and the related separation problem in this context, ranging from NP-hardness results to analysis of polytopes and the related facets in connection to BNSL.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/708	James Cussens, Matti Järvisalo, Janne H.

Efficient Mechanism Design for Online Scheduling (Extended Abstract)	This work concerns the mechanism design for online scheduling in a strategic setting. In this setting, each job is owned by a self-interested agent who may misreport the release time, deadline, length, and value of her job, while we need to determine not only the schedule of the jobs, but also the payment of each agent. We focus on the design of incentive compatible (IC) mechanisms, and study the maximization of social welfare (i.e., the aggregated value of completed jobs) by competitive analysis. We first derive two lower bounds on the competitive ratio of any deterministic IC mechanism to characterize the landscape of our research: one bound is 5, which holds for equal-length jobs; the other bound is $\frac{\kappa}{\ln\kappa}+1-o(1)$, which holds for unequal-length jobs, where $\kappa$ is the maximum ratio between lengths of any two jobs. We then propose a deterministic IC mechanism and show that such a simple mechanism works very well for two models: (1) In the preemption-restart model, the mechanism can achieve the optimal competitive ratio of 5 for equal-length jobs and a near optimal ratio of $(\frac{1}{(1-\epsilon)^2}+o(1)) \frac{\kappa}{\ln\kappa}$ for unequal-length jobs, where $0	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/707	Xujin Chen, Xiaodong Hu, Tie-Yan Liu, Weidong Ma, Tao Qin, Pingzhong Tang, Changjun Wang, Bo Zheng
On Minimum Representations of Matched Formulas (Extended Abstract)	A Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) is called matched if the system of sets of variables which appear in individual clauses has a system of distinct representatives. We present here two results for matched CNFs: The first result is a shorter and simpler proof of the fact that Boolean minimization remains complete for the second level of polynomial hierarchy even if the input is restricted to matched CNFs. The second result is structural --- we show that if a Boolean function f admits a representation by a matched CNF then every clause minimum CNF representation of f is matched.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/706	Ondřej Čepek, Štefan Gurský, Petr Kučera
A New Semantics for Overriding in Description Logics (Extended Abstract)	Nonmonotonic inferences are not yet supported by Description Logic technology, although their potential usefulness is widely recognized. Lack of support to nonmonotonic reasoning is due to a number of issues related to expressiveness, computational complexity, and optimizations. This work contributes to the practical support of nonmonotonic reasoning in description logics by introducing a new semantics designed to address knowledge engineering needs. The formalism is validated through extensive comparison with the other nonmonotonic DLs, and systematic scalability tests.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/705	Piero Bonatti, Marco Faella, Iliana M.

Automatic Description Generation from Images: A Survey of Models, Datasets, and Evaluation Measures (Extended Abstract)	Automatic image description generation is a challenging problem that has recently received a large amount of interest from the computer vision and natural language processing communities. In this survey, we classify the known approaches based on how they conceptualise this problem and provide a review of existing models, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, we give an overview of the benchmark image-text datasets and the evaluation measures that have been developed to assess the quality of machine-generated descriptions. Finally we explore future directions in the area of automatic image description.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/704	Raffaella Bernardi, Ruket Cakici, Desmond Elliott, Aykut Erdem, Erkut Erdem, Nazli Ikizler-Cinbis, Frank Keller, Adrian Muscat, Barbara Plank
Robust Multilingual Named Entity Recognition with Shallow Semi-supervised Features (Extended Abstract)	We present a multilingual Named Entity Recognition approach based on a robust and general set of features across languages and datasets. Our system combines shallow local information with clustering semi-supervised features induced on large amounts of unlabeled text. Understanding via empiricalexperimentation how to effectively combine various types of clustering features allows us to seamlessly export our system to other datasets and languages. The result is a simple but highly competitive system which obtains state of the art results across five languages and twelve datasets. The results are reported on standard shared task evaluation data such as CoNLL for English, Spanish and Dutch. Furthermore, and despite the lack of linguistically motivated features, we also report best results for languages such as Basque and German. In addition, we demonstrate that our method also obtains very competitive results even when the amount of supervised data is cut by half, alleviating the dependency on manually annotated data. Finally, the results show that our emphasis on clustering features is crucial to develop robust out-of-domain models. The system and models are freely available to facilitate its use and guarantee the reproducibility of results.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/703	Rodrigo Agerri, German Rigau
Maximizing Awareness about HIV in Social Networks of Homeless Youth with Limited Information	This paper presents HEALER, a software agent that recommends sequential intervention plans for use by homeless shelters, who organize these interventions to raise awareness about HIV among homeless youth. HEALER's sequential plans (built using knowledge of social networks of homeless youth) choose intervention participants strategically to maximize influence spread, while reasoning about uncertainties in the network. While previous work presents influence maximizing techniques to choose intervention participants, they do not address two real-world issues: (i) they completely fail to scale up to real-world sizes; and (ii) they do not handle deviations in execution of intervention plans. HEALER handles these issues via two major contributions: (i) HEALER casts this influence maximization problem as a POMDP and solves it using a novel planner which scales up to previously unsolvable real-world sizes; and (ii) HEALER allows shelter officials to modify its recommendations, and updates its future plans in a deviation-tolerant manner. HEALER was deployed in the real world in Spring 2016 with considerable success.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/702	Amulya Yadav, Hau Chan, Albert Xin Jiang, Haifeng Xu, Eric Rice, Milind Tambe
I-dual: Solving Constrained SSPs via Heuristic Search in the Dual Space	We consider the problem of generating optimal stochastic policies for Constrained Stochastic Shortest Path problems, which are a natural model for planning under uncertainty for resource-bounded agents with multiple competing objectives. While unconstrained SSPs enjoy a multitude of efficient heuristic search solution methods with the ability to focus on promising areas reachable from the initial state, the state of the art for constrained SSPs revolves around linear and dynamic programming algorithms which explore the entire state space. In this paper, we present i-dual, the first heuristic search algorithm for constrained SSPs. To concisely represent constraints and efficiently decide their violation, i-dual operates in the space of dual variables describing the policy occupation measures. It does so while retaining the ability to use standard value function heuristics computed by well-known methods. Our experiments show that these features enable i-dual to achieve up to two orders of magnitude improvement in run-time and memory over linear programming algorithms.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/701	Felipe Trevizan, Sylvie Thiebaux, Pedro Santana, Brian Williams
Value Iteration Networks	We introduce the value iteration network (VIN): a fully differentiable neural network with a `planning module' embedded within. VINs can learn to plan, and are suitable for predicting outcomes that involve planning-based reasoning, such as policies for reinforcement learning. Key to our approach is a novel differentiable approximation of the value-iteration algorithm, which can be represented as a convolutional neural network, and trained end-to-end using standard backpropagation.We evaluate VIN based policies on discrete and continuous path-planning domains, and on a natural-language based search task. We show that by learning an explicit planning computation, VIN policies generalize better to new, unseen domains.This paper is a significantly abridged and IJCAI audience targeted version of the original NIPS 2016 paper with the same title, available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02867	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/700	Aviv Tamar, Yi Wu, Garrett Thomas, Sergey Levine, Pieter Abbeel
Local Topic Discovery via Boosted Ensemble of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization	Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been increasingly popular for topic modeling of large-scale documents. However, the resulting topics often represent only general, thus redundant information about the data rather than minor, but potentially meaningful information to users. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel ensemble model of nonnegative matrix factorization for discovering high-quality local topics. Our method leverages the idea of an ensemble model to successively perform NMF given a residual matrix obtained from previous stages and generates a sequence of topic sets. The novelty of our method lies in the fact that it utilizes the residual matrix inspired by a state-of-the-art gradient boosting model and applies a sophisticated local weighting scheme on the given matrix to enhance the locality of topics, which in turn delivers high-quality, focused topics of interest to users.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/699	Sangho Suh, Jaegul Choo, Joonseok Lee, Chandan K.

Evaluating Market User Interfaces for Electric Vehicle Charging using Bid2Charge	We consider settings where electric vehicle drivers participate in a market mechanism to charge their vehicles. Existing work typically assumes that participants are fully rational and can report their charging preferences accurately. However, this may not be reasonable in settings with non-experts. To explore this, we design a novel game called Bid2Charge and compare a fully expressive interface that covers the entire space of preferences to two restricted interfaces that offer fewer possible reports. We show that restricting the users' preferences significantly reduces deliberation times while also leading to an increase in utility by up to 70%.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/698	Sebastian Stein, Enrico H.

Adapting Deep Network Features to Capture Psychological Representations: An Abridged Report	Deep neural networks have become increasingly successful at solving classic perception problems (e.g., recognizing objects), often reaching or surpassing human-level accuracy. In this abridged report of Peterson et al. [2016], we examine the relationship between the image representations learned by these networks and those of humans. We find that deep features learned in service of object classification account for a significant amount of the variance in human similarity judgments for a set of animal images. However, these features do not appear to capture some key qualitative aspects of human representations. To close this gap, we present a method for adapting deep features to align with human similarity judgments, resulting in image representations that can potentially be used to extend the scope of psychological experiments and inform human-centric AI.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/697	Joshua C.

Grounding Abstract Spatial Concepts for Language Interaction with Robots	"Our goal is to develop models that allow a robot to understand or ``ground"" natural language instructionsin the context of its world model. Contemporary approaches estimate correspondences between an instruction and possible candidate groundings such as objects, regions and goals for a robot's action. However, these approaches are unable to reason about abstract or hierarchical concepts such as rows, columns and groups that are relevant in a manipulation domain. We introduce a probabilistic model that incorporates an expressive space of abstract spatial concepts as well as notions of cardinality and ordinality. Abstract concepts are introduced as explicit hierarchical symbols correlated with concrete groundings. Crucially, the abstract groundings form a Markov boundary over concrete groundings, effectively de-correlating them from the remaining variables in the graph which reduces the complexity of training and inference in the model. Empirical evaluation demonstrates accurate grounding of abstract concepts embedded in complex natural language instructions commanding a robot manipulator. The proposed inference method leads to significant efficiency gains compared to the baseline, with minimal trade-off in accuracy."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/696	Rohan Paul, Jacob Arkin, Nicholas Roy, Thomas M.

nanoCoP: Natural Non-clausal Theorem Proving	Most efficient fully automated theorem provers implement proof search calculi that require the input formula to be in a clausal form, i.e. disjunctive or conjunctive normal form. The translation into clausal form introduces a significant overhead to the proof search and modifies the structure of the original formula. Translating a proof in clausal form back into a more readable non-clausal proof of the original formula is not straightforward. This paper presents a non-clausal automated theorem prover for classical first-order logic. It is based on a non-clausal connection calculus and implemented with a few lines of Prolog code. Working entirely on the original structure of the input formula yields not only a speed up of the proof search, but the resulting non-clausal proofs are also shorter.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/695	Jens Otten

Dynamical System-Based Motion Planning for Multi-Arm Systems: Reaching for Moving Objects	The use of coordinated multi-arm robotic systems allows to preform manipulations of heavy or bulky objects that would otherwise be infeasible for a single-arm robot. This paper concisely introduces our work on coordinated multi-arm control [Salehian et al., 2016a], where we proposed a virtual object based dynamical systems (DS) control law to generate autonomous and synchronized motions for a multi-arm robot system. We show theoretically and empirically that the multi-arm + virtual object system converges asymptotically to a moving object. The proposed framework is validated on a dual-arm robotic system. We demonstrate that it can re-synchronize and adapt the motion of each arm in a fraction of a second, even when the object's motion is fast and not accurately predictable.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/693	Seyed Sina Mirrazavi Salehian, Nadia Figueroa, Aude Billard
The Many Benefits of Annotator Rationales for Relevance Judgments	When collecting subjective human ratings of items, it can be difficult to measure and enforce data quality due to task subjectivity and lack of insight into how judges arrive at each rating decision. To address this, we propose requiring judges to provide a specific type of rationale underlying each rating decision. We evaluate this approach in the domain of Information Retrieval, where human judges rate the relevance of Webpages. Cost-benefit analysis over 10,000 judgments collected on Mechanical Turk suggests a win-win: experienced crowd workers provide rationales with no increase in task completion time while providing further benefits, including more reliable judgments and greater transparency.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/692	Tyler McDonnell, Mucahid Kutlu, Tamer Elsayed, Matthew Lease
Competence Guided Model for Casebase Maintenance	A competence guided casebase maintenance algorithm retains a case in the casebase if it is useful to solve many problems and ensures that the casebase is highly competent. In this paper, we address the compositional adaptation process (of which single case adaptation is a special case) during casebase maintenance by proposing a case competence model for which we propose a measure called retention score to estimate the retention quality of a case. We also propose a revised algorithm based on the retention score to estimate the competent subset of a casebase. We used synthetic datasets to test the effectiveness of the competent subset obtained from the proposed model. We also applied this model in a tutoring application and analyzed the competent subset of concepts in tutoring resources. Empirical results show that the proposed model is effective and overcomes the limitation of footprint-based competence model in compositional adaptation applications.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/691	Ditty Mathew, Sutanu Chakraborti
Self-Adjusting Memory: How to Deal with Diverse Drift Types	Data Mining in non-stationary data streams is particularly relevant in the context of the Internet of Things and Big Data. Its challenges arise from fundamentally different drift types violating assumptions of data independence or stationarity. Available methods often struggle with certain forms of drift or require unavailable a priori task knowledge. We propose the Self-Adjusting Memory (SAM) model for the k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm. SAM-kNN can deal with heterogeneous concept drift, i.e. different drift types and rates. Its basic idea are dedicated models for current and former concepts used according to the demands of the given situation. It can be robustly applied in practice without meta parameter optimization. We conduct an extensive evaluation on various benchmarks, consisting of artificial streams with known drift characteristics and real-world datasets. Highly competitive results throughout all experiments underline the robustness of SAM-kNN as well as its capability to handle heterogeneous concept drift.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/690	Viktor Losing, Barbara  Hammer, Heiko Wersing
A SAT Approach to Branchwidth	Branch decomposition is a prominent method for structurally decomposing a graph, hypergraph or CNF formula. The width of a branch decomposition provides a measure of how well the object is decomposed. For many applications it is crucial to compute a branch decomposition whose width is as small as possible. We propose a SAT approach to finding branch decompositions of small width. The core of our approach is an efficient SAT encoding which determines with a single SAT-call whether a given hypergraph admits a branch decomposition of certain width. For our encoding we develop a novel partition-based characterization of branch decompositions. The encoding size imposes a limit on the size of the given hypergraph. In order to break through this barrier and to scale the SAT approach to larger instances, we develop a new heuristic approach where the SAT encoding is used to locally improve a given candidate decomposition until a fixed-point is reached. This new method scales now to instances with several thousands of vertices and edges.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/689	Neha Lodha, Sebastian Ordyniak, Stefan Szeider
On Thompson Sampling and Asymptotic Optimality	We discuss some recent results on Thompson sampling for nonparametric reinforcement learning in countable classes of general stochastic environments. These environments can be non-Markovian, non-ergodic, and partially observable. We show that Thompson sampling learns the environment class in the sense that (1) asymptotically its value converges in mean to the optimal value and (2) given a recoverability assumption regret is sublinear. We conclude with a discussion about optimality in reinforcement learning.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/688	Jan Leike, Tor Lattimore, Laurent Orseau, Marcus Hutter
Blockedness in Propositional Logic: Are You Satisfied With Your Neighborhood?	Clause-elimination techniques that simplify formulas by removing redundant clauses play an important role in modern SAT solving. Among the types of redundant clauses, blocked clauses are particularly popular. For checking whether a clause C is blocked in a formula F, one only needs to consider the so-called resolution neighborhood of C, i.e., the set of clauses that can be resolved with C. Because of this, blocked clauses are referred to as being locally redundant. In this paper, we discuss powerful generalizations of blocked clauses that are still locally redundant, viz. set-blocked clauses and super-blocked clauses. We furthermore present complexity results for deciding whether a clause is set-blocked or super-blocked.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/687	Benjamin Kiesl, Martina Seidl, Hans Tompits, Armin Biere
An End-to-End System for Accomplishing Tasks with Modular Robots: Perspectives for the AI community	The advantage of modular robot systems lies in their flexibility, but this advantage can only be realized if there exists some reliable, effective way of generating configurations (shapes) and behaviors (controlling programs) appropriate for a given task. In this paper, we present an end-to-end system for addressing tasks with modular robots, and demonstrate that it is capable of accomplishing challenging multi-part tasks in hardware experiments. The system consists of four tightly integrated components: (1) A high-level mission planner, (2) A design library spanning a wide set of functionality, (3) A design and simulation tool for populating the library with new configurations and behaviors, and (4) Modular robot hardware.

Learning and Applying Case Adaptation Rules for Classification: An Ensemble Approach	The ability of case-based reasoning systems to solve novel problems depends on their capability to adapt past solutions to new circumstances. However, acquiring the knowledge required for case adaptation is a classic challenge for CBR. This motivates the use of machine learning methods to generate adaptation knowledge. A popular approach uses the case difference heuristic (CDH) to generate adaptation rules from pairs of cases in the case base, based on the premise that the observed differences in case solutions result from the differences in the problems they solve, so can form the basic of rules to adapt cases with similar problem differences. Extensive research has successfully applied the CDH approach to adaptation rule learning for case-based regression (numerical prediction) tasks. However, classification tasks have been outside of its scope. The work presented in this paper addresses that gap by extending CDH-based learning of adaptation rules to apply to cases with categorical features and solutions. It presents the generalized case value heuristic to assess case and solution differences and applies it in an ensemble-based case-based classification method, ensembles of adaptations for classification (EAC), built on the authors' previous work on ensembles of adaptations for regression (EAR). Experimental results support the effectiveness of EAC.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/685	Vahid Jalali, David Leake, Najmeh Forouzandehmehr
Summary: Multi-Agent Path Finding with Kinematic Constraints	Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is well studied in both AI and robotics. Given a discretized environment and agents with assigned start and goal locations, MAPF solvers from AI find collision-free paths for hundreds of agents with user-provided sub-optimality guarantees. However, they ignore that actual robots are subject to kinematic constraints (such as velocity limits) and suffer from imperfect plan-execution capabilities. We therefore introduce MAPF-POST to postprocess the output of a MAPF solver in polynomial time to create a plan-execution schedule that can be executed on robots. This schedule works on non-holonomic robots, considers kinematic constraints, provides a guaranteed safety distance between robots, and exploits slack to avoid time-intensive replanning in many cases. We evaluate MAPF-POST in simulation and on differential-drive robots, showcasing the practicality of our approach.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/684	Wolfgang Hönig, T. K.

First-Order Modular Logic Programs and their Conservative Extensions (Extended Abstract)	This paper introduces first-order modular logic programs, which provide a way of viewing answer set programs as consisting of many independent, meaningful modules. We also present conservative extensions of such programs. This concept helps to identify strong relationships between modular programs as well as between traditional programs. For example, we illustrate how the notion of a conservative extension can be used to justify the common projection rewriting.

Model Accuracy and Runtime Tradeoff in Distributed Deep Learning: A Systematic Study	Deep learning with a large number of parame-ters requires distributed training, where model accuracy and runtime are two important factors to be considered. However, there has been no systematic study of the tradeoff between these two factors during the model training process. This paper presents Rudra, a parameter server based distributed computing framework tuned for training large-scale deep neural networks. Using variants of the asynchronous stochastic gradient descent algorithm we study the impact of synchronization protocol, stale gradient updates, minibatch size, learning rates, and number of learners on runtime performance and model accuracy. We introduce a new learningrate modulation strategy to counter the effect of stale gradients and propose a new synchronization protocol that can effectively bound the staleness in gradients, improve runtime performance and achieve good model accuracy. Our empirical investigation reveals a principled approach for distributed training of neural networks: the mini-batch size per learner should be reduced as more learners are added to the system to preserve the model accuracy. We validate this approach using commonly-used image classification benchmarks: CIFAR10 and ImageNet.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/681	Suyog Gupta, Wei Zhang, Fei Wang
Multi-Type Activity Recognition from a Robot's Viewpoint	The literature in computer vision is rich of works where different types of activities -- single actions, two persons interactions or ego-centric activities, to name a few -- have been analyzed. However, traditional methods treat such types of activities separately, while in real settings detecting and recognizing different types of activities simultaneously is necessary. We first design a new unified descriptor, called Relation History Image (RHI), which can be extracted from all the activity types we are interested in. We then formulate an optimization procedure to detect and recognize activities of different types. We assess our approach on a new dataset recorded from a robot-centric perspective as well as on publicly available datasets, and evaluate its quality compared to multiple baselines.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/680	Ilaria Gori, J.

Which is the Fairest (Rent Division) of Them All? [Extended Abstract]	"What is a fair way to assign rooms to several housemates, and divide the rent between them? This is not just a theoretical question: many people have used the Spliddit website to obtain envy-free solutions to rent division instances. But envy freeness, in and of itself, is insufficient to guarantee outcomes that people view as intuitive and acceptable. We therefore focus on solutions that optimize a criterion of social justice, subject to the envy freeness constraint, in order to pinpoint the ""fairest"" solutions. We develop a general algorithmic framework that enables the computation of such solutions in polynomial time. We then study the relations between natural optimization objectives, and identify the maximin solution, which maximizes the minimum utility subject to envy freeness, as the most attractive. We demonstrate, in theory and using experiments on real data from Spliddit, that the maximin solution gives rise to significant gains in terms of our optimization objectives. Finally, a user study with Spliddit users as subjects demonstrates that people find the maximin solution to be significantly fairer than arbitrary envy-free solutions; this user study is unprecedented in that it asks people about their real-world rent division instances. Based on these results, the maximin solution has been deployed on Spliddit since April 2015."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/678	Ya'akov (Kobi) Gal, Moshe Mash, Ariel D. Procaccia, Yair Zick
Lexicons on Demand: Neural Word Embeddings for Large-Scale Text Analysis	"Human language is colored by a broad range of topics, but existing text analysis tools only focus on a small number of them. We present Empath, a tool that can generate and validate new lexical categories on demand from a small set of seed terms (like ""bleed"" and ""punch"" to generate the category violence). Empath draws connotations between words and phrases by learning a neural embedding across billions of words on the web. Given a small set of seed words that characterize a category, Empath uses its neural embedding to discover new related terms, then validates the category with a crowd-powered filter. Empath also analyzes text across 200 built-in, pre-validated categories we have generated such as neglect, government, and social media. We show that Empath's data-driven, human validated categories are highly correlated (r=0.906) with similar categories in LIWC."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/677	Ethan Fast, Binbin Chen, Michael S.

Lessons from the Amazon Picking Challenge: Four Aspects of Building Robotic Systems	We describe the winning entry to the Amazon Picking Challenge 2015. From the experience of building this system and competing, we derive several conclusions: (1) We suggest to characterize robotic system building along four key aspects, each of them spanning a spectrum of solutions - modularity vs. integration, generality vs. assumptions, computation vs. embodiment, and planning vs. feedback. (2) To understand which region of each spectrum most adequately addresses which robotic problem, we must explore the full spectrum of possible approaches. (3) For manipulation problems in unstructured environments, certain regions of each spectrum match the problem most adequately, and should be exploited further. This is supported by the fact that our solution deviated from the majority of the other challenge entries along each of the spectra.

The underlying idea in our approach is to dynamically augment the task with some dummy (artificial) events at different times throughout the task, rewarding the worker upon identifying and reporting them. The proposed approach is an alternative to the traditional approach of exclusively relying on rewarding the worker for successfully identifying the event of interest itself. We propose three methods for timing the dummy events throughout the task. Two of these methods are static and determine the timing of the dummy events at random or uniformly throughout the task. The third method is dynamic and uses the identification (or misidentification) of dummy events as a signal for the worker's attention to the task, adjusting the rate of dummy events generation accordingly.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/675	Avshalom Elmalech, David Sarne, Esther David, Chen Hajaj
User-Based Opinion-based Recommendation	User-generated reviews are a plentiful source of user opinions and interests and can play an important role in a range of artificial intelligence contexts, particularly when it comes to recommender systems. In this paper, we describe how natural language processing and opinion mining techniques can be used to automatically mine useful recommendation knowledge from user generated reviews and how this information can be used by recommender systems in a number of classical settings.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/674	Ruihai Dong, Barry Smyth
Intuitionistic Layered Graph Logic	Models of complex systems are widely used in the physical and social sciences, and the concept of layering, typically building upon graph-theoretic structure, is a common feature. We describe an intuitionistic substructural logic that gives an account of layering. As in other bunched systems, the logic includes the usual intuitionistic connectives, together with a non-commutative, non-associative conjunction (used to capture layering) and its associated implications. We give a soundness and completeness theorem for a labelled tableaux system with respect to a Kripke semantics on graphs. To demonstrate the utility of the logic, we show how to represent systems and security examples, illuminating the relationship between services/policies and the infrastructures/architectures to which they are applied.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/673	Simon Docherty, David Pym
Ensuring Rapid Mixing and Low Bias for Asynchronous Gibbs Sampling	Gibbs sampling is a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique commonly used for estimating marginal distributions. To speed up Gibbs sampling, there has recently been interest in parallelizing it by executing asynchronously. While empirical results suggest that many models can be efficiently sampled asynchronously, traditional Markov chain analysis does not apply to the asynchronous case, and thus asynchronous Gibbs sampling is poorly understood. In this paper, we derive a better understanding of the two main challenges of asynchronous Gibbs: bias and mixing time. We show experimentally that our theoretical results match practical outcomes.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/672	Christopher De Sa, Kunle Olukotun, Christopher Ré
Predicting Human Similarity Judgments with Distributional Models: The Value of Word Associations	To represent the meaning of a word, most models use external language resources, such as text corpora, to derive the distributional properties of word usage. In this study, we propose that internal language models, that are more closely aligned to the mental representations of words, can be used to derive new theoretical questions regarding the structure of the mental lexicon. A comparison with internal models also puts into perspective a number of assumptions underlying recently proposed distributional text-based models could provide important insights into cognitive science, including linguistics and artificial intelligence. We focus on word-embedding models which have been proposed to learn aspects of word meaning in a manner similar to humans and contrast them with internal language models derived from a new extensive data set of word associations. An evaluation using relatedness judgments shows that internal language models consistently outperform current state-of-the art text-based external language models. This suggests alternative approaches to represent word meaning using properties that aren't encoded in text.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/671	Simon De Deyne, Amy Perfors, Daniel J. Navarro
Efficient Techniques for Crowdsourced Top-k Lists	We focus on the problem of obtaining top-k lists of items from larger itemsets, using human workers for doing comparisons among items.An example application is short-listing a large set of college applications using advanced students as workers. We describe novel efficient techniques and explore their tolerance to adversarial behavior and the tradeoffs among different measures of performance (latency, expense and quality of results). We empirically evaluate the proposed techniques against prior art using simulations as well as real crowds in Amazon Mechanical Turk. A randomized variant of the proposed algorithms achieves significant budget saves, especially for very large itemsets and large top-k lists, with negligible risk of lowering the quality of the output.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/670	Luca de Alfaro, Vassilis Polychronopoulos, Neoklis Polyzotis
Open-World Probabilistic Databases: An Abridged Report	Large-scale probabilistic knowledge bases are becoming increasingly important in academia and industry alike. They are constantly extended with new data, powered by modern information extraction tools that associate probabilities with database tuples. In this paper, we revisit the semantics underlying such systems. In particular, the closed-world assumption of probabilistic databases, that facts not in the database have probability zero, clearly conflicts with their everyday use. To address this discrepancy, we propose an open-world probabilistic database semantics, which relaxes the probabilities of open facts to default intervals. For this open-world setting, we lift the existing data complexity dichotomy of probabilistic databases, and propose an efficient evaluation algorithm for unions of conjunctive queries. We also show that query evaluation can become harder for non-monotone queries.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/669	Ismail Ilkan Ceylan, Adnan Darwiche, Guy Van den Broeck
Concerning Referring Expressions in Query Answers	A referring expression in linguistics is a noun phrase that identifies individuals to listeners. In the context of a query over a first order knowledge base, referring expressions to answers are usually constant symbols. This paper motivates and initiates the exploration of allowing more general formulas, called singular referring expressions, to replace constants in this role. Referring expression types play a novel and significant role in analyzing the properties of candidate expressions.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/668	Alexander Borgida, David Toman, Grant Weddell
A Verified SAT Solver Framework with Learn, Forget, Restart, and Incrementality	We developed a formal framework for SAT solving using the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant. Through a chain of refinements, an abstract CDCL (conflict-driven clause learning) calculus is connected to a SAT solver that always terminates with correct answers. The framework offers a convenient way to prove theorems about the SAT solver and experiment with variants of the calculus. Compared with earlier verifications, the main novelties are the inclusion of the CDCL rules for forget, restart, and incremental solving and the use of refinement.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/667	Jasmin Christian Blanchette, Mathias Fleury, Christoph Weidenbach
Unsatisfiable Core Shrinking for Anytime Answer Set Optimization	Efficient algorithms for the computation of optimum stable models are based on unsatisfiable core analysis. However, these algorithms essentially run to completion, providing few or even no suboptimal stable models. This drawback can be circumvented by shrinking unsatisfiable cores. Interestingly, the resulting anytime algorithm can solve more instances than the original algorithm.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/666	Mario Alviano, Carmine Dodaro
Rationalisation of Profiles of Abstract Argumentation Frameworks: Extended Abstract	We review a recently introduced model in which each of a number of agents is endowed with an abstract argumentation framework reflecting her individual views regarding a given set of arguments. A question arising in this context is whether the diversity of views observed in such a situation is consistent with the assumption that every individual argumentation framework is induced by a combination of, first, some basic factual information and, second, the personal preferences of the agent concerned. We treat this question of rationalisability of a profile as an algorithmic problem and identify tractable and intractable cases. This is useful for understanding what types of profiles can reasonably be expected to occur in a multiagent system.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/665	Stephane Airiau, Elise Bonzon, Ulle Endriss, Nicolas Maudet, Julien Rossit
Online Decision-Making for Scalable Autonomous Systems	We present a general formal model called MODIA that can tackle a central challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs), namely the ability to interact with an unspecified, large number of world entities. In MODIA, a collection of possible decision-problems (DPs), known a priori, are instantiated online and executed as decision-components (DCs), unknown a priori. To combine their individual action recommendations of the DCs into a single action, we propose the lexicographic executor action function (LEAF) mechanism. We analyze the complexity of MODIA and establish LEAF's relation to regret minimization. Finally, we implement MODIA and LEAF using collections of partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) DPs, and use them for complex AV intersection decision-making. We evaluate the approach in six scenarios within an industry-standard vehicle simulator, and present its use on an AV prototype.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/664	Kyle Hollins Wray, Stefan J.

Privacy and Autonomous Systems	We discuss the problem of privacy in autonomous systems, introducing different conceptualizations and perspectives on privacy to assess the threats that autonomous systems may pose to privacy. After this, we outline socio-technical and legal measures that should be put in place to mitigate these threats. Beyond privacy threats and countermeasures, we also argue how autonomous systems may be, at the same time, the key to address some of the most challenging and pressing privacy problems nowadays and in the near future.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/663	Jose M.

Should Robots be Obedient?	Intuitively, obedience -- following the order that a human gives -- seems like a good property for a robot to have. But, we humans are not perfect and we may give orders that are not best aligned to our preferences. We show that when a human is not perfectly rational then a robot that tries to infer and act according to the human's underlying preferences can always perform better than a robot that simply follows the human's literal order. Thus, there is a tradeoff between the obedience of a robot and the value it can attain for its owner. We investigate how this tradeoff is impacted by the way the robot infers the human's preferences, showing that some methods err more on the side of obedience than others. We then analyze how performance degrades when the robot has a misspecified model of the features that the human cares about or the level of rationality of the human. Finally, we study how robots can start detecting such model misspecification. Overall, our work suggests that there might be a middle ground in which robots intelligently decide when to obey human orders, but err on the side of obedience.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/662	Smitha Milli, Dylan Hadfield-Menell, Anca Dragan, Stuart Russell
Concrete Problems for Autonomous Vehicle Safety: Advantages of Bayesian Deep Learning	Autonomous vehicle (AV) software is typically composed of a pipeline of individual components, linking sensor inputs to motor outputs. Erroneous component outputs propagate downstream, hence safe AV software must consider the ultimate effect of each component's errors. Further, improving safety alone is not sufficient. Passengers must also feel safe to trust and use AV systems. To address such concerns, we investigate three under-explored themes for AV research: safety, interpretability, and compliance. Safety can be improved by quantifying the uncertainties of component outputs and propagating them forward through the pipeline. Interpretability is concerned with explaining what the AV observes and why it makes the decisions it does, building reassurance with the passenger. Compliance refers to maintaining some control for the passenger. We discuss open challenges for research within these themes. We highlight the need for concrete evaluation metrics, propose example problems, and highlight possible solutions.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/661	Rowan McAllister, Yarin Gal, Alex Kendall, Mark van der Wilk, Amar Shah, Roberto Cipolla, Adrian Weller
Context-Based Reasoning on Privacy in Internet of Things	More and more, devices around us are being connected to each other in the realm of Internet of Things (IoT). Their communication and especially collaboration promises useful services to be provided to end users. However, the same communication channels pose important privacy concerns to be raised. It is not clear which information will be shared with whom, for which intents, under which conditions. Existing approaches to privacy advocate policies to be in place to regulate privacy. However, the scale and heterogeneity of the IoT entities make it infeasible to maintain policies among each and every entity in the system. Conversely, it is best if each entity can reason on the privacy using norms and context autonomously. Accordingly, this paper proposes an approach where each entity finds out which contexts it is in based on information it gathers from other entities in the system. The proposed approach uses argumentation to enable IoT entities to reason about their context and decide to reveal information based on it. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach over an IoT scenario.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/660	Nadin Kokciyan, Pinar Yolum
Achieving Coordination in Multi-Agent Systems by Stable Local Conventions under Community Networks	Recently, the study of social conventions has attracted much attention in the literature. We notice that a type of interesting phenomena, local convention phenomena, may also exist in certain multi-agent systems. When agents are partitioned into compact communities, different local conventions emerge in different communities. In this paper, we provide a definition for local conventions, and propose two metrics measuring their strength and diversity. In our experimental study, we show that agents can achieve coordination via establishing diverse stable local conventions, which indicates a practical way to solve coordination problems other than the traditional global convention emergence. Moreover, we find that with smaller community sizes, denser connections and fewer available actions, diverse local conventions emerge in shorter time.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/659	Shuyue Hu, Ho-fung Leung
On Automating the Doctrine of Double Effect	The doctrine of double effect (DDE) is a long-studied ethical principle that governs when actions that have both positive and negative effects are to be allowed. The goal in this paper is to automate DDE. We briefly present DDE, and use a first-order modal logic, the deontic cognitive event calculus, as our framework to formalize the doctrine. We present formalizations of increasingly stronger versions of the principle, including what is known as the doctrine of triple effect. We then use our framework to simulate successfully scenarios that have been used to test the presence of the principle in human subjects. Our framework can be used in two different modes. One can use it to build DDE-compliant autonomous systems from scratch, or one can use it to verify that a given AI system is DDE-complaint, by applying a DDE layer on an existing system or model. For the latter mode, the underlying AI system can be built using any architecture (planners, deep neural networks, bayesian networks, knowledge-representation systems, or a hybrid); as long as the system exposes a few parameters in its model, such verification is possible. The role of the DDE layer here is akin to a (dynamic or static) software verifier that examines existing software modules. Finally, we end by sketching initial work on how one can apply our DDE layer to the STRIPS-style planning model, and to a modified POMDP model. This is preliminary work to illustrate the feasibility of the second mode, and we hope that our initial sketches can be useful for other researchers in incorporating DDE in their own frameworks.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/658	Naveen Sundar Govindarajulu, Selmer Bringsjord
A Goal Reasoning Agent for Controlling UAVs in Beyond-Visual-Range Air Combat	We describe the Tactical Battle Manager (TBM), an intelligent agent that uses several integrated artificial intelligence techniques to control an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle in simulated beyond-visual-range (BVR) air combat scenarios. The TBM incorporates goal reasoning, automated planning, opponent behavior recognition, state prediction, and discrepancy detection to operate in a real-time, dynamic, uncertain, and adversarial environment. We describe evidence from our empirical study that the TBM significantly outperforms an expert-scripted agent in BVR scenarios. We also report the results of an ablation study which indicates that all components of our agent architecture are needed to maximize mission performance.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/657	Michael W.

Reinforcement Learning with a Corrupted Reward Channel	No real-world reward function is perfect. Sensory errors and software bugs may result in agents getting higher (or lower) rewards than they should. For example, a reinforcement learning agent may prefer states where a sensory error gives it the maximum reward, but where the true reward is actually small. We formalise this problem as a generalised Markov Decision Problem called Corrupt Reward MDP. Traditional RL methods fare poorly in CRMDPs, even under strong simplifying assumptions and when trying to compensate for the possibly corrupt rewards. Two ways around the problem are investigated. First, by giving the agent richer data, such as in inverse reinforcement learning and semi-supervised reinforcement learning, reward corruption stemming from systematic sensory errors may sometimes be completely managed. Second, by using randomisation to blunt the agent's optimisation, reward corruption can be partially managed under some assumptions.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/656	Tom Everitt, Victoria Krakovna, Laurent Orseau, Shane Legg
Responsible Autonomy	As intelligent systems are increasingly making decisions that directly affect society, perhaps the most important upcoming research direction in AI is to rethink the ethical implications of their actions. Means are needed to integrate moral, societal and legal values with technological developments in AI, both during the design process as well as part of the deliberation algorithms employed by these systems. In this paper, we describe leading ethics theories and propose alternative ways to ensure ethical behavior by artificial systems. Given that ethics are dependent on the socio-cultural context and are often only implicit in deliberation processes, methodologies are needed to elicit the values held by designers and stakeholders, and to make these explicit leading to better understanding and trust on artificial autonomous systems.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/655	Virginia Dignum
Algorithmic Bias in Autonomous Systems	"Algorithms play a key role in the functioning of autonomous systems, and so concerns have periodically been raised about the possibility of algorithmic bias. However, debates in this area have been hampered by different meanings and uses of the term, ""bias."" It is sometimes used as a purely descriptive term, sometimes as a pejorative term, and such variations can promote confusion and hamper discussions about when and how to respond to algorithmic bias. In this paper, we first provide a taxonomy of different types and sources of algorithmic bias, with a focus on their different impacts on the proper functioning of autonomous systems. We then use this taxonomy to distinguish between algorithmic biases that are neutral or unobjectionable, and those that are problematic in some way and require a response. In some cases, there are technological or algorithmic adjustments that developers can use to compensate for problematic bias. In other cases, however, responses require adjustments by the agent, whether human or autonomous system, who uses the results of the algorithm. There is no ""one size fits all"" solution to algorithmic bias."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/654	David Danks, Alex John London
When Will Negotiation Agents Be Able to Represent Us? The Challenges and Opportunities for Autonomous Negotiators	Computers that negotiate on our behalf hold great promise for the future and will even become indispensable in emerging application domains such as the smart grid and the Internet of Things. Much research has thus been expended to create agents that are able to negotiate in an abundance of circumstances. However, up until now, truly autonomous negotiators have rarely been deployed in real-world applications. This paper sizes up current negotiating agents and explores a number of technological, societal and ethical challenges that autonomous negotiation systems have brought about. The questions we address are: in what sense are these systems autonomous, what has been holding back their further proliferation, and is their spread something we should encourage? We relate the automated negotiation research agenda to dimensions of autonomy and distill three major themes that we believe will propel autonomous negotiation forward: accurate representation, long-term perspective, and user trust. We argue these orthogonal research directions need to be aligned and advanced in unison to sustain tangible progress in the field.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/653	Tim Baarslag, Michael Kaisers, Enrico H.

Plato's Cave in the Dempster-Shafer land--the Link between Pignistic and Plausibility Transformations	In reasoning under uncertainty in AI, there are (at least) two useful and different ways of understanding beliefs: the first is as absolute belief or degree of belief in propositions and the second is as belief update or measure of change in belief. Pignistic and plausibility transformations are two well-known probability transformations that map belief functions to probability functions in the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. In this paper, we establish the link between pignistic and plausibility transformations by devising a belief-update framework for belief functions where plausibility transformation works on belief update while pignistic transformation operates on absolute belief. In this framework, we define a new belief-update operator connecting the two transformations, and interpret the framework in a belief-function model of parametric statistical inference. As a metaphor, these two transformations projecting the belief-update framework for belief functions to that for probabilities are likened to the fire projecting reality into shadows on the wall in Plato's cave.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/652	Chunlai Zhou, Biao Qin, Xiaoyong Du
Approximating Discrete Probability Distribution of Image Emotions by Multi-Modal Features Fusion	Existing works on image emotion recognition mainly assigned the dominant emotion category or average dimension values to an image based on the assumption that viewers can reach a consensus on the emotion of images. However, the image emotions perceived by viewers are subjective by nature and highly related to the personal and situational factors. On the other hand, image emotions can be conveyed by different features, such as semantics and aesthetics. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning approach that formulates the categorical image emotions as a discrete probability distribution (DPD). To associate emotions with the extracted visual features, we present a weighted multi-modal shared sparse leaning to learn the combination coefficients, with which the DPD of an unseen image can be predicted by linearly integrating the DPDs of the training images. The representation abilities of different modalities are jointly explored and the optimal weight of each modality is automatically learned. Extensive experiments on three datasets verify the superiority of the proposed method, as compared to the state-of-the-art.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/651	Sicheng Zhao, Guiguang Ding, Yue Gao, Jungong Han
Dynamic Programming Bipartite Belief Propagation For Hyper Graph Matching	Hyper graph matching problems have drawn attention recently due to their ability to embed higher order relations between nodes. In this paper, we formulate hyper graph matching problems as constrained MAP inference problems in graphical models. Whereas previous discrete approaches introduce several global correspondence vectors, we introduce only one global correspondence vector, but several local correspondence vectors. This allows us to decompose the problem into a (linear) bipartite matching problem and several belief propagation sub-problems. Bipartite matching can be solved by traditional approaches, while the belief propagation sub-problem is further decomposed as two sub-problems with optimal substructure. Then a newly proposed dynamic programming procedure is used to solve the belief propagation sub-problem. Experiments show that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art techniques for hyper graph matching.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/650	Zhen Zhang, Julian McAuley, Yong Li, Wei Wei, Yanning Zhang, Qinfeng Shi
Single-Image 3D Scene Parsing Using Geometric Commonsense	This paper presents a unified grammatical framework capable of reconstructing a variety of scene types (e.g., urban, campus, county etc.) from a single input image. The key idea of our approach is to study a novel commonsense reasoning framework that mainly exploits two types of prior knowledges: (i) prior distributions over a single dimension of objects, e.g., that the length of a sedan is about 4.5 meters; (ii) pair-wise relationships between the dimensions of scene entities, e.g., that the length of a sedan is shorter than a bus. These unary or relative geometric knowledge, once extracted, are fairly stable across different types of natural scenes, and are informative for enhancing the understanding of various scenes in both 2D images and 3D world. Methodologically, we propose to construct a hierarchical graph representation as a unified representation of the input image and related geometric knowledge. We formulate these objectives with a unified probabilistic formula and develop a data-driven Monte Carlo method to infer the optimal solution with both bottom-to-up and top-down computations. Results with comparisons on public datasets showed that our method clearly outperforms the alternative methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/649	Chengcheng Yu, Xiaobai Liu, Song-Chun Zhu
Robust Quadratic Programming for Price Optimization	The goal of price optimization is to maximize total revenue by adjusting the prices of products, on the basis of predicted sales numbers that are functions of pricing strategies. Recent advances in demand modeling using machine learning raise a new challenge in price optimization, i.e., how to manage statistical errors in estimation. In this paper, we show that uncertainty in recently-proposed prescriptive price optimization frameworks can be represented by a matrix normal distribution. For this particular uncertainty, we propose novel robust quadratic programming algorithms for conservative lower-bound maximization. We offer an asymptotic probabilistic guarantee of conservativeness of our formulation. Our experiments on both artificial and actual price data show that our robust price optimization allows users to determine best risk-return trade-offs and to explore safe, profitable price strategies.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/648	Akihiro Yabe, Shinji Ito, Ryohei Fujimaki
XOR-Sampling for Network Design with Correlated Stochastic Events	Many network optimization problems can be formulated as stochastic network design problems in which edges are present or absent stochastically. Furthermore, protective actions can guarantee that edges will remain present. We consider the problem of finding the optimal protection strategy under a budget limit in order to maximize some connectivity measurements of the network. Previous approaches rely on the assumption that edges are independent. In this paper, we consider a more realistic setting where multiple edges are not independent due to natural disasters or regional events that make the states of multiple edges stochastically correlated. We use Markov Random Fields to model the correlation and define a new stochastic network design framework. We provide a novel algorithm based on Sample Average Approximation (SAA) coupled with a Gibbs or XOR sampler. The experimental results on real road network data show that the policies produced by SAA with the XOR sampler have higher quality and lower variance compared to SAA with Gibbs sampler.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/647	Xiaojian Wu, Yexiang Xue, Bart Selman, Carla P.

Scalable Estimation of Dirichlet Process Mixture Models on Distributed Data	We consider the estimation of Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMMs) in distributed environments, where data are distributed across multiple computing nodes. A key advantage of Bayesian nonparametric models such as DPMMs is that they allow new components to be introduced on the fly as needed. This, however, posts an important challenge to distributed estimation -- how to handle new components efficiently and consistently. To tackle this problem, we propose a new estimation method, which allows new components to be created locally in individual computing nodes. Components corresponding to the same cluster will be identified and merged via a probabilistic consolidation scheme. In this way, we can maintain the consistency of estimation with very low communication cost. Experiments on large real-world data sets show that the proposed method can achieve high scalability in distributed and asynchronous environments without compromising the mixing performance.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/646	Ruohui Wang, Dahua Lin
Order Statistics for Probabilistic Graphical Models	We consider the problem of computing r-th order statistics, namely finding an assignment having rank r in a probabilistic graphical model. We show that the problem is NP-hard even when the graphical model has no edges (zero-treewidth models) via a reduction from the partition problem. We use this reduction, specifically a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for number partitioning to yield a pseudo-polynomial time approximation algorithm for solving the r-th order statistics problem in zero- treewidth models. We then extend this algorithm to arbitrary graphical models by generalizing it to tree decompositions, and demonstrate via experimental evaluation on various datasets that our proposed algorithm is more accurate than sampling algorithms.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/645	David Smith, Sara Rouhani, Vibhav Gogate
Efficient Inference for Untied MLNs	We address the problem of scaling up local-search or sampling-based inference in Markov logic networks (MLNs) that have large shared sub-structures but no (or few) tied weights. Such untied MLNs are ubiquitous in practical applications. However, they have very few symmetries, and as a result lifted inference algorithms--the dominant approach for scaling up inference--perform poorly on them. The key idea in our approach is to reduce the hard, time-consuming sub-task in sampling algorithms, computing the sum of weights of features that satisfy a full assignment, to the problem of computing a set of partition functions of graphical models, each defined over the logical variables in a first-order formula. The importance of this reduction is that when the treewidth of all the graphical models is small, it yields an order of magnitude speedup. When the treewidth is large, we propose an over-symmetric approximation and experimentally demonstrate that it is both fast and accurate.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/644	Somdeb Sarkhel, Deepak Venugopal, Nicholas Ruozzi, Vibhav Gogate
Weighted Model Integration with Orthogonal Transformations	Weighted model counting and integration (WMC/WMI) are natural problems to which we can reduce many probabilistic inference tasks, e.g., in Bayesian networks, Markov networks, and probabilistic programs. Typically, we are given a first-order formula, where each satisfying assignment is associated with a weight---e.g., a probability of occurrence---and our goal is to compute the total weight of the formula. In this paper, we target exact inference techniques for WMI that leverage the power of satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers to decompose a first-order formula in linear real arithmetic into a set of hyperrectangular regions whose weight is easy to compute. We demonstrate the challenges of hyperrectangular decomposition and present a novel technique that utilizes orthogonal transformations to transform formulas in order to enable efficient inference. Our evaluation demonstrates our technique's ability to improve the time required to achieve exact probability bounds.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/643	David Merrell, Aws Albarghouthi, Loris D'Antoni
Variational Mixtures of Gaussian Processes for Classification	Gaussian Processes (GPs) are powerful tools for machine learning which have been applied to both classification and regression. The mixture models of GPs were later proposed to further improve GPs for data modeling. However, these models are formulated for regression problems. In this work, we propose a new Mixture of Gaussian Processes for Classification (MGPC). Instead of the Gaussian likelihood for regression, MGPC employs the logistic function as likelihood to obtain the class probabilities, which is suitable for classification problems. The posterior distribution of latent variables is approximated through variational inference. The hyperparameters are optimized through the variational EM method and a greedy algorithm. Experiments are performed on multiple real-world datasets which show improvements over five widely used methods on predictive performance. The results also indicate that for classification MGPC is significantly better than the regression model with mixtures of GPs, different from the existing consensus that their single model counterparts are comparable.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/642	Chen Luo, Shiliang Sun
Coarse-to-Fine Lifted MAP Inference in Computer Vision	There is a vast body of theoretical research on lifted inference in probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). However, few demonstrations exist where lifting is applied in conjunction with top of the line applied algorithms. We pursue the applicability of lifted inference for computer vision (CV), with the insight that a globally optimal (MAP) labeling will likely have the same label for two symmetric pixels. The success of our approach lies in efficiently handling a distinct unary potential on every node (pixel), typical of CV applications. This allows us to lift the large class of algorithms that model a CV problem via PGM inference. We propose a generic template for coarse-to-fine (C2F) inference in CV, which progressively refines an initial coarsely lifted PGM for varying quality-time trade-offs. We demonstrate the performance of C2F inference by developing lifted versions of two near state-of-the-art CV algorithms for stereo vision and interactive image segmentation. We find that, against flat algorithms, the lifted versions have a much superior anytime performance, without any loss in final solution quality.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/641	Haroun Habeeb, Ankit Anand, Mausam, Parag Singla
Incremental Decision Making Under Risk with the Weighted Expected Utility Model	This paper deals with decision making under risk with the Weighted Expected Utility (WEU) model, which is a model generalizing expected utility and providing stronger descriptive possibilities. We address the problem of identifying, within a given set of lotteries, a (near-)optimal solution for a given decision maker consistent with the WEU theory. The WEU model is parameterized by two real-valued functions. We propose here a new incremental elicitation procedure to progressively reduce the imprecision about these functions until a robust decision can be made. We also give experimental results showing the practical efficiency of our method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/640	Hugo Gilbert, Nawal Benabbou, Patrice Perny, Olivier Spanjaard, Paolo Viappiani
Fair and Efficient Social Choice in Dynamic Settings	We study a dynamic social choice problem in which an alternative is chosen at each round according to the reported valuations of a set of agents. In the interests of obtaining a solution that is both efficient and fair, we aim to maximize the long-term Nash social welfare, which is the product of all agents' utilities. We present and analyze two greedy algorithms for this problem, including the classic Proportional Fair (PF) algorithm. We analyze several versions of the algorithms and how they relate, and provide an axiomatization of PF. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms on data gathered from a computer systems application.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/639	Rupert Freeman, Seyed Majid Zahedi, Vincent Conitzer
COG-DICE: An Algorithm for Solving Continuous-Observation Dec-POMDPs	The decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) is a powerful model for representing multi-agent problems with decentralized behavior. Unfortunately, current Dec-POMDP solution methods cannot solve problems with continuous observations, which are common in many real-world domains. To that end, we present a framework for representing and generating Dec-POMDP policies that explicitly include continuous observations. We apply our algorithm to a novel tagging problem and an extended version of a common benchmark, where it generates policies that meet or exceed the values of equivalent discretized domains without the need for finding an adequate discretization.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/638	Madison Clark-Turner, Christopher Amato
Adaptive Elicitation of Preferences under Uncertainty in Sequential Decision Making Problems	This paper aims to introduce an adaptive preference elicitation method for interactive decision support in sequential decision problems. The Decision Maker's preferences are assumed to be representable by an additive utility, initially unknown or imperfectly known. We first study the determination of possibly optimal policies when admissible utilities are imprecisely defined by some linear constraints derived from observed preferences. Then, we introduce a new approach interleaving elicitation of utilities and backward induction to incrementally determine an optimal or near-optimal policy. We propose an interactive algorithm with performance guarantees and describe numerical experiments demonstrating the practical efficiency of our approach.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/637	Nawal Benabbou, Patrice Perny
Image Gradient-based Joint Direct Visual Odometry for Stereo Camera	Visual odometry is an important research problem for computer vision and robotics. In general, the feature-based visual odometry methods heavily rely on the accurate correspondences between local salient points, while the direct approaches could make full use of whole image and perform dense 3D reconstruction simultaneously. However, the direct visual odometry usually suffers from the drawback of getting stuck at local optimum especially with large displacement, which may lead to the inferior results. To tackle this critical problem, we propose a novel scheme for stereo odometry in this paper, which is able to improve the convergence with more accurate pose. The key of our approach is a dual Jacobian optimization that is fused into a multi-scale pyramid scheme. Moreover, we introduce a gradient-based feature representation, which enjoys the merit of being robust to illumination changes. Furthermore, a joint direct odometry approach is proposed to incorporate the information from the last frame and previous keyframes. We have conducted the experimental evaluation on the challenging KITTI odometry benchmark, whose promising results show that the proposed algorithm is very effective for stereo visual odometry.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/636	Jianke Zhu
Is My Object in This Video? Reconstruction-based Object Search in Videos	"This paper addresses the problem of video-level object instance search, which aims to retrieve the videos in the database that contain a given query object instance. Without prior knowledge about ""when"" and ""where"" an object of interest may appear in a video, determining ""whether"" a video contains the target object is computationally prohibitive, as it requires exhaustively matching the query against all possible spatial-temporal locations in each video that an object may appear. To alleviate the computational and memory cost, we propose the Reconstruction-based Object SEarch (ROSE) method.It characterizes a huge corpus of features of possible spatial-temporal locations in the video into the parameters of the reconstruction model. Since the memory cost of storing reconstruction model is much less than that of storing features of possible spatial-temporal locations in the video, the efficiency of the search is significantly boosted. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed ROSE method."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/635	Tan Yu, Jingjing Meng, Junsong Yuan
Cross-Granularity Graph Inference for Semantic Video Object Segmentation	We address semantic video object segmentation via a novel cross-granularity hierarchical graphical model to integrate tracklet and object proposal reasoning with superpixel labeling. Tracklet characterizes varying spatial-temporal relations of video object which, however, quite often suffers from sporadic local outliers. In order to acquire high-quality tracklets, we propose a transductive inference model which is capable of calibrating short-range noisy object tracklets with respect to long-range dependencies and high-level context cues. In the center of this work lies a new paradigm of semantic video object segmentation beyond modeling appearance and motion of objects locally, where the semantic label is inferred by jointly exploiting multi-scale contextual information and spatial-temporal relations of video object. We evaluate our method on two popular semantic video object segmentation benchmarks and demonstrate that it advances the state-of-the-art by achieving superior accuracy performance than other leading methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/634	Huiling Wang, Tinghuai Wang, Ke Chen, Joni-Kristian Kämäräinen
Learning to Hallucinate Face Images via Component Generation and Enhancement	We propose a two-stage method for face hallucination. First, we generate facial components of the input image using CNNs. These components represent the basic facial structures. Second, we synthesize fine-grained facial structures from high resolution training images. The details of these structures are transferred into facial components for enhancement. Therefore, we generate facial components to approximate ground truth global appearance in the first stage and enhance them through recovering details in the second stage. The experiments demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/633	Yibing Song, Jiawei Zhang, Shengfeng He, Linchao Bao, Qingxiong Yang
Fast Preprocessing for Robust Face Sketch Synthesis	Exemplar-based face sketch synthesis methods usually meet the challenging problem that input photos are captured in different lighting conditions from training photos. The critical step causing the failure is the search of similar patch candidates for an input photo patch. Conventional illumination invariant patch distances are adopted rather than directly relying on pixel intensity difference, but they will fail when local contrast within a patch changes. In this paper, we propose a fast preprocessing method named Bidirectional Luminance Remapping (BLR), which interactively adjust the lighting of training and input photos. Our method can be directly integrated into state-of-the-art exemplar-based methods to improve their robustness with ignorable computational cost	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/632	Yibing Song, Jiawei Zhang, Linchao Bao, Qingxiong Yang
Combining Models from Multiple Sources for RGB-D Scene Recognition	Depth can complement RGB with useful cues about object volumes and scene layout. However, RGB-D image datasets are still too small for directly training deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in contrast to the massive monomodal RGB datasets. Previous works in RGB-D recognition typically combine two separate networks for RGB and depth data, pretrained with a large RGB dataset and then fine tuned to the respective target RGB and depth datasets. These approaches have several limitations: 1) only use low-level filters learned from RGB data, thus not being able to exploit properly depth-specific patterns, and 2) RGB and depth features are only combined at high-levels but rarely at lower-levels. In this paper, we propose a framework that leverages both knowledge acquired from large RGB datasets together with depth-specific cues learned from the limited depth data, obtaining more effective multi-source and multi-modal representations. We propose a multi-modal combination method that selects discriminative combinations of layers from the different source models and target modalities, capturing both high-level properties of the task and intrinsic low-level properties of both modalities.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/631	Xinhang Song, Shuqiang Jiang, Luis Herranz
Maintaining Communication in Multi-Robot Tree Coverage	Area coverage is an important task for mobile robots, mainly due to its applicability in many domains, such as search and rescue. In this paper we study the problem of multi-robot coverage, in which the robots must obey a strong communication restriction: they should maintain connectivity between teammates throughout the coverage. We formally describe the Multi-Robot Connected Tree Coverage problem, and an algorithm for covering perfect N-ary trees while adhering to the communication requirement. The algorithm is analyzed theoretically, providing guarantees for coverage time by the notion of speedup factor. We enhance the theoretically-proven solution with a dripping heuristic algorithm, and show in extensive simulations that it significantly decreases the coverage time. The algorithm is then adjusted to general (not necessarily perfect) N-ary trees and additional experiments prove its efficiency. Furthermore, we show the use of our solution in a simulated officebuilding scenario. Finally, we deploy our algorithm on real robots in a real office building setting, showing efficient coverage time in practice.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/630	Mor Sinay, Noa Agmon, Oleg Maksimov, Sarit Kraus, David Peleg
Temporal Grounding Graphs for Language Understanding with Accrued Visual-Linguistic Context	A robot's ability to understand or ground natural language instructions is fundamentally tied to its knowledge about the surrounding world. We present an approach to grounding natural language utterances in the context of factual information gathered through natural-language interactions and past visual observations. A probabilistic model estimates, from a natural language utterance, the objects, relations, and actions that the utterance refers to, the objectives for future robotic actions it implies, and generates a plan to execute those actions while updating a state representation to include newly acquired knowledge from the visual-linguistic context. Grounding a command necessitates a representation for past observations and interactions; however, maintaining the full context consisting of all possible observed objects, attributes, spatial relations, actions, etc., over time is intractable. Instead, our model, Temporal Grounding Graphs, maintains a learned state representation for a belief over factual groundings, those derived from natural-language interactions, and lazily infers new groundings from visual observations using the context implied by the utterance. This work significantly expands the range of language that a robot can understand by incorporating factual knowledge and observations of its workspace into its inference about the meaning and grounding of natural-language utterances.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/629	Rohan Paul, Andrei Barbu, Sue Felshin, Boris Katz, Nicholas Roy
Salient Object Detection with Semantic Priors	Salient object detection has increasingly become a popular topic in cognitive and computational sciences, including computer vision and artificial intelligence research. In this paper, we propose integrating semantic priors into the salient object detection process. Our algorithm consists of three basic steps. Firstly, the explicit saliency map is obtained based on the semantic segmentation refined by the explicit saliency priors learned from the data. Next, the implicit saliency map is computed based on a trained model which maps the implicit saliency priors embedded into regional features with the saliency values. Finally, the explicit semantic map and the implicit map are adaptively fused to form a pixel-accurate saliency map which uniformly covers the objects of interest. We further evaluate the proposed framework on two challenging datasets, namely, ECSSD and HKUIS. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/628	Tam V. Nguyen, Luoqi Liu
Locality Preserving Matching	Seeking reliable correspondences between two feature sets is a fundamental and important task in computer vision. This paper attempts to remove mismatches from given putative image feature correspondences. To achieve the goal, an efficient approach, termed as locality preserving matching (LPM), is designed, the principle of which is to maintain the local neighborhood structures of those potential true matches. We formulate the problem into a mathematical model, and derive a closed-form solution with linearithmic time and linear space complexities. More specifically, our method can accomplish the mismatch removal from thousands of putative correspondences in only a few milliseconds. Experiments on various real image pairs for general feature matching, as well as for visual homing and image retrieval demonstrate the generality of our method for handling different types of image deformations, and it is more than two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods in the same range of or better accuracy.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/627	Jiayi Ma, Ji Zhao, Hanqi Guo, Junjun Jiang, Huabing Zhou, Yuan Gao
Dual Track Multimodal Automatic Learning through Human-Robot Interaction	Human beings are constantly improving their cognitive ability via automatic learning from the interaction with the environment. Two important aspects of automatic learning are the visual perception and knowledge acquisition. The fusion of these two aspects is vital for improving the intelligence and interaction performance of robots. Many automatic knowledge extraction and recognition methods have been widely studied. However, little work focuses on integrating automatic knowledge extraction and recognition into a unified framework to enable jointly visual perception and knowledge acquisition. To solve this problem, we propose a Dual Track Multimodal Automatic Learning (DTMAL) system, which consists of two components: Hybrid Incremental Learning (HIL) from the vision track and Multimodal Knowledge Extraction (MKE) from the knowledge track. HIL can incrementally improve recognition ability of the system by learning new object samples and new object concepts. MKE is capable of constructing and updating the multimodal knowledge items based on the recognized new objects from HIL and other knowledge by exploring the multimodal signals. The fusion of the two tracks is a mutual promotion process and jointly devote to the dual track learning. We have conducted the experiments through human-machine interaction and the experimental results validated the effectiveness of our proposed system.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/626	Shuqiang Jiang, Weiqing Min, Xue Li, Huayang Wang, Jian Sun, Jiaqi Zhou
Bridging the Gap between Observation and Decision Making: Goal Recognition and Flexible Resource Allocation in Dynamic Network Interdiction	Goal recognition, which is the task of inferring an agent's goals given some or all of the agent's observed actions, is one of the important approaches in bridging the gap between the observation and decision making within an observe-orient-decide-act cycle. Unfortunately, few researches focus on how to improve the utilization of knowledge produced by a goal recognition system. In this work, we propose a Markov Decision Process-based goal recognition approach tailored to a dynamic shortest-path local network interdiction (DSPLNI) problem. We first introduce a novel DSPLNI model and its solvable dual form so as to incorporate real-time knowledge acquired from goal recognition system. Then a Markov Decision Process-based goal recognition model along with its dynamic Bayesian network representation and the applied goal inference method is proposed to identify the evader's real goal within the DSPLNI context. Based on that, we further propose an efficient scalable technique in maintaining action utility map used in fast goal inference, and develop a flexible resource assignment mechanism in DSPLNI using knowledge from goal recognition system. Experimental results show the effectiveness and accuracy of our methods both in goal recognition and dynamic network interdiction.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/625	Kai Xu, Kaiming Xiao, Quanjun Yin, Yabing Zha, Cheng Zhu
A Scalable Approach to Chasing Multiple Moving Targets with Multiple Agents	Chasing multiple mobile targets with multiple agents is important in several applications, such as computer games and police chasing scenarios. Existing approaches can compute optimal policies. However, they have a limited scalability, as they implement expensive minimax searches. We introduce a sub-optimal but scalable approach that assigns individual agents to individual targets and that can dynamically re-compute such assignments. We provide a theoretical analysis, including upper bounds on the number of time steps required to solve an instance. In a detailed empirical evaluation on grid maps, our algorithm scales up very convincingly beyond the limits of previous methods. On small problems, where a comparison to a minimax approach is possible, the results demonstrate a good solution quality for our method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/624	Fan Xie, Adi Botea, Akihiro Kishimoto
Hierarchical Task Network Planning with Task Insertion and State Constraints	We extend hierarchical task network planning with task insertion (TIHTN) by introducing state constraints, called TIHTNS. We show that just as for TIHTN planning, all solutions of the TIHTNS planning problem can be obtained by acyclic decomposition and task insertion, entailing that its plan-existence problem is decidable without any restriction on decomposition methods. We also prove that the extension by state constraints does not increase the complexity of the plan-existence problem, which stays 2-NEXPTIME-complete, based on an acyclic progression operator. In addition, we show that TIHTNS planning covers not only the original TIHTN planning but also hierarchy-relaxed hierarchical goal network planning.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/623	Zhanhao Xiao, Andreas Herzig, Laurent Perrussel, Hai Wan, Xiaoheng Su
New Metrics and Algorithms for Stochastic Goal Recognition Design Problems	Goal Recognition Design (GRD) problems involve identifying the best ways to modify the underlying environment that agents operate in, typically by making a subset of feasible actions infeasible, in such a way that agents are forced to reveal their goals as early as possible. The Stochastic GRD (S-GRD) model is an important extension that introduced stochasticity to the outcome of agent actions. Unfortunately, the worst-case distinctiveness (wcd) metric proposed for S-GRDs has a formal definition that is inconsistent with its intuitive definition, which is the maximal number of actions an agent can take, in the expectation, before its goal is revealed. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (1) We propose a new wcd metric, called all-goals wcd (wcdag), that remedies this inconsistency; (2) We introduce a new metric, called expected-case distinctiveness (ecd), that weighs the possible goals based on their importance; (3) We provide theoretical results comparing these different metrics as well as the complexity of computing them optimally; and (4) We describe new efficient algorithms to compute the wcdag and ecd values.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/622	Christabel Wayllace, Ping Hou, William Yeoh
Heuristic Online Goal Recognition in Continuous Domains	Goal recognition is the problem of inferring the goal of an agent, based on its observed actions. An inspiring approach—plan recognition by planning (PRP)—uses off-the-shelf planners to dynamically generate plans for given goals, eliminating the need for the traditional plan library. However, existing PRP formulation is inherently inefficient in online recognition, and cannot be used with motion planners for continuous spaces. In this paper, we utilize a different PRP formulation which allows for online goal recognition, and for application in continuous spaces. We present an online recognition algorithm, where two heuristic decision points may be used to improve run-time significantly over existing work. We specify heuristics for continuous domains, prove guarantees on their use, and empirically evaluate the algorithm over hundreds of experiments in both a 3D navigational environment and a cooperative robotic team task.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/621	Mor Vered, Gal A.

Temporal Planning for Compilation of Quantum Approximate Optimization Circuits	We investigate the application of temporal planners to the problem of compiling quantum circuits to emerging quantum hardware. While our approach is general, we focus our initial experiments on Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) circuits that have few ordering constraints and thus allow highly parallel plans. We report on experiments using several temporal planners to compile circuits of various sizes to a realistic hardware architecture. This early empirical evaluation suggests that temporal planning is a viable approach to quantum circuit compilation.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/620	Davide Venturelli, Minh Do, Eleanor Rieffel, Jeremy Frank
Mechanism Design for Strategic Project Scheduling	Organizing large scale projects (e.g., Conferences, IT Shows, F1 race) requires precise scheduling of multiple dependent tasks on common resources where multiple selfish entities are competing to execute the individual tasks. In this paper, we consider a well studied and rich scheduling model referred to as RCPSP (Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem). The key change to this model that we consider in this paper is the presence of selfish entities competing to perform individual tasks with the aim of maximizing their own utility. Due to the selfish entities in play, the goal of the scheduling problem is no longer only to minimize makespan for the entire project, but rather, to maximize social welfare while ensuring incentive compatibility and economic efficiency. We show that traditional VCG mechanism is not incentive compatible in this context and hence we provide two new practical mechanisms that extend on VCG. These new mechanisms referred to as Individual Completion based Payments (ICP) and Social Completion based Payments (SCP) provide strong theoretical properties including strategy proofness.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/619	Pradeep Varakantham, Na Fu
From Qualitative to Quantitative Dominance Pruning for Optimal Planning	Dominance relations compare states to determine whether one is at least as good as another in terms of their goal distance. We generalize these qualitative yes/no relations to functions that measure by how much a state is better than another. This allows us to distinguish cases where the state is strictly closer to the goal. Moreover, we may obtain a bound on the difference in goal distance between two states even if there is no qualitative dominance.We analyze the multiple advantages that quantitative dominance has, like discovering coarser dominance relations, or trading dominance by g-value. Moreover, quantitative dominance can also be used to prove that an action starts an optimal plan from a given state. We introduce a novel action selection pruning that uses this to prune any other successor. Results show that quantitative dominance pruning greatly reduces the search space, significantly increasing the planners' performance.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/618	Álvaro Torralba
Robust Advertisement Allocation	With the rapid growth of e-commerce and World Wide Web, internet advertising revenue has surpassed broadcast revenue very recently. As online advertising has become a major source of revenue for online publishers, such as Google and Amazon, one problem facing them is to optimize the ads selection and allocation in order to maximize their revenue. Although there is a rich body of work that has been devoted to this field, uncertainty about models and parameter settings is largely ignored in existing algorithm design. To fill this gap, we are the first to formulate and study the \emph{Robust Ad Allocation} problem, by taking into account the uncertainty about parameter settings. We define a Robust Ad Allocation framework with a set of candidate parameter settings, typically derived from different users or topics. Our main aim is to develop robust ad allocation algorithms, which can provide satisfactory performance across a spectrum of parameter settings, compared to the (parameter-specific) optimum solutions. We study this problem progressively and propose a series of algorithms with bounded approximation ratio.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/617	Shaojie Tang
An Improved Approximation Algorithm for the Subpath Planning Problem and Its Generalization	This paper focuses on a generalization of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), called the subpath planning problem (SPP). Given 2n vertices and n independent edges on a metric space, we aim to find a shortest tour that contains all the edges. SPP is one of the fundamental problems in both artificial intelligence and robotics. Our main result is to design a 1.5-approximation algorithm that runs in polynomial time, improving the currently best approximation algorithm. The idea is direct use of techniques developed for TSP. In addition, we propose a generalization of SPP called the subgroup planning problem (SGPP). In this problem, we are given a set of disjoint groups of vertices, and we aim to find a shortest tour such that all the vertices in each group are traversed sequentially. We propose a 3-approximation algorithm for SGPP. We also conduct numerical experiments. Compared with previous algorithms, our algorithms improve the solution quality by more than 10% for large instances with more than 10,000 vertices.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/616	Hanna Sumita, Yuma Yonebayashi, Naonori Kakimura, Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi
Efficient, Safe, and Probably Approximately Complete Learning of Action Models	In this paper we explore the theoretical boundaries of planning in a setting where no model of the agent's actions is given. Instead of an action model, a set of successfully executed plans are given and the task is to generate a plan that is safe, i.e., guaranteed to achieve the goal without failing. To this end, we show how to learn a conservative model of the world in which actions are guaranteed to be applicable. This conservative model is then given to an off-the-shelf classical planner, resulting in a plan that is guaranteed to achieve the goal. However, this reduction from a model-free planning to a model-based planning is not complete: in some cases a plan will not be found even when such exists. We analyze the relation between the number of observed plans and the likelihood that our conservative approach will indeed fail to solve a solvable problem. Our analysis show that the number of trajectories needed scales gracefully.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/615	Roni Stern, Brendan Juba
Search and Learn: On Dead-End Detectors, the Traps they Set, and Trap Learning	A key technique for proving unsolvability in classical planning are dead-end detectors \Delta: effectively testable criteria sufficient for unsolvability, pruning (some) unsolvable states during search. Related to this, a recent proposal is the identification of traps prior to search, compact representations of non-goal state sets T that cannot be escaped. Here, we create new synergy across these ideas. We define a generalized concept of traps, relative to a given dead-end detector \Delta, where T can be escaped, but only into dead-end states detected by \Delta. We show how to learn compact representations of such T during search, extending the reach of \Delta. Our experiments show that this can be quite beneficial. It improves coverage for many unsolvable benchmark planning domains and dead-end detectors \Delta, in particular on resource-constrained domains where it outperforms the state of the art.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/614	Marcel Steinmetz, Jörg Hoffmann
Generating Context-Free Grammars using Classical Planning	This paper presents a novel approach for generating Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) from small sets of input strings (a single input string in some cases). Our approach is to compile this task into a classical planning problem whose solutions are sequences of actions that build and validate a CFG compliant with the input strings. In addition, we show that our compilation is suitable for implementing the two canonical tasks for CFGs, string production and string recognition.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/613	Javier Segovia-Aguas, Sergio Jiménez, Anders Jonsson
Landmarks for Numeric Planning Problems	The paper generalises the notion of landmarks for reasoning about planning problems involving propositional and numeric variables. Intuitively, numeric landmarks are regions in the metric space defined by the problem whose crossing is necessary for its resolution. The paper proposes a relaxation-based method for their automated extraction directly from the problem structure, and shows how to exploit them to infer what we call disjunctive and additive hybrid action landmarks. The justification of such a disjunctive representation results from the intertwined propositional and numeric structure of the problem. The paper exercises their use in two novel admissible LP-Based numeric heuristics, and reports experiments on cost-optimal numeric planning problems. Results show the heuristics are more informed and effective than previous work for problems involving a higher number of (sub)goals.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/612	Enrico Scala, Patrik Haslum, Daniele Magazzeni, Sylvie Thiébaux
Lossy Compression of Pattern Databases Using Acyclic Random Hypergraphs	A domain-independent heuristic function created by an abstraction is usually implemented using a Pattern Database (PDB), which is a lookup table of (abstract state, heuristic value) pairs. PDBs containing high quality heuristic values generally require substantial memory space and therefore need to be compressed. In this paper, we introduce Acyclic Random Hypergraph Compression (ARHC), a domain-independent approach to compressing PDBs using acyclic random r-partite r-uniform hypergraphs. The ARHC algorithm, which comes in Base and Extended versions, provides fast lookup and a high compression rate. ARHC-Extended achieves higher quality heuristics than ARHC-Base by decreasing the heuristic information loss at the cost of some decrease in the compression rate. ARHC shows higher performance than level-by-level Bloom filter PDB compression in all experiments conducted so far.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/611	Mehdi Sadeqi, Howard J. Hamilton
Deceptive Path-Planning	Deceptive path-planning involves finding a path such that the probability of an observer identifying the path's final destination - before it has been reached - is minimised. This paper formalises deception as it applies to path-planning and introduces the notion of a last deceptive point (LDP) which, when measured in terms of 'path completion', can be used to rank paths by their potential to deceive. Building on recent developments in probabilistic goal-recognition, we propose a formula to calculate an optimal LDP and present strategies for the generation of deceptive paths by both simulation ('showing the false') and dissimulation ('hiding the real').	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/610	Peta Masters, Sebastian Sardina
Integrating Answer Set Programming with Semantic Dictionaries for Robot Task Planning	In this paper, we propose a novel integrated task planning system for service robot in domestic domains. Given open-ended high-level user instructions in natural language, robots need to generate a plan, i.e., a sequence of low-level executable actions, to complete the required tasks. To address this, we exploit the knowledge on semantic roles of common verbs defined in semantic dictionaries such as FrameNet and integrate it with Answer Set Programming --- a task planning framework with both representation language and solvers. In the experiments, we evaluated our approach using common benchmarks on service tasks and showed that it can successfully handle much more tasks than the state-of-the-art solution. Notably, we deployed the proposed planning system on our service robot for the annual RoboCup@Home competitions and achieved very encouraging results.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/609	Dongcai Lu, Yi Zhou, Feng Wu, Zhao Zhang, Xiaoping Chen
Equi-Reward Utility Maximizing Design in Stochastic Environments	We present the Equi Reward Utility Maximizing Design (ER-UMD) problem for redesigning stochastic environments to maximize agent performance. ER-UMD fits well contemporary applications that require offline design of environments where robots and humans act and cooperate. To find an optimal modification sequence we present two novel solution techniques: a compilation that embeds design into a planning problem, allowing use of off-the-shelf solvers to find a solution, and a heuristic search in the modifications space, for which we present an admissible heuristic. Evaluation shows the feasibility of the approach using standard benchmarks from the probabilistic planning competition and a benchmark we created for a vacuum cleaning robot setting.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/608	Sarah Keren, Luis Pineda, Avigdor Gal, Erez Karpas, Shlomo Zilberstein
Factorized Asymptotic Bayesian Policy Search for POMDPs	This paper proposes a novel direct policy search (DPS) method with model selection for partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs). DPSs have been standard for learning POMDPs due to their computational efficiency and natural ability to maximize total rewards. An important open challenge for the best use of DPS methods is model selection, i.e., determination of the proper dimensionality of hidden states and complexity of policy functions, to mitigate overfitting in highly-flexible model representations of POMDPs. This paper bridges Bayesian inference and reward maximization and derives marginalized weighted log-likelihood~(MWL) for POMDPs which takes both advantages of Bayesian model selection and DPS. Then we propose factorized asymptotic Bayesian policy search (FABPS) to explore the model and the policy which maximizes MWL by expanding recently-developed factorized asymptotic Bayesian inference. Experimental results show that FABPS outperforms state-of-the-art model selection methods for POMDPs, with respect both to model selection and to expected total rewards.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/607	Masaaki Imaizumi, Ryohei Fujimaki
Numeric Planning via Abstraction and Policy Guided Search	The real-world application of planning techniques often requires models with numeric fluents. However, these fluents are not directly supported by most planners and heuristics. We describe a family of planning algorithms that takes a numeric planning problem and produces an abstracted representation that can be solved using any classical planner. The resulting abstract plan is generalized into a policy and then used to guide the search in the original numeric domain. We prove that our approach is sound, and we evaluate it on a set of standard benchmarks. We show that it can provide competitive performance when compared to other well-known algorithms for numeric planning, and a significant performance improvement in certain domains.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/606	León Illanes, Sheila A.

Switched Linear Multi-Robot Navigation Using Hierarchical Model Predictive Control	Multi-robot navigation control in the absence of reference trajectory is rather challenging as it is expected to ensure stability and feasibility while still offer fast computation on control decisions. The intrinsic high complexity of switched linear dynamical robots makes the problem even more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel HMPC based method to address the navigation problem of multiple robots with switched linear dynamics. We develop a new technique to compute the reachable sets of switched linear systems and use them to enable the parallel computation of control parameters. We present theoretical results on stability, feasibility and complexity of the proposed approach, and demonstrate its empirical advance in performance against other approaches.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/605	Chao Huang, Xin Chen, Yifan Zhang, Shengchao Qin, Yifeng Zeng, Xuandong Li
Softpressure: A Schedule-Driven Backpressure Algorithm for Coping with Network Congestion	We consider the problem of minimizing the the delay of jobs moving through a directed graph of service nodes. In this problem, each node may have several links and is constrained to serve one link at a time. As jobs move through the network, they can pass through a node only after they have been serviced by that node. The objective is to minimize the delay jobs incur sitting on queues waiting to be serviced. Two popular approaches to this problem are backpressure algorithm and schedule-driven control. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach of those two methods that incorporates the stability of queuing theory into the schedule-driven control. We then demonstrate how this hybrid method outperforms the other two in a real-time traffic signal control problem, where the nodes are traffic lights, the links are roads, and the jobs are vehicles. We show through simulations that, in scenarios with heavy congestion, the hybrid method results in 50% and 15% reductions in delay over schedule-driven control and backpressure respectively. A theoretical analysis also justifies our results.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/604	Hsu-Chieh Hu, Stephen F. Smith
Intelligent Belief State Sampling for Conformant Planning	We propose a new method for conformant planning based on two ideas. First given a small sample of the initial belief state we reduce conformant planning for this sample to a classical planning problem, giving us a candidate solution. Second we exploit regression as a way to compactly represent necessary conditions for such a solution to be valid for the non-deterministic setting. If necessary, we use the resulting formula to extract a counter-example to populate our next sampling. Our experiments show that this approach is competitive on a class of problems that are hard for traditional planners, and also returns generally shorter plans. We are also able to demonstrate unsatisfiability of some problems.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/603	Alban Grastien, Enrico Scala
Beyond Forks: Finding and Ranking Star Factorings for Decoupled Search	Star-topology decoupling is a recent search reduction method for forward state space search. The idea basically is to automatically identify a star factoring, then search only over the center component in the star, avoiding interleavings across leaf components. The framework can handle complex star topologies, yet prior work on decoupled search considered only factoring strategies identifying fork and inverted-fork topologies. Here, we introduce factoring strategies able to detect general star topologies, thereby extending the reach of decoupled search to new factorings and to new domains, sometimes resulting in significant performance improvements. Furthermore, we introduce a predictive portfolio method that reliably selects the most suitable factoring for a given planning task, leading to superior overall performance.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/602	Daniel Gnad, Valerie Poser, Jörg Hoffmann
On Creating Complementary Pattern Databases	A pattern database (PDB) for a planning task is a heuristic function in the form of a lookup table that contains optimal solution costs of a simplified version of the task. In this paper we introduce a method that sequentially creates multiple PDBs which are later combined into a single heuristic function. At a given iteration, our method uses estimates of the A* running time to create a PDB that complements the strengths of the PDBs created in previous iterations. We evaluate our algorithm using explicit and symbolic PDBs. Our results show that the heuristics produced by our approach are able to outperform existing schemes, and that our method is able to create PDBs that complement the strengths of other existing heuristics such as a symbolic perimeter heuristic.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/601	Santiago Franco, Álvaro Torralba, Levi H.

Purely Declarative Action Descriptions are Overrated: Classical Planning with Simulators	Classical planning is concerned with problems where a goal needs to be reached from a known initial state by doing actions with deterministic, known effects. Classical planners, however, deal only with classical problems that can be expressed in declarative planning languages such as STRIPS or PDDL. This prevents their use on problems that are not easy to model declaratively or whose dynamics are given via simulations. Simulators do not provide a declarative representation of actions, but simply return successor states. The question we address in this paper is: can a planner that has access to the structure of states and goals only, approach the performance of planners that also have access to the structure of actions expressed in PDDL? To answer this, we develop domain-independent, black box planning algorithms that completely ignore action structure, and show that they match the performance of state-of-the-art classical planners on the standard planning benchmarks. Effective black box algorithms open up new possibilities for modeling and for expressing control knowledge, which we also illustrate.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/600	Guillem Francès, Miquel Ramírez, Nir Lipovetzky, Hector Geffner
Additive Merge-and-Shrink Heuristics for Diverse Action Costs	In many planning applications, actions can have highly diverse costs. Recent studies focus on the effects of diverse action costs on search algorithms, but not on their effects on domain-independent heuristics. In this paper, we demonstrate there are negative impacts of action cost diversity on merge-and-shrink (M&S), a successful abstraction method for producing high-quality heuristics for planning problems. We propose a new cost partitioning method for M&S to address the negative effects of diverse action costs. We investigate non-unit cost IPC domains, especially those for which diverse action costs have severe negative effects on the quality of the M&S heuristic. Our experiments demonstrate that in these domains, an additive set of M&S heuristics using the new cost partitioning method produces much more informative and effective heuristics than creating a single M&S heuristic which directly encodes diverse costs.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/599	Gaojian Fan, Martin Müller, Robert Holte
Faster Conflict Generation for Dynamic Controllability	In this paper, we focus on speeding up the temporal plan relaxation problem for dynamically controllable systems. We take a look at the current best-known algorithm for determining dynamic controllability and augment it to efficiently generate conflicts when the network is deemed uncontrollable. Our work preserves the O(n^3) runtime of the best available dynamic controllability checker and improves on the previous best runtime of O(n^4) for extracting dynamic controllability conflicts. We then turn our attention to temporal plan relaxation tasks and show how we can leverage our work on conflicts and the structure of the network to efficiently make incremental updates intended to restore dynamic controllability by relaxing constraints. Our new algorithm, RelaxIDC, has the same asymptotic runtime as previous algorithms but sees dramatic empirical improvements over the course of repeated dynamic controllability checks.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/598	Nikhil Bhargava, Tiago Vaquero, Brian Williams
Reduction Techniques for Model Checking and Learning in MDPs	Omega-regular objectives in Markov decision processes (MDPs) reduce to reachability: find a policy which maximizes the probability of reaching a target set of states. Given an MDP, an initial distribution, and a target set of states, such a policy can be computed by most probabilistic model checking tools. If the MDP is only partially specified, i.e., some prob- abilities are unknown, then model-learning techniques can be used to statistically approximate the probabilities and enable the computation of the de- sired policy. For fully specified MDPs, reducing the size of the MDP translates into faster model checking; for partially specified MDPs, into faster learning. We provide reduction techniques that al- low us to remove irrelevant transition probabilities: transition probabilities (known, or to be learned) that do not influence the maximal reachability probability. Among other applications, these reductions can be seen as a pre-processing of MDPs before model checking or as a way to reduce the number of experiments required to obtain a good approximation of an unknown MDP.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/597	Suda Bharadwaj, Stephane Le Roux, Guillermo Perez, Ufuk Topcu
Efficient Optimal Search under Expensive Edge Cost Computation	Optimal heuristic search has been successful in many domains, including journey planning, route planning and puzzle solving. Existing work typically assumes that the cost of each action can easily be obtained. However, in many problems, the exact edge cost is expensive to compute. Existing search algorithms face a significant performance bottleneck, due to an excessive overhead associated with dynamically calculating exact edge costs. We present DEA*, an algorithm for problems with expensive edge cost computations. DEA* combines heuristic edge cost evaluations with delayed node expansions, reducing the number of exact edge computations. We formally prove that DEA* is optimal and it is efficient with respect to the number of exact edge cost computations. We empirically evaluate DEA* on multiple-worker routing problems where the exact edge cost is calculated by invoking an external multi-modal journey planning engine. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our ideas in reducing the computational time and improving the solving ability. In addition, we show the advantages of DEA* in domain-independent planning, where we simulate that accurate edge costs are expensive to compute.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/596	Masataro Asai, Akihiro Kishimoto, Adi Botea, Radu Marinescu, Elizabeth M.

Iterative Entity Alignment via Joint Knowledge Embeddings	Entity alignment aims to link entities and their counterparts among multiple knowledge graphs (KGs). Most existing methods typically rely on external information of entities such as Wikipedia links and require costly manual feature construction to complete alignment. In this paper, we present a novel approach for entity alignment via joint knowledge embeddings. Our method jointly encodes both entities and relations of various KGs into a unified low-dimensional semantic space according to a small seed set of aligned entities. During this process, we can align entities according to their semantic distance in this joint semantic space. More specifically, we present an iterative and parameter sharing method to improve alignment performance. Experiment results on real-world datasets show that, as compared to baselines, our method achieves significant improvements on entity alignment, and can further improve knowledge graph completion performance on various KGs with the favor of joint knowledge embeddings.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/595	Hao Zhu, Ruobing Xie, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun
Maximum Expected Likelihood Estimation for Zero-resource Neural Machine Translation	While neural machine translation (NMT) has made remarkable progress in translating a handful of high-resource language pairs recently, parallel corpora are not always available for many zero-resource language pairs. To deal with this problem, we propose an approach to zero-resource NMT via maximum expected likelihood estimation. The basic idea is to maximize the expectation with respect to a pivot-to-source translation model for the intended source-to-target model on a pivot-target parallel corpus. To approximate the expectation, we propose two methods to connect the pivot-to-source and source-to-target models. Experiments on two zero-resource language pairs show that the proposed approach yields substantial gains over baseline methods. We also observe that when trained jointly with the source-to-target model, the pivot-to-source translation model also obtains improvements over independent training.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/594	Hao Zheng, Yong Cheng, Yang Liu
Entity Suggestion with Conceptual Expanation	Entity Suggestion with Conceptual Explanation (ESC) refers to a type of entity acquisition query in which a user provides a set of example entities as the query and obtains in return not only some related entities but also concepts which can best explain the query and the result. ESC is useful in many applications such as related-entity recommendation and query expansion. Many example based entity suggestion solutions are available in existing literatures. However, they are generally not aware of the concepts of query entities thus cannot be used for conceptual explanation. In this paper, we propose two probabilistic entity suggestion models and their computation solutions. Our models and solutions fully take advantage of the large scale taxonomies which consist of isA relations between entities and concepts. With our models and solutions, we can not only find the best entities to suggest but also derive the best concepts to explain the suggestion. Extensive evaluations on real data sets justify the accuracy of our models and the efficiency of our solutions.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/593	Yi Zhang, Yanghua Xiao, Seung-won Hwang, Haixun Wang, X.

Automatic Generation of Grounded Visual Questions	In this paper, we propose the first model to be able to generate visually grounded questions with diverse types for a single image. Visual question generation is an emerging topic which aims to ask questions in natural language based on visual input. To the best of our knowledge, it lacks automatic methods to generate meaningful questions with various types for the same visual input. To circumvent the problem, we propose a model that automatically generates visually grounded questions with varying types. Our model takes as input both images and the captions generated by a dense caption model, samples the most probable question types, and generates the questions in sequel. The experimental results on two real world datasets show that our model outperforms the strongest baseline in terms of both correctness and diversity with a wide margin.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/592	Shijie Zhang, Lizhen Qu, Shaodi You, Zhenglu Yang, Jiawan Zhang
Segmenting Chinese Microtext: Joint Informal-Word Detection and Segmentation with Neural Networks	State-of-the-art Chinese word segmentation systems typically exploit supervised modelstrained on a standard manually-annotated corpus,achieving performances over 95% on a similar standard testing corpus.However, the performances may drop significantly when the same models are applied onto Chinese microtext.One major challenge is the issue of informal words in the microtext.Previous studies show that informal word detection can be helpful for microtext processing.In this work, we investigate it under the neural setting, by proposing a joint segmentation model that integrates the detection of informal words simultaneously.In addition, we generate training corpus for the joint model by using existing corpus automatically.Experimental results show that the proposed model is highly effective for segmentation of Chinese microtext.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/591	Meishan Zhang, Guohong Fu, Nan Yu
AGRA: An Analysis-Generation-Ranking Framework for Automatic Abbreviation from Paper Titles	People sometimes choose word-like abbreviations to refer to items with a long description. These abbreviations usually come from the descriptive text of the item and are easy to remember and pronounce, while preserving the key idea of the item. Coming up with a nice abbreviation is not an easy job, even for human. Previous assistant naming systems compose names by applying hand-written rules, which may not perform well. In this paper, we propose to view the naming task as an artificial intelligence problem and create a data set in the domain of academic naming. To generate more delicate names, we propose a three-step framework, including description analysis, candidate generation and abbreviation ranking, each of which is parameterized and optimizable. We conduct experiments to compare different settings of our framework with several analysis approaches from different perspectives. Compared to online or baseline systems, our framework could achieve the best results.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/590	Jianbing Zhang, Yixin Sun, Shujian Huang, Cam-Tu Nguyen, Xiaoliang Wang, Xinyu Dai, Jiajun Chen, Yang Yu
Learning Conversational Systems that Interleave Task and Non-Task Content	Task-oriented dialog systems have been applied in various tasks, such as automated personal assistants, customer service providers and tutors. These systems work well when users have clear and explicit intentions that are well-aligned to the systems' capabilities. However, they fail if users intentions are not explicit.To address this shortcoming, we propose a framework to interleave non-task content (i.e.everyday social conversation) into task conversations. When the task content fails, the system can still keep the user engaged with the non-task content. We trained a policy using reinforcement learning algorithms to promote long-turn conversation coherence and consistency, so that the system can have smooth transitions between task and non-task content.To test the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we developed a movie promotion dialog system. Experiments with human users indicate that a system that interleaves social and task content achieves a better task success rate and is also rated as more engaging compared to a pure task-oriented system.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/589	Zhou Yu, Alexander Rudnicky, Alan Black
A Correlated Topic Model Using Word Embeddings	Conventional correlated topic models are able to capture correlation structure among latent topics by replacing the Dirichlet prior with the logistic normal distribution. Word embeddings have been proven to be able to capture semantic regularities in language. Therefore, the semantic relatedness and correlations between words can be directly calculated in the word embedding space, for example, via cosine values. In this paper, we propose a novel correlated topic model using word embeddings. The proposed model enables us to exploit the additional word-level correlation information in word embeddings and directly model topic correlation in the continuous word embedding space. In the model, words in documents are replaced with meaningful word embeddings, topics are modeled as multivariate Gaussian distributions over the word embeddings and topic correlations are learned among the continuous Gaussian topics. A Gibbs sampling solution with data augmentation is given to perform inference. We evaluate our model on the 20 Newsgroups dataset and the Reuters-21578 dataset qualitatively and quantitatively. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed model.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/588	Guangxu Xun, Yaliang Li, Wayne Xin Zhao, Jing Gao, Aidong Zhang
Lexical Sememe Prediction via Word Embeddings and Matrix Factorization	Sememes are defined as the minimum semantic units of human languages. People have manually annotated lexical sememes for words and form linguistic knowledge bases. However, manual construction is time-consuming and labor-intensive, with significant annotation inconsistency and noise. In this paper, we for the first time explore to automatically predict lexical sememes based on semantic meanings of words encoded by word embeddings. Moreover, we apply matrix factorization to learn semantic relations between sememes and words. In experiments, we take a real-world sememe knowledge base HowNet for training and evaluation, and the results reveal the effectiveness of our method for lexical sememe prediction. Our method will be of great use for annotation verification of existing noisy sememe knowledge bases and annotation suggestion of new words and phrases.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/587	Ruobing Xie, Xingchi Yuan, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun
Fast Parallel Training of Neural Language Models	Training neural language models (NLMs) is very time consuming and we need parallelization for system speedup. However, standard training methods have poor scalability across multiple devices (e.g., GPUs) due to the huge time cost required to transmit data for gradient sharing in the back-propagation process. In this paper we present a sampling-based approach to reducing data transmission for better scaling of NLMs. As a ''bonus'', the resulting model also improves the training speed on a single device. Our approach yields significant speed improvements on a recurrent neural network-based language model. On four NVIDIA GTX1080 GPUs, it achieves a speedup of 2.1+ times over the standard asynchronous stochastic gradient descent baseline, yet with no increase in perplexity. This is even 4.2 times faster than the naive single GPU counterpart.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/586	Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu, Tongran Liu, Chunliang Zhang
Symbolic Priors for RNN-based Semantic Parsing	"Seq2seq models based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have recently received a lot of attention in the domain of Semantic Parsing. While in principle they can be trained directly on pairs (natural language utterances, logical forms), their performance is limited by the amount of available data. To alleviate this problem, we propose to exploit various sources of prior knowledge: the well-formedness of the logical forms is modeled by a weighted context-free grammar; the likelihood that certain entities present in the input utterance are also present in the logical form is modeled by weighted finite-state automata. The grammar and automata are combined together through an efficient intersection algorithm to form a soft guide (""background"") to the RNN.We test our method on an extension of the Overnight dataset and show that it not only strongly improves over an RNN baseline, but also outperforms non-RNN models based on rich sets of hand-crafted features."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/585	Chunyang Xiao, Marc Dymetman, Claire Gardent
Improved Neural Machine Translation with Source Syntax	Neural Machine Translation (NMT) based on the encoder-decoder architecture has recently achieved the state-of-the-art performance. Researchers have proven that extending word level attention to phrase level attention by incorporating source-side phrase structure can enhance the attention model and achieve promising improvement. However, word dependencies that can be crucial to correctly understand a source sentence are not always in a consecutive fashion (i.e. phrase structure), sometimes they can be in long distance. Phrase structures are not the best way to explicitly model long distance dependencies. In this paper we propose a simple but effective method to incorporate source-side long distance dependencies into NMT. Our method based on dependency trees enriches each source state with global dependency structures, which can better capture the inherent syntactic structure of source sentences. Experiments on Chinese-English and English-Japanese translation tasks show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art SMT and NMT baselines.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/584	Shuangzhi Wu, Ming Zhou, Dongdong Zhang
Learning to Identify Ambiguous and Misleading News Headlines	Accuracy is one of the basic principles of journalism. However, it is increasingly hard to manage due to the diversity of news media. Some editors of online news tend to use catchy headlines which trick readers into clicking. These headlines are either ambiguous or misleading, degrading the reading experience of the audience. Thus, identifying inaccurate news headlines is a task worth studying. Previous work names these headlines ``clickbaits'' and mainly focus on the features extracted from the headlines, which limits the performance since the consistency between headlines and news bodies is underappreciated. In this paper, we clearly redefine the problem and identify ambiguous and misleading headlines separately. We utilize class sequential rules to exploit structure information when detecting ambiguous headlines. For the identification of misleading headlines, we extract features based on the congruence between headlines and bodies. To make use of the large unlabeled data set, we apply a co-training method and gain an increase in performance. The experiment results show the effectiveness of our methods. Then we use our classifiers to detect inaccurate headlines crawled from different sources and conduct a data analysis.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/583	Wei Wei, Xiaojun Wan
A Variational Autoencoding Approach for Inducing Cross-lingual Word Embeddings	Cross-language learning allows one to use training data from one language to build models for another language. Many traditional approaches require word-level alignment sentences from parallel corpora, in this paper we define a general bilingual training objective function requiring sentence level parallel corpus only. We propose a variational autoencoding approach for training bilingual word embeddings. The variational model introduces a continuous latent variable to explicitly model the underlying semantics of the parallel sentence pairs and to guide the generation of the sentence pairs. Our model restricts the bilingual word embeddings to represent words in exactly the same continuous vector space. Empirical results on the task of cross lingual document classification has shown that our method is effective.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/582	Liangchen Wei, Zhi-Hong Deng
A Neural Model for Joint Event Detection and Summarization	Twitter new event detection aims to identify first stories in a tweet stream. Typical approaches consider two sub tasks. First, it is necessary to filter out mundane or irrelevant tweets. Second, tweets are grouped automatically into event clusters. Traditionally, these two sub tasks are processed separately, and integrated under a pipeline setting, despite that there is inter-dependence between the two tasks. In addition, one further related task is summarization, which is to extract a succinct summary for representing a large group of tweets. Summarization is related to detection, under the new event setting in that salient information is universal between event representing tweets and informative event summaries. In this paper, we build a joint model to filter, cluster, and summarize the tweets for new events. In particular, deep representation learning is used to vectorize tweets, which serves as basis that connects tasks. A neural stacking model is used for integrating a pipeline of different sub tasks, and for better sharing between the predecessor and successors. Experiments show that our proposed neural joint model is more effective compared to its pipeline baseline.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/581	Zhongqing Wang, Yue Zhang
DDoS Event Forecasting using Twitter Data	Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have been significant threats to the Internet. Traditional research in cyber security focuses on detecting emerging DDoS attacks by tracing network package flow. A characteristic of DDoS defense is that rescue time is limited since the launch of attack. More resilient detection and defence models are typically more costly. We aim at predicting the likelihood of DDoS attacks by monitoring relevant text streams in social media, so that the level of defense can be adjusted dynamically for maximizing cost-effect. To our knowledge, this is a novel and challenge research question for DDoS rescue. Because the input of this task is a text stream rather than a document, information should be collected both on the textual content of individual posts. We propose a fine-grained hierarchical stream model to capture semantic information over infinitely long history, and reveal burstiness and trends. Empirical evaluation shows that social text streams are indeed informative for DDoS forecasting, and our proposed hierarchical model is more effective compared to strong baseline text stream models and discrete bag-of-words models.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/580	Zhongqing Wang, Yue Zhang
Bilateral Multi-Perspective Matching for Natural Language Sentences	Natural language sentence matching is a fundamental technology for a variety of tasks. Previous approaches either match sentences from a single direction or only apply single granular (word-by-word or sentence-by-sentence) matching. In this work, we propose a bilateral multi-perspective matching (BiMPM) model. Given two sentences P and Q, our model first encodes them with a BiLSTM encoder. Next, we match the two encoded sentences in two directions P against Q and P against Q. In each matching direction, each time step of one sentence is matched against all time-steps of the other sentence from multiple perspectives. Then, another BiLSTM layer is utilized to aggregate the matching results into a fix-length matching vector. Finally, based on the matching vector, a decision is made through a fully connected layer. We evaluate our model on three tasks: paraphrase identification, natural language inference and answer sentence selection. Experimental results on standard benchmark datasets show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on all tasks.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/579	Zhiguo Wang, Wael Hamza, Radu Florian
Learning Sentence Representation with Guidance of Human Attention	Recently, much progress has been made in learning general-purpose sentence representations that can be used across domains. However, most of the existing models typically treat each word in a sentence equally. In contrast, extensive studies have proven that human read sentences efficiently by making a sequence of fixation and saccades. This motivates us to improve sentence representations by assigning different weights to the vectors of the component words, which can be treated as an attention mechanism on single sentences. To that end, we propose two novel attention models, in which the attention weights are derived using significant predictors of human reading time, i.e., Surprisal, POS tags and CCG supertags. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art sentence representation models.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/578	Shaonan Wang, Jiajun Zhang, Chengqing Zong
Joint Learning on Relevant User Attributes in Micro-blog	User attribute classification aims to identify users' attributes (e.g., gender, age and profession) by leveraging user generated content. However, conventional approaches to user attribute classification focus on single attribute classification involving only one user attribute, which completely ignores the relationship among various user attributes. In this paper, we confront a novel scenario in user attribute classification where relevant user attributes are jointly learned, attempting to make the relevant attribute classification tasks help each other. Specifically, we propose a joint learning approach, namely Aux-LSTM, which first learns a proper auxiliary representation between the related tasks and then leverages the auxiliary representation to integrate the learning process in both tasks. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach to joint learning on relevant user attributes.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/577	Jingjing Wang, Shoushan Li, Guodong Zhou
Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Commonsense Machine Comprehension	Recently proposed Story Cloze Test [Mostafazadeh et al., 2016] is a commonsense machine comprehension application to deal with natural language understanding problem. This dataset contains a lot of story tests which require commonsense inference ability. Unfortunately, the training data is almost unsupervised where each context document followed with only one positive sentence that can be inferred from the context. However, in the testing period, we must make inference from two candidate sentences. To tackle this problem, we employ the generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate fake sentence. We proposed a Conditional GANs in which the generator is conditioned by the context. Our experiments show the advantage of the CGANs in discriminating sentence and achieve state-of-the-art results in commonsense story reading comprehension task compared with previous feature engineering and deep learning methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/576	Bingning Wang, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao
Multi-Modal Word Synset Induction	A word in natural language can be polysemous, having multiple meanings, as well as synonymous, meaning the same thing as other words. Word sense induction attempts to find the senses of polysemous words. Synonymy detection attempts to find when two words are interchangeable. We combine these tasks, first inducing word senses and then detecting similar senses to form word-sense synonym sets (synsets) in an unsupervised fashion. Given pairs of images and text with noun phrase labels, we perform synset induction to produce collections of underlying concepts described by one or more noun phrases. We find that considering multi-modal features from both visual and textual context yields better induced synsets than using either context alone. Human evaluations show that our unsupervised, multi-modally induced synsets are comparable in quality to annotation-assisted ImageNet synsets, achieving about 84% of ImageNet synsets' approval.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/575	Jesse Thomason, Raymond J.

From Neural Sentence Summarization to Headline Generation: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach	Headline generation is a task of abstractive text summarization, and previously suffers from the immaturity of natural language generation techniques. Recent success of neural sentence summarization models shows the capacity of generating informative, fluent headlines conditioned on selected recapitulative sentences. In this paper, we investigate the extension of sentence summarization models to the document headline generation task. The challenge is that extending the sentence summarization model to consider more document information will mostly confuse the model and hurt the performance. In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine approach, which first identifies the important sentences of a document using document summarization techniques, and then exploits a multi-sentence summarization model with hierarchical attention to leverage the important sentences for headline generation. Experimental results on a large real dataset demonstrate the proposed approach significantly improves the performance of neural sentence summarization models on the headline generation task.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/574	Jiwei Tan, Xiaojun Wan, Jianguo Xiao
Finding Prototypes of Answers for Improving Answer Sentence Selection	Answer sentence selection has been widely adopted recently for benchmarking techniques in Question Answering. Previous proposals for the task are essentially general solutions taking the form of neural networks that measure semantic similarity. In contrast, the present paper describes a simple technique to take advantage of such general-purpose tools for dealing with questions and answer sentences without changing the base system. The technique involves replacing wh-words in input questions with a word denoting the prototype of all answers. These transformed questions are passed as input to an existing neural network built for measuring semantic similarity. This technique is evaluated on two different neural network architectures over two datasets: TrecQA and WikiQA. Results of our experiments show improvement in overall accuracy across most question types we are interested in: `who', `when' and `where'-type questions.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/573	Wai Lok Tam, Namgi Han, Juan Ignacio Navarro-Horñiacek, Yusuke Miyao
Automatic Assessment of Absolute Sentence Complexity	Lexically and syntactically simpler sentences result in shorter reading time and better understanding in many people. However, no reliable systems for automatic assessment of absolute sentence complexity have been proposed so far. Instead, the assessment is usually done manually, requiring expert human annotators. To address this problem, we first define the sentence complexity assessment as a five-level classification task, and build a 'gold standard' dataset. Next, we propose robust systems for sentence complexity assessment, using a novel set of features based on leveraging lexical properties of freely available corpora, and investigate the impact of the feature type and corpus size on the classification performance.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/572	Sanja Stajner, Simone Paolo Ponzetto, Heiner Stuckenschmidt
Parsing Natural Language Conversations using Contextual Cues	In this work, we focus on semantic parsing of natural language conversations. Most existing methods for semantic parsing are based on understanding the semantics of a single sentence at a time. However, understanding conversations also requires an understanding of conversational context and discourse structure across sentences. We formulate semantic parsing of conversations as a structured prediction task, incorporating structural features that model the `flow of discourse' across sequences of utterances. We create a dataset for semantic parsing of conversations, consisting of 113 real-life sequences of interactions of human users with an automated email assistant. The data contains 4759 natural language statements paired with annotated logical forms. Our approach yields significant gains in performance over traditional semantic parsing.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/571	Shashank Srivastava, Amos Azaria, Tom Mitchell
Why Can't You Convince Me? Modeling Weaknesses in Unpersuasive Arguments	Recent work on argument persuasiveness has focused on determining how persuasive an argument is. Oftentimes, however, it is equally important to understand why an argument is unpersuasive, as it is difficult for an author to make her argument more persuasive unless she first knows what errors made it unpersuasive. Motivated by this practical concern, we (1) annotate a corpus of debate comments with not only their persuasiveness scores but also the errors they contain, (2) propose an approach to persuasiveness scoring and error identification that outperforms competing baselines, and (3) show that the persuasiveness scores computed by our approach can indeed be explained by the errors it identifies.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/570	Isaac Persing, Vincent Ng
Inverted Bilingual Topic Models for Lexicon Extraction from Non-parallel Data	"Topic models have been successfully applied in lexicon extraction. However, most previous methods are limited to document-aligned data. In this paper, we try to address two challenges of applying topic models to lexicon extraction in non-parallel data: 1) hard to model the word relationship and 2) noisy seed dictionary. To solve these two challenges, we propose two new bilingual topic models to better capture the semantic information of each word while discriminating the multiple translations in a noisy seed dictionary. We extend the scope of topic models by inverting the roles of ""word"" and ""document"". In addition, to solve the problem of noise in seed dictionary, we incorporate the probability of translation selection in our models. Moreover, we also propose an effective measure to evaluate the similarity of words in different languages and select the optimal translation pairs. Experimental results using real world data demonstrate the utility and efficacy of the proposed models."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/569	Tengfei Ma,  Tetsuya Nasukawa
Interactive Attention Networks for Aspect-Level Sentiment Classification	Aspect-level sentiment classification aims at identifying the sentiment polarity of specific target in its context. Previous approaches have realized the importance of targets in sentiment classification and developed various methods with the goal of precisely modeling thier contexts via generating target-specific representations. However, these studies always ignore the separate modeling of targets. In this paper, we argue that both targets and contexts deserve special treatment and need to be learned their own representations via interactive learning. Then, we propose the interactive attention networks (IAN) to interactively learn attentions in the contexts and targets, and generate the representations for targets and contexts separately. With this design, the IAN model can well represent a target and its collocative context, which is helpful to sentiment classification. Experimental results on SemEval 2014 Datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/568	Dehong Ma, Sujian Li, Xiaodong Zhang, Houfeng Wang
Adaptive Semantic Compositionality for Sentence Modelling	Representing a sentence with a fixed vector has shown its effectiveness in various NLP tasks. Most of the existing methods are based on neural network, which recursively apply different composition functions to a sequence of word vectors thereby obtaining a sentence vector.A hypothesis behind these approaches is that the meaning of any phrase can be composed of the meanings of its constituents.However, many phrases, such as idioms, are apparently non-compositional.To address this problem, we introduce a parameterized compositional switch, which outputs a scalar to adaptively determine whether the meaning of a phrase should be composed of its two constituents.We evaluate our model on five datasets of sentiment classification and demonstrate its efficacy with qualitative and quantitative experimental analysis .	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/567	Pengfei Liu, Xipeng Qiu, Xuanjing Huang
Dynamic Compositional Neural Networks over Tree Structure	Tree-structured neural networks have proven to be effective in learning semantic representations by exploitingsyntactic information. In spite of their success, most existing models suffer from the underfitting problem: they recursively use the same shared compositional function throughout the whole compositional process and lack expressive power due to inability to capture the richness of compositionality.In this paper, we address this issue by introducing the dynamic compositional neural networks over tree structure (DC-TreeNN), in which the compositional function is dynamically generated by a meta network.The role of meta-network is to capture the metaknowledge across the different compositional rules and formulate them. Experimental results on two typical tasks show the effectiveness of the proposed models.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/566	Pengfei Liu, Xipeng Qiu, Xuanjing Huang
A Structural Representation Learning for Multi-relational Networks	Most of the existing multi-relational network embedding methods, e.g., TransE, are formulated to preserve pair-wise connectivity structures in the networks. With the observations that significant triangular connectivity structures and parallelogram connectivity structures found in many real multi-relational networks are often ignored and that a hard-constraint commonly adopted by most of the network embedding methods is inaccurate by design, we propose a novel representation learning model for multi-relational networks which can alleviate both fundamental limitations. Scalable learning algorithms are derived using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm and negative sampling. Extensive experiments on real multi-relational network datasets of WordNet and Freebase demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model when compared with the state-of-the-art embedding methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/565	Lin Liu, Xin Li, William K. Cheung, Chengcheng Xu
How Unlabeled Web Videos Help Complex Event Detection?	The lack of labeled exemplars is an important factor that makes the task of multimedia event detection (MED) complicated and challenging. Utilizing artificially picked and labeled external sources is an effective way to enhance the performance of MED. However, building these data usually requires professional human annotators, and the procedure is too time-consuming and costly to scale. In this paper, we propose a new robust dictionary learning framework for complex event detection, which is able to handle both labeled and easy-to-get unlabeled web videos by sharing the same dictionary. By employing the lq-norm based loss jointly with the structured sparsity based regularization, our model shows strong robustness against the substantial noisy and outlier videos from open source. We exploit an effective optimization algorithm to solve the proposed highly non-smooth and non-convex problem. Extensive experiment results over standard datasets of TRECVID MEDTest 2013 and TRECVID MEDTest 2014 demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework on complex event detection.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/564	Huan Liu, Qinghua Zheng, Minnan Luo, Dingwen Zhang, Xiaojun Chang, Cheng Deng
MAT: A Multimodal Attentive Translator for Image Captioning	In this work we formulate the problem of image captioning as a multimodal translation task. Analogous to machine translation, we present a sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural networks (RNN) model for image caption generation. Different from most existing work where the whole image is represented by convolutional neural network (CNN) feature, we propose to represent the input image as a sequence of detected objects which feeds as the source sequence of the RNN model. In this way, the sequential representation of an image can be naturally translated to a sequence of words, as the target sequence of the RNN model. To represent the image in a sequential way, we extract the objects features in the image and arrange them in a order using convolutional neural networks. To further leverage the visual information from the encoded objects, a sequential attention layer is introduced to selectively attend to the objects that are related to generate corresponding words in the sentences. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed approach on popular benchmark dataset, i.e., MS COCO, and the proposed model surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in all metrics following the dataset splits of previous work. The proposed approach is also evaluated by the evaluation server of MS COCO captioning challenge, and achieves very competitive results, e.g., a CIDEr of 1.029 (c5) and 1.064 (c40).	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/563	Chang Liu, Fuchun Sun, Changhu Wang, Feng Wang, Alan Yuille
SWIM: A Simple Word Interaction Model for Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition	Capturing the semantic interaction of pairs of words across arguments and proper argument representation are both crucial issues in implicit discourse relation recognition. The current state-of-the-art represents arguments as distributional vectors that are computed via bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory networks (BiLSTMs), known to have significant model complexity.In contrast, we demonstrate that word-weighted averaging can encode argument representation which can incorporate word pair information efficiently. By saving an order of magnitude in parameters, our proposed model achieves equivalent performance, but trains seven times faster.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/562	Wenqiang Lei, Xuancong Wang, Meichun Liu, Ilija Ilievski, Xiangnan He, Min-Yen Kan
Learning to Explain Entity Relationships by Pairwise Ranking with Convolutional Neural Networks	Providing a plausible explanation for the relationship between two related entities is an important task in some applications of knowledge graphs, such as in search engines. However, most existing methods require a large number of manually labeled training data, which cannot be applied in large-scale knowledge graphs due to the expensive data annotation. In addition, these methods typically rely on costly handcrafted features. In this paper, we propose an effective pairwise ranking model by leveraging clickthrough data of a Web search engine to address these two problems. We first construct large-scale training data by leveraging the query-title pairs derived from clickthrough data of a Web search engine. Then, we build a pairwise ranking model which employs a convolutional neural network to automatically learn relevant features. The proposed model can be easily trained with backpropagation to perform the ranking task. The experiments show that our method significantly outperforms several strong baselines.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/561	Jizhou Huang, Wei Zhang, Shiqi Zhao, Shiqiang Ding, Haifeng Wang
Understanding and Exploiting Language Diversity	The main goal of this paper is to describe a general approach to the problem of understanding linguistic phenomena, as they appear in lexical semantics, through the analysis of large scale resources, while exploiting these results to improve the quality of the resources themselves. The main contributions are: the approach itself, a formal quantitative measure of language diversity; a set of formal quantitative measures of resource incompleteness and a large scale resource, called the Universal Knowledge Core (UKC) built following the methodology proposed. As a concrete example of an application, we provide an algorithm for distinguishing polysemes from homonyms, as stored in the UKC.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/560	Fausto Giunchiglia, Khuyagbaatar Batsuren, Gabor Bella
Effective Deep Memory Networks for Distant Supervised Relation Extraction	Distant supervised relation extraction (RE) has been an effective way of finding novel relational facts from text without labeled training data. Typically it can be formalized as a multi-instance multi-label problem.In this paper, we introduce a novel neural approach for distant supervised (RE) with specific focus on attention mechanisms.Unlike the feature-based logistic regression model and compositional neural models such as CNN, our approach includes two major attention-based memory components, which is capable of explicitly capturing the importance of each context word for modeling the representation of the entity pair, as well as the intrinsic dependencies between relations.Such importance degree and dependency relationship are calculated with multiple computational layers, each of which is a neural attention model over an external memory. Experiment on real-world datasets shows that our approach performs significantly and consistently better than various baselines.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/559	Xiaocheng Feng, Jiang Guo, Bing Qin, Ting Liu, Yongjie Liu
An Attention-based Regression Model for Grounding Textual Phrases in Images	Grounding, or localizing, a textual phrase in an image is a challenging problem that is integral to visual language understanding. Previous approaches to this task typically make use of candidate region proposals, where end performance depends on that of the region proposal method and additional computational costs are incurred. In this paper, we treat grounding as a regression problem and propose a method to directly identify the region referred to by a textual phrase, eliminating the need for external candidate region prediction. Our approach uses deep neural networks to combine image and text representations and refines the target region with attention models over both image subregions and words in the textual phrase. Despite the challenging nature of this task and sparsity of available data, in evaluation on the ReferIt dataset, our proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art in performance of 37.26% accuracy, surpassing the previously reported best by over 5 percentage points. We find that combining image and text attention models and an image attention area-sensitive loss function contribute to substantial improvements.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/558	Ko Endo, Masaki Aono, Eric Nichols, Kotaro Funakoshi
Stance Classification with Target-specific Neural Attention	Stance classification, which aims at detecting the stance expressed in text towards a specific target, is an emerging problem in sentiment analysis. A major difference between stance classification and traditional aspect-level sentiment classification is that the identification of stance is dependent on target which might not be explicitly mentioned in text. This indicates that apart from text content, the target information is important to stance detection. To this end, we propose a neural network-based model, which incorporates target-specific information into stance classification by following a novel attention mechanism. In specific, the attention mechanism is expected to locate the critical parts of text which are related to target. Our evaluations on both the English and Chinese Stance Detection datasets show that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/557	Jiachen Du, Ruifeng Xu, Yulan He, Lin Gui
Solving Probability Problems in Natural Language	The ability to solve probability word problems such as those found in introductory discrete mathematics textbooks, is an important cognitive and intellectual skill. In this paper, we develop a two-step end-to-end fully automated approach for solving such questions that is able to automatically provide answers to exercises about probability formulated in natural language.In the first step, a question formulated in natural language is analysed and transformed into a high-level model specified in a declarative language. In the second step, a solution to the high-level model is computed using a probabilistic programming system. On a dataset of 2160 probability problems, our solver is able to correctly answer 97.5% of the questions given a correct model. On the end-to-end evaluation, we are able to answer 12.5% of the questions (or 31.1% if we exclude examples not supported by design).	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/556	Anton Dries, Angelika Kimmig, Jesse Davis, Vaishak Belle, Luc de Raedt
Joint Training for Pivot-based Neural Machine Translation	While recent neural machine translation approaches have delivered state-of-the-art performance for resource-rich language pairs, they suffer from the data scarcity problem for resource-scarce language pairs. Although this problem can be alleviated by exploiting a pivot language to bridge the source and target languages, the source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target translation models are usually independently trained. In this work, we introduce a joint training algorithm for pivot-based neural machine translation. We propose three methods to connect the two models and enable them to interact with each other during training. Experiments on Europarl and WMT corpora show that joint training of source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target models leads to significant improvements over independent training across various languages.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/555	Yong Cheng, Qian Yang, Yang Liu, Maosong Sun, Wei Xu
Multimodal Storytelling via Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning	Deriving event storylines is an effective summarization method to succinctly organize extensive information, which can significantly alleviate the pain of information overload. The critical challenge is the lack of widely recognized definition of storyline metric. Prior studies have developed various approaches based on different assumptions about users' interests. These works can extract interesting patterns, but their assumptions do not guarantee that the derived patterns will match users' preference. On the other hand, their exclusiveness of single modality source misses cross-modality information. This paper proposes a method, multimodal imitation learning via Generative Adversarial Networks(MIL-GAN), to directly model users' interests as reflected by various data. In particular, the proposed model addresses the critical challenge by imitating users' demonstrated storylines. Our proposed model is designed to learn the reward patterns given user-provided storylines and then applies the learned policy to unseen data. The proposed approach is demonstrated to be capable of acquiring the user's implicit intent and outperforming competing methods by a substantial margin with a user study.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/554	Zhiqian Chen, Xuchao Zhang, Arnold P.

A Feature-Enriched Neural Model for Joint Chinese Word Segmentation and Part-of-Speech Tagging	Recently, neural network models for natural language processing tasks have been increasingly focused on for their ability of alleviating the burden of manual feature engineering. However, the previous neural models cannot extract the complicated feature compositions as the traditional methods with discrete features. In this work, we propose a feature-enriched neural model for joint Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging task. Specifically, to simulate the feature templates of traditional discrete feature based models, we use different filters to model the complex compositional features with convolutional and pooling layer, and then utilize long distance dependency information with recurrent layer. Experimental results on five different datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed model.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/553	Xinchi Chen, Xipeng Qiu, Xuanjing Huang
A Group-Based Personalized Model for Image Privacy Classification and Labeling	We address machine prediction of an individual's label (private or public) for a given image. This problem is difficult due to user subjectivity and inadequate labeled examples to train individual, personalized models. It is also time and space consuming to train a classifier for each user. We propose a Group-Based Personalized Model for image privacy classification in online social media sites, which learns a set of archetypical privacy models (groups), and associates a given user with one of these groups. Our system can be used to provide accurate ``early warnings'' with respect to a user's privacy awareness level.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/552	Haoti Zhong, Anna Squicciarini, David Miller, Cornelia Caragea
Efficient Label Contamination Attacks Against Black-Box Learning Models	Label contamination attack (LCA) is an important type of data poisoning attack where an attacker manipulates the labels of training data to make the learned model beneficial to him. Existing work on LCA assumes that the attacker has full knowledge of the victim learning model, whereas the victim model is usually a black-box to the attacker. In this paper, we develop a Projected Gradient Ascent (PGA) algorithm to compute LCAs on a family of empirical risk minimizations and show that an attack on one victim model can also be effective on other victim models. This makes it possible that the attacker designs an attack against a substitute model and transfers it to a black-box victim model. Based on the observation of the transferability, we develop a defense algorithm to identify the data points that are most likely to be attacked. Empirical studies show that PGA significantly outperforms existing baselines and linear learning models are better substitute models than nonlinear ones.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/551	Mengchen Zhao, Bo An, Wei Gao, Teng Zhang
Optimal Escape Interdiction on Transportation Networks	Preventing crimes or terrorist attacks in urban areas is challenging. Law enforcement officers need to respond quickly to catch the attacker on his escape route, which is subject to time-dependent traffic conditions on transportation networks. The attacker can strategically choose his escape path and driving speed to avoid being captured. Existing work on security resource allocation has not considered such scenarios with time-dependent strategies for both players. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of efficiently scheduling security resources for interdicting the escaping attacker. We propose: 1) a new defender-attacker security game model for escape interdiction on transportation networks; and 2) an efficient double oracle algorithm to compute the optimal defender strategy, which combines mixed-integer linear programming formulations for best response problems and effective approximation algorithms for improving the scalability of the algorithms. Experimental evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms baselines in solution quality and scales up to realistic-sized transportation networks with hundreds of intersections.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/550	Youzhi Zhang, Bo An, Long Tran-Thanh, Zhen Wang, Jiarui Gan, Nicholas R.

A Causal Framework for Discovering and Removing Direct and Indirect Discrimination	In this paper, we investigate the problem of discovering both direct and indirect discrimination from the historical data, and removing the discriminatory effects before the data is used for predictive analysis (e.g., building classifiers). The main drawback of existing methods is that they cannot distinguish the part of influence that is really caused by discrimination from all correlated influences. In our approach, we make use of the causal network to capture the causal structure of the data. Then we model direct and indirect discrimination as the path-specific effects, which accurately identify the two types of discrimination as the causal effects transmitted along different paths in the network. Based on that, we propose an effective algorithm for discovering direct and indirect discrimination, as well as an algorithm for precisely removing both types of discrimination while retaining good data utility. Experiments using the real dataset show the effectiveness of our approaches.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/549	Lu Zhang, Yongkai Wu, Xintao Wu
Efficient Private ERM for Smooth Objectives	In this paper, we consider efficient differentially private empirical risk minimization from the viewpoint of optimization algorithms. For strongly convex and smooth objectives, we prove that gradient descent with output perturbation not only achieves nearly optimal utility, but also significantly improves the running time of previous state-of-the-art private optimization algorithms, for both $\epsilon$-DP and $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP. For non-convex but smooth objectives, we propose an RRPSGD (Random Round Private Stochastic Gradient Descent) algorithm, which provably converges to a stationary point with privacy guarantee. Besides the expected utility bounds, we also provide guarantees in high probability form. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm consistently outperforms existing method in both utility and running time.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/548	Jiaqi Zhang, Kai Zheng, Wenlong Mou, Liwei Wang
Socialized Word Embeddings	Word embeddings have attracted a lot of attention. On social media, each user's language use can be significantly affected by the user's friends. In this paper, we propose a socialized word embedding algorithm which can consider both user's personal characteristics of language use and the user's social relationship on social media. To incorporate personal characteristics, we propose to use a user vector to represent each user. Then for each user, the word embeddings are trained based on each user's corpus by combining the global word vectors and local user vector. To incorporate social relationship, we add a regularization term to impose similarity between two friends. In this way, we can train the global word vectors and user vectors jointly. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we used the latest large-scale Yelp data to train our vectors, and designed several experiments to show how user vectors affect the results.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/547	Ziqian Zeng, Yichun Yin, Yangqiu Song, Ming Zhang
No Time to Observe: Adaptive Influence Maximization with Partial Feedback	Although influence maximization problem has been extensively studied over the past ten years, majority of existing work adopt one of the following models: full-feedback model or zero-feedback model. In the zero-feedback model, we have to commit the seed users all at once in advance, this strategy is also known as non-adaptive policy. In the full-feedback model, we select one seed at a time and wait until the diffusion completes, before selecting the next seed. Full-feedback model has better performance but potentially huge delay, zero-feedback model has zero delay but poorer performance since it does not utilize the observation that may be made during the seeding process. To fill the gap between these two models, we propose partial-feedback model, which allows us to select a seed at any intermediate stage. We develop a novel alpha-greedy policy that achieves a bounded approximation ratio.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/546	Jing Yuan, Shaojie Tang
A Convolutional Approach for Misinformation Identification	The fast expanding of social media fuels the spreading of misinformation which disrupts people's normal lives. It is urgent to achieve goals of misinformation identification and early detection in social media. In dynamic and complicated social media scenarios, some conventional methods mainly concentrate on feature engineering which fail to cover potential features in new scenarios and have difficulty in shaping elaborate high-level interactions among significant features. Moreover, a recent Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based method suffers from deficiencies that it is not qualified for practical early detection of misinformation and poses a bias to the latest input. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Convolutional Approach for Misinformation Identification (CAMI) based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CAMI can flexibly extract key features scattered among an input sequence and shape high-level interactions among significant features, which help effectively identify misinformation and achieve practical early detection. Experiment results on two large-scale datasets validate the effectiveness of CAMI model on both misinformation identification and early detection tasks.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/545	Feng Yu, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang, Tieniu Tan
Fast Network Embedding Enhancement via High Order Proximity Approximation	Many Network Representation Learning (NRL) methods have been proposed to learn vector representations for vertices in a network recently. In this paper, we summarize most existing NRL methods into a unified two-step framework, including proximity matrix construction and dimension reduction. We focus on the analysis of proximity matrix construction step and conclude that an NRL method can be improved by exploring higher order proximities when building the proximity matrix. We propose Network Embedding Update (NEU) algorithm which implicitly approximates higher order proximities with theoretical approximation bound and can be applied on any NRL methods to enhance their performances. We conduct experiments on multi-label classification and link prediction tasks. Experimental results show that NEU can make a consistent and significant improvement over a number of NRL methods with almost negligible running time on all three publicly available datasets.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/544	Cheng Yang, Maosong Sun, Zhiyuan Liu, Cunchao Tu
Beyond Universal Saliency: Personalized Saliency Prediction with Multi-task CNN	Saliency detection is a long standing problem in computer vision. Tremendous efforts have been focused on exploring a universal saliency model across users despite their differences in gender, race, age, etc. Yet recent psychology studies suggest that saliency is highly specific than universal: individuals exhibit heterogeneous gaze patterns when viewing an identical scene containing multiple salient objects. In this paper, we first show that such heterogeneity is common and critical for reliable saliency prediction. Our study also produces the first database of personalized saliency maps (PSMs). We model PSM based on universal saliency map (USM) shared by different participants and adopt a multi-task CNN framework to estimate the discrepancy between PSM and USM. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our new PSM model and prediction scheme are effective and reliable.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/543	Yanyu Xu, Nianyi Li, Junru Wu, Jingyi Yu, Shenghua Gao
Predicting Alzheimer's Disease Cognitive Assessment via Robust Low-Rank Structured Sparse Model	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with slow onset, which could result in the deterioration of the duration of persistent neurological dysfunction. How to identify the informative longitudinal phenotypic neuroimaging markers and predict cognitive measures are crucial to recognize AD at early stage. Many existing models related imaging measures to cognitive status using regression models, but they did not take full consideration of the interaction between cognitive scores. In this paper, we propose a robust low-rank structured sparse regression method (RLSR) to address this issue. The proposed model simultaneously selects effective features and learns the underlying structure between cognitive scores by utilizing novel mixed structured sparsity inducing norms and low-rank approximation. In addition, an efficient algorithm is derived to solve the proposed non-smooth objective function with proved convergence. Empirical studies on cognitive data of the ADNI cohort demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/542	Jie Xu, Cheng Deng, Xinbo Gao, Dinggang Shen, Heng Huang
Online Reputation Fraud Campaign Detection in User Ratings	Reputation fraud campaigns (RFCs) distort the reputations of rated items, by generating fake ratings through multiple spammers. One effective way of detecting RFCs is to characterize their collective behaviors based on rating histories.However, these campaigns are constantly evolving and changing tactics to evade detection.For example, they can launch early attacks on the items to quickly dominate the reputations.They can also whitewash themselves through creating new accounts for subsequent attacks.It is thus challenging for existing approaches working on historical data to promptly react to such emerging fraud activities.In this paper, we conduct RFC detection in online fashion, so as to spot campaign activities as early as possible.This leads to a unified and scalable optimization framework, FraudScan, that can adapt to emerging fraud patterns over time.Empirical analysis on two real-world datasets validates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/541	Chang Xu, Jie Zhang, Zhu Sun
A Trust-based Mixture of Gaussian Processes Model for Reliable Regression in Participatory Sensing	Data trustworthiness is a crucial issue in real-world participatory sensing applications. Without considering this issue, different types of worker misbehavior, especially the challenging collusion attacks, can result in biased and inaccurate estimation and decision making. We propose a novel trust-based mixture of Gaussian processes (GP) model for spatial regression to jointly detect such misbehavior and accurately estimate the spatial field. We develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based algorithm to efficiently perform Bayesian inference of the model. Experiments using two real-world datasets show the superior robustness of our model compared with existing approaches.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/540	Qikun Xiang, Jie Zhang, Ido Nevat, Pengfei Zhang
Predicting the Quality of Short Narratives from Social Media	An important and difficult challenge in building computational models for narratives is the automatic evaluation of narrative quality. Quality evaluation connects narrative understanding and generation as generation systems need to evaluate their own products. To circumvent difficulties in acquiring annotations, we employ upvotes in social media as an approximate measure for story quality. We collected 54,484 answers from a crowd-powered question-and-answer website, Quora, and then used active learning to build a classifier that labeled 28,320 answers as stories. To predict the number of upvotes without the use of social network features, we create neural networks that model textual regions and the interdependence among regions, which serve as strong benchmarks for future research. To our best knowledge, this is the first large-scale study for automatic evaluation of narrative quality.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/539	Tong Wang, Ping Chen, Boyang Li
Interactive Narrative Personalization with Deep Reinforcement Learning	Data-driven techniques for interactive narrative generation are the subject of growing interest. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers significant potential for devising data-driven interactive narrative generators that tailor players' story experiences by inducing policies from player interaction logs. A key open question in RL-based interactive narrative generation is how to model complex player interaction patterns to learn effective policies. In this paper we present a deep RL-based interactive narrative generation framework that leverages synthetic data produced by a bipartite simulated player model. Specifically, the framework involves training a set of Q-networks to control adaptable narrative event sequences with long short-term memory network-based simulated players. We investigate the deep RL framework's performance with an educational interactive narrative, Crystal Island. Results suggest that the deep RL-based narrative generation framework yields effective personalized interactive narratives.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/538	Pengcheng Wang, Jonathan Rowe, Wookhee Min, Bradford Mott, James Lester
The Minds of Many: Opponent Modeling in a Stochastic Game	The Theory of Mind provides a framework for an agent to predict the actions of adversaries by building an abstract model of their strategies using recursive nested beliefs. In this paper, we extend a recently introduced technique for opponent modeling based on Theory of Mind reasoning. Our extended multi-agent Theory of Mind model explicitly considers multiple opponents simultaneously. We introduce a stereotyping mechanism, which segments the agent population into sub-groups of agents with similar behavior. Here, sub-group profiles guide decision making in place of individual agent profiles. We evaluate our model using a multi-player stochastic game, which presents agents with the challenge of unknown adversaries in a partially-observable environment. Simulation results demonstrate that the model performs well under uncertainty and that stereotyping allows larger groups of agents to be modeled robustly. The findings strengthen results showing that Theory of Mind modeling is useful in many artificial intelligence applications.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/537	Friedrich Burkhard von der Osten, Michael Kirley, Tim Miller
Depression Detection via Harvesting Social Media: A Multimodal Dictionary Learning Solution	Depression is a major contributor to the overall global burden of diseases. Traditionally, doctors diagnose depressed people face to face via referring to clinical depression criteria. However, more than 70% of the patients would not consult doctors at early stages of depression, which leads to further deterioration of their conditions. Meanwhile, people are increasingly relying on social media to disclose emotions and sharing their daily lives, thus social media have successfully been leveraged for helping detect physical and mental diseases. Inspired by these, our work aims to make timely depression detection via harvesting social media data. We construct well-labeled depression and non-depression dataset on Twitter, and extract six depression-related feature groups covering not only the clinical depression criteria, but also online behaviors on social media. With these feature groups, we propose a multimodal depressive dictionary learning model to detect the depressed users on Twitter. A series of experiments are conducted to validate this model, which outperforms (+3% to +10%) several baselines. Finally, we analyze a large-scale dataset on Twitter to reveal the underlying online behaviors between depressed and non-depressed users.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/536	Guangyao Shen, Jia Jia, Liqiang Nie, Fuli Feng, Cunjun Zhang, Tianrui Hu, Tat-Seng Chua, Wenwu Zhu
A Monte Carlo Tree Search approach to Active Malware Analysis	Active Malware Analysis (AMA) focuses on acquiring knowledge about dangerous software by executing actions that trigger a response in the malware. A key problem for AMA is to design strategies that select most informative actions for the analysis. To devise such actions, we model AMA as a stochastic game between an analyzer agent and a malware sample, and we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search. Crucially, our approach does not require a pre-specified malware model but, in contrast to most existing analysis techniques, we generate such model while interacting with the malware. We evaluate our solution using clustering techniques on models generated by analyzing real malware samples. Results show that our approach learns faster than existing techniques even without any prior information on the samples.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/535	Riccardo Sartea, Alessandro Farinelli
Leveraging Human Knowledge in Tabular Reinforcement Learning: A Study of Human Subjects	Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be extremely effective in solving complex, real-world problems. However, injecting human knowledge into an RL agent may require extensive effort on the human designer's part. To date, human factors are generally not considered in the development and evaluation of possible approaches. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel method, based on human psychology literature, which we show to be both effective and efficient, for both expert and non-expert designers, in injecting human knowledge for speeding up tabular RL.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/534	Ariel Rosenfeld, Matthew E.

When Security Games Hit Traffic: Optimal Traffic Enforcement Under One Sided Uncertainty	Efficient traffic enforcement is an essential, yet complex, component in preventing road accidents. In this paper, we present a novel model and an optimizing algorithm for mitigating some of the computational challenges of real-world traffic enforcement allocation in large road networks. Our approach allows for scalable, coupled and non-Markovian optimization of multiple police units and guarantees optimality. In an extensive empirical evaluation we show that our approach favorably compares to several baseline solutions achieving a significant speed-up, using both synthetic and real-world road networks.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/533	Ariel Rosenfeld, Sarit Kraus
Cognitive-Inspired Conversational-Strategy Reasoner for Socially-Aware Agents	In this work we propose a novel module for a dialogue system that allows a conversational agent to utter phrases that do not just meet the system's task intentions, but also work towards achieving the system's social intentions. The module - a Social Reasoner - takes the task goals the system must achieve and decides the appropriate conversational style and strategy with which the dialogue system describes the information the user desires so as to boost the strength of the relationship between the user and system (rapport), and therefore the user's engagement and willingness to divulge the information the agent needs to efficiently and effectively achieve the user's goals. Our Social Reasoner is inspired both by analysis of empirical data of friends and stranger dyads engaged in a task, and by prior literature in fields as diverse as reasoning processes in cognitive and social psychology, decision-making, sociolinguistics and conversational analysis. Our experiments demonstrated that, when using the Social Reasoner in a Dialogue System, the rapport level between the user and system increases in more than 35% in comparison with those cases where no Social Reasoner is used.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/532	Oscar J.

Unified Representation and Lifted Sampling for Generative Models of Social Networks	Statistical models of network structure are widely used in network science to reason about the properties of complex systems—where the nodes and edges represent entities and their relationships. Recently, a number of generative network models (GNM) have been developed that accurately capture characteristics of real world networks, but since they are typically defined in a procedural manner, it is difficult to identify commonalities in their structure. Moreover, procedural definitions make it difficult to develop statistical sampling algorithms that are both efficient and correct. In this paper, we identify a family of GNMs that share a common latent structure and create a Bayesian network (BN) representation that captures their common form. We show how to reduce two existing GNMs to this representation. Then, using the BN representation we develop a generalized, efficient, and provably correct, sampling method that exploits parametric symmetries and deterministic context-specific dependence. Finally, we use the new representation to design a novel GNM and evaluate it empirically.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/531	Pablo Robles-Granda, Sebastian Moreno, Jennifer Neville
Quantifying Aspect Bias in Ordinal Ratings using a Bayesian Approach	User opinions expressed in the form of ratings can influence an individual's view of an item. However, the true quality of an item is often obfuscated by user biases, and it is not obvious from the observed ratings the importance different users place on different aspects of an item. We propose a probabilistic modeling of the observed aspect ratings to infer (i) each user's aspect bias and (ii) latent intrinsic quality of an item. We model multi-aspect ratings as ordered discrete data and encode the dependency between different aspects by using a latent Gaussian structure. We handle the Gaussian-Categorical non-conjugacy using a stick-breaking formulation coupled with P\'{o}lya-Gamma auxiliary variable augmentation for a simple, fully Bayesian inference. On two real world datasets, we demonstrate the predictive ability of our model and its effectiveness in learning explainable user biases to provide insights towards a more reliable product quality estimation.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/530	Lahari Poddar, Wynne Hsu, Mong Li Lee
Thwarting Vote Buying Through Decoy Ballots	There is increasing interest in promoting participatory democracy, in particular by allowing voting by mail or internet and through random-sample elections. A pernicious concern, though, is that of vote buying, which occurs when a bad actor seeks to buy ballots, paying someone to vote against their own intent. This becomes possible whenever a voter is able to sell evidence of which way she voted. We show how to thwart vote buying through decoy ballots, which are not counted but are indistinguishable from real ballots to a buyer. We show that an Election Authority can significantly reduce the power of vote buying through a small number of optimally distributed decoys, and model societal processes by which decoys could be distributed.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/529	David C.

Blue Skies: A Methodology for Data-Driven Clear Sky Modelling	One of the major challenges confronting the widespread adoption of solar energy is the uncertainty of production. The energy generated by photo-voltaic systems is a function of the received solar irradiance which varies due to atmospheric and weather conditions. A key component required for forecasting irradiance accurately is the clear sky model which estimates the average irradiance at a location at a given time in the absence of clouds. Current methods for modelling clear sky irradiance are either inaccurate or require extensive atmospheric data, which tends to vary with location and is often unavailable. In this paper, we present a data-driven methodology, Blue Skies, for modelling clear sky irradiance solely based on historical irradiance measurements. Using machine learning techniques, Blue Skies is able to generate clear sky models that are more accurate spatio-temporally compared to the state of the art, reducing errors by almost 50%.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/528	Kartik Palani, Ramachandra Kota, Amar Prakash Azad, Vijay Arya
Staying Ahead of the Game: Adaptive Robust Optimization for Dynamic Allocation of Threat Screening Resources	We consider the problem of dynamically allocating screening resources of different efficacies (e.g., magnetic or X-ray imaging) at checkpoints (e.g., at airports or ports) to successfully avert an attack by one of the screenees. Previously, the Threat Screening Game model was introduced to address this problem under the assumption that screenee arrival times are perfectly known. In reality, arrival times are uncertain, which severely impedes the implementability and performance of this approach. We thus propose a novel framework for dynamic allocation of threat screening resources that explicitly accounts for uncertainty in the screenee arrival times. We model the problem as a multistage robust optimization problem and propose a tractable solution approach using compact linear decision rules combined with robust reformulation and constraint randomization. We perform extensive numerical experiments which showcase that our approach outperforms (a) exact solution methods in terms of tractability, while incurring only a very minor loss in optimality, and (b) methods that ignore uncertainty in terms of both feasibility and optimality.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/527	Sara Marie Mc Carthy, Phebe Vayanos, Milind Tambe
Adversarial Generation of Real-time Feedback with Neural Networks for Simulation-based Training	Simulation-based training (SBT) is gaining popularity as a low-cost and convenient training technique in a vast range of applications. However, for a SBT platform to be fully utilized as an effective training tool, it is essential that feedback on performance is provided automatically in real-time during training. It is the aim of this paper to develop an efficient and effective feedback generation method for the provision of real-time feedback in SBT. Existing methods either have low effectiveness in improving novice skills or suffer from low efficiency, resulting in their inability to be used in real-time. In this paper, we propose a neural network based method to generate feedback using the adversarial technique. The proposed method utilizes a bounded adversarial update to minimize a L1 regularized loss via back-propagation. We empirically show that the proposed method can be used to generate simple, yet effective feedback. Also, it was observed to have high effectiveness and efficiency when compared to existing methods, thus making it a promising option for real-time feedback generation in SBT.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/526	Xingjun Ma, Sudanthi Wijewickrema, Shuo Zhou, Yun Zhou, Zakaria Mhammedi, Stephen O'Leary, James Bailey
Tactics of Adversarial Attack on Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents	We introduce two tactics, namely the strategically-timed attack and the enchanting attack, to attack reinforcement learning agents trained by deep reinforcement learning algorithms using adversarial examples. In the strategically-timed attack, the adversary aims at minimizing the agent's reward by only attacking the agent at a small subset of time steps in an episode. Limiting the attack activity to this subset helps prevent detection of the attack by the agent. We propose a novel method to determine when an adversarial example should be crafted and applied. In the enchanting attack, the adversary aims at luring the agent to a designated target state. This is achieved by combining a generative model and a planning algorithm: while the generative model predicts the future states, the planning algorithm generates a preferred sequence of actions for luring the agent. A sequence of adversarial examples is then crafted to lure the agent to take the preferred sequence of actions. We apply the proposed tactics to the agents trained by the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm including DQN and A3C. In 5 Atari games, our strategically-timed attack reduces as much reward as the uniform attack (i.e., attacking at every time step) does by attacking the agent 4 times less often. Our enchanting attack lures the agent toward designated target states with a more than 70% success rate. Example videos are available at http://yclin.me/adversarial_attack_RL/.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/525	Yen-Chen Lin, Zhang-Wei Hong, Yuan-Hong Liao, Meng-Li Shih, Ming-Yu Liu, Min Sun
How to Keep a Knowledge Base Synchronized with Its Encyclopedia Source	Knowledge bases are playing an increasingly important role in many real-world applications. However, most of these knowledge bases tend to be outdated, which limits the utility of these knowledge bases. In this paper, we investigate how to keep the freshness of the knowledge base by synchronizing it with its data source (usually encyclopedia websites). A direct solution is revisiting the whole encyclopedia periodically and rerun the entire pipeline of the construction of knowledge base like most existing methods. However, this solution is wasteful and incurs massive overload of the network, which limits the update frequency and leads to knowledge obsolescence. To overcome the weakness, we propose a set of synchronization principles upon which we build an Update System for knowledge Base (USB) with an update frequency predictor of entities as the core component. We also design a set of effective features and realize the predictor. We conduct extensive experiments to justify the effectiveness of the proposed system, model, as well as the underlying principles. Finally, we deploy USB on a Chinese knowledge base to improve its freshness.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/524	Jiaqing Liang, Sheng Zhang, Yanghua Xiao
Defending Against Man-In-The-Middle Attack in Repeated Games	The Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack has become widespread in networks nowadays. The MITM attack would cause serious information leakage and result in tremendous loss to users. Previous work applies game theory to analyze the MITM attack-defense problem and computes the optimal defense strategy to minimize the total loss. It assumes that all defenders are cooperative and the attacker know defenders' strategies beforehand. However, each individual defender is rational and may not have the incentive to cooperate. Furthermore, the attacker can hardly know defenders' strategies ahead of schedule in practice. To this end, we assume that all defenders are self-interested and model the MITM attack-defense scenario as a simultaneous-move game. Nash equilibrium is adopted as the solution concept which is proved to be always unique. Given the impracticability of computing Nash equilibrium directly, we propose practical adaptive algorithms for the defenders and the attacker to learn towards the unique Nash equilibrium through repeated interactions. Simulation results show that the algorithms are able to converge to Nash equilibrium strategy efficiently.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/523	Shuxin Li, Xiaohong Li, Jianye Hao, Bo An, Zhiyong Feng, Kangjie Chen, Chengwei Zhang
Stratified Strategy Selection for Unit Control in Real-Time Strategy Games	In this paper we introduce Stratified Strategy Selection (SSS), a novel search algorithm for micromanaging units in real-time strategy (RTS) games. SSS uses a type system to partition the player's units into types and assumes that units of the same type must follow the same strategy. SSS searches in the state space induced by the type system to select, from a pool of options, a strategy for each unit. Empirical results on a simulator of an RTS game shows that SSS employing either fixed or adaptive type systems is able to substantially outperform state-of-the-art search-based algorithms in combat scenarios with up to 100 units.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/522	Levi H.

Exploring Personalized Neural Conversational Models	Modeling dialog systems is currently one of the most active problems in Natural Language Processing. Recent advancement in Deep Learning has sparked an interest in the use of neural networks in modeling language, particularly for personalized conversational agents that can retain contextual information during dialog exchanges. This work carefully explores and compares several of the recently proposed neural conversation models, and carries out a detailed evaluation on the multiple factors that can significantly affect predictive performance, such as pretraining, embedding training, data cleaning, diversity reranking, evaluation setting, etc. Based on the tradeoffs of different models, we propose a new generative dialogue model conditioned on speakers as well as context history that outperforms all previous models on both retrieval and generative metrics. Our findings indicate that pretraining speaker embeddings on larger datasets, as well as bootstrapping word and speaker embeddings, can significantly improve performance (up to 3 points in perplexity), and that promoting diversity in using Mutual Information based techniques has a very strong effect in ranking metrics.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/521	Satwik Kottur, Xiaoyu Wang, Vitor Carvalho
Fashion Style Generator	In this paper, we focus on a new problem: applying artificial intelligence to automatically generate fashion style images. Given a basic clothing image and a fashion style image (e.g., leopard print), we generate a clothing image with the certain style in real time with a neural fashion style generator. Fashion style generation is related to recent artistic style transfer works, but has its own challenges. The synthetic image should preserve the similar design as the basic clothing, and meanwhile blend the new style pattern on the clothing. Neither existing global nor patch based neural style transfer methods could well solve these challenges. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end feed-forward neural network which consists of a fashion style generator and a discriminator. The global and patch based style and content losses calculated by the discriminator alternatively back-propagate the generator network and optimize it. The global optimization stage preserves the clothing form and design and the local optimization stage preserves the detailed style pattern. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-arts.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/520	Shuhui Jiang, Yun Fu
Who to Invite Next? Predicting Invitees of Social Groups	Social instant messaging services (SMS) such as WhatsApp, Snapchat and WeChat, have significantly changed the way people work, live, and communicate, attracting increasing attention from multiple disciplinary including computer science, sociology, psychology, and physics. In SMS, social groups play a very important role in supporting communication among multiple users. An interesting question arises: what are the dynamic mechanisms underlying the group evolution? Or more specifically, in an existing group, who should be invited to join? In this paper, we formalize a novel problem of predicting potential invitees of groups. Employing WeChat, the largest social messaging service in China, as the source for our experimental data, we develop a probabilistic graph model to capture the fundamental factors that determine the probability of a user to be invited to a specific social group. Our results show that the proposed model indeed lead to statistically significant prediction improvements over several state-of-the-art baseline methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/519	Yu Han, Jie Tang
Game Engine Learning from Video	Intelligent agents need to be able to make predictions about their environment. In this work we present a novel approach to learn a forward simulation model via simple search over pixel input. We make use of a video game, Super Mario Bros., as an initial test of our approach as it represents a physics system that is significantly less complex than reality. We demonstrate the significant improvement of our approach in predicting future states compared with a baseline CNN and apply the learned model to train a game playing agent. Thus we evaluate the algorithm in terms of the accuracy and value of its output model.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/518	Matthew Guzdial, Boyang Li, Mark O. Riedl
Modeling Physicians' Utterances to Explore Diagnostic Decision-making	Diagnostic error prevention is a long-established but specialized topic in clinical and psychological research. In this paper, we contribute to the field by exploring diagnostic decision-making via modeling physicians' utterances of medical concepts during image-based diagnoses. We conduct experiments to collect verbal narratives from dermatologists while they are examining and describing dermatology images towards diagnoses. We propose a hierarchical probabilistic framework to learn domain-specific patterns from the medical concepts in these narratives. The discovered patterns match the diagnostic units of thought identified by domain experts. These meaningful patterns uncover physicians' diagnostic decision-making processes while parsing the image content. Our evaluation shows that these patterns provide key information to classify narratives by diagnostic correctness levels.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/517	Xuan Guo, Rui Li, Qi Yu, Anne Haake
Comparing Strategic Secrecy and Stackelberg Commitment in Security Games	The Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE) has drawn extensive attention recently in several security domains. However, the SSE concept neglects the advantage of defender's strategic revelation of her private information, and overestimates the observation ability of the adversaries. In this paper, we overcome these restrictions and analyze the tradeoff between strategic secrecy and commitment in security games. We propose a Disguised-resource Security Game (DSG) where the defender strategically disguises some of her resources. We compare strategic information revelation with public commitment and formally show that they have different advantages depending the payoff structure. To compute the Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (PBE), several novel approaches are provided, including a novel algorithm based on support set enumeration, and an approximation algorithm for \epsilon-PBE. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that both strategic secrecy and Stackelberg commitment are critical measures in security domain, and our approaches can efficiently solve PBEs for realistic-sized problems.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/516	Qingyu Guo, Bo An, Branislav Bošanský, Christopher Kiekintveld
Playing Repeated Network Interdiction Games with Semi-Bandit Feedback	We study repeated network interdiction games with no prior knowledge of the adversary and the environment, which can model many real world network security domains. Existing works often require plenty of available information for the defender and neglect the frequent interactions between both players, which are unrealistic and impractical, and thus, are not suitable for our settings. As such, we provide the first defender strategy, that enjoys nice theoretical and practical performance guarantees, by applying the adversarial online learning approach. In particular, we model the repeated network interdiction game with no prior knowledge as an online linear optimization problem, for which a novel and efficient online learning algorithm, SBGA, is proposed, which exploits the unique semi-bandit feedback in network security domains. We prove that SBGA achieves sublinear regret against adaptive adversary, compared with both the best fixed strategy in hindsight and a near optimal adaptive strategy. Extensive experiments also show that SBGA significantly outperforms existing approaches with fast convergence rate.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/515	Qingyu Guo, Bo An, Long Tran-Thanh
DeepAM: Migrate APIs with Multi-modal Sequence to Sequence Learning	Computer programs written in one language are often required to be ported to other languages to support multiple devices and environments. When programs use language specific APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), it is very challenging to migrate these APIs to the corresponding APIs written in other languages. Existing approaches mine API mappings from projects that have corresponding versions in two languages. They rely on the sparse availability of bilingual projects, thus producing a limited number of API mappings. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system called DeepAM for automatically mining API mappings from a large-scale code corpus without bilingual projects. The key component of DeepAM is based on the multi-modal sequence to sequence learning architecture that aims to learn joint semantic representations of bilingual API sequences from big source code data. Experimental results indicate that DeepAM significantly increases the accuracy of API mappings as well as the number of API mappings when compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/514	Xiaodong Gu, Hongyu Zhang, Dongmei Zhang, Sunghun Kim
Focused Depth-first Proof Number Search using Convolutional Neural Networks for the Game of Hex	Proof Number search (PNS) is an effective algorithm for searching theoretical values on games with non-uniform branching factors. Focused depth-first proof number search (FDFPN) with dynamic widening was proposed for Hex where the branching factor is nearly uniform. However, FDFPN is fragile to its heuristic move ordering function. The recent advances of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have led to considerable progress in game playing. We investigate how to incorporate the strength of CNNs into solving, with application to the game of Hex. We describe FDFPN-CNN, a new focused DFPN search that uses convolutional neural networks. FDFPN-CNN integrates two CNNs trained from games played by expert players. The value approximation CNN provides reliable information for defining the widening size by estimating the value of the node to expand, while the policy CNN selects promising children nodes to the search. On 8x8 Hex, experimental results show FDFPN-CNN performs notably better than FDFPN, suggesting a promising direction for better solving Hex positions where learning from strong players is possible.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/513	Chao Gao, Martin Müller, Ryan Hayward
Social Pressure in Opinion Games	Motivated by privacy and security concerns in online social networks, we study the role of social pressure in opinion games. These are games, important in economics and sociology, that model the formation of opinions in a social network. We enrich the definition of (noisy) best-response dynamics for opinion games by introducing the pressure, increasing with time, to reach an agreement.We prove that for clique social networks, the dynamics always converges to consensus (no matter the level of noise) if the social pressure is high enough. Moreover, we provide (tight) bounds on the speed of convergence; these bounds are polynomial in the number of players provided that the pressure grows sufficiently fast.We finally look beyond cliques: we characterize the graphs for which consensus is guaranteed, and make some considerations on the computational complexity of checking whether a graph satisfies such a condition.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/512	Diodato Ferraioli, Carmine Ventre
Exploiting Music Play Sequence for Music Recommendation	Users leave digital footprints when interacting with various music streaming services. Music play sequence, which contains rich information about personal music preference and song similarity, has been largely ignored in previous music recommender systems. In this paper, we explore the effects of music play sequence on developing effective personalized music recommender systems. Towards the goal, we propose to use word embedding techniques in music play sequences to estimate the similarity between songs. The learned similarity is then embedded into matrix factorization to boost the latent feature learning and discovery. Furthermore, the proposed method only considers the k-nearest songs (e.g., k = 5) in the learning process and thus avoids the increase of time complexity. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that our methods could significantly improve the performance of both rating prediction and top-n recommendation tasks.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/511	Zhiyong Cheng, Jialie Shen, Lei Zhu, Mohan Kankanhalli, Liqiang Nie
Opinion-aware Knowledge Graph for Political Ideology Detection	Identifying individual's political ideology from their speeches and written texts is important for analyzing political opinions and user behavior on social media. Traditional opinion mining methods rely on bag-of-words representations to classify texts into different ideology categories. Such methods are too coarse for understanding political ideologies. The key to identify different ideologies is to recognize different opinions expressed toward a specific topic. To model this insight, we classify ideologies based on the distribution of opinions expressed towards real-world entities or topics. Specifically, we propose a novel approach to political ideology detection that makes predictions based on an opinion-aware knowledge graph. We show how to construct such graph by integrating the opinions and targeted entities extracted from text into an existing structured knowledge base, and show how to perform ideology inference by information propagation on the graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high accuracy in detecting ideologies compared to baselines including LR, SVM and RNN.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/510	Wei Chen, Xiao Zhang, Tengjiao Wang, Bishan Yang, Yi Li
Deep Multi-species Embedding	Understanding how species are distributed across landscapes over time is a fundamental question in biodiversity research. Unfortunately, most species distribution models only target a single species at a time, despite strong ecological evidence that species are not independently distributed. We propose Deep Multi-Species Embedding (DMSE), which jointly embeds vectors corresponding to multiple species as well as vectors representing environmental covariates into a common high-dimensional feature space via a deep neural network. Applied to bird observational data from the citizen science project eBird, we demonstrate how the DMSE model discovers inter-species relationships to outperform single-species distribution models (random forests and SVMs) as well as competing multi-label models. Additionally, we demonstrate the benefit of using a deep neural network to extract features within the embedding and show how they improve the predictive performance of species distribution modelling. An important domain contribution of the DMSE model is the ability to discover and describe species interactions while simultaneously learning the shared habitat preferences among species. As an additional contribution, we provide a graphical embedding of hundreds of bird species in the Northeast US.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/509	Di Chen, Yexiang Xue, Daniel Fink, Shuo Chen, Carla P.

Networked Fairness in Cake Cutting	We introduce a graphical framework for fair division in cake cutting, where comparisons between agents are limited by an underlying network structure. We generalize the classical fairness notions of envy-freeness and proportionality in this graphical setting. An allocation is called envy-free on a graph if no agent envies any of her neighbor's share, and is called proportional on a graph if every agent values her own share no less than the average among her neighbors, with respect to her own measure. These generalizations enable new research directions in developing simple and efficient algorithms that can produce fair allocations under specific graph structures. On the algorithmic frontier, we first propose a moving-knife algorithm that outputs an envy-free allocation on trees. The algorithm is significantly simpler than the discrete and bounded envy-free algorithm introduced in [Aziz and Mackenzie, 2016] for compete graphs. Next, we give a discrete and bounded algorithm for computing a proportional allocation on transitive closure of trees, a class of graphs by taking a rooted tree and connecting all its ancestor-descendant pairs.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/508	Xiaohui Bei, Youming Qiao, Shengyu Zhang
Cake Cutting: Envy and Truth	We study envy-free cake cutting with strategic agents, where each agent may manipulate his private information in order to receive a better allocation. We focus on piecewise constant utility functions and consider two scenarios: the general setting without any restriction on the allocations and the restricted setting where each agent has to receive a connected piece. We show that no deterministic truthful envy-free mechanism exists in the connected piece scenario, and the same impossibility result for the general setting with some additional mild assumptions on the allocations. Finally, we study a large market model where the economy is replicated and demonstrate that truth-telling converges to a Nash equilibrium.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/507	Xiaohui Bei, Ning Chen, Guangda Huzhang, Biaoshuai Tao, Jiajun Wu
Understanding People Lifestyles: Construction of Urban Movement Knowledge Graph from GPS Trajectory	Technologies are increasingly taking advantage of the explosion in the amount of data generated by social multimedia (e.g., web searches, ad targeting, and urban computing). In this paper, we propose a multi-view learning framework for presenting the construction of a new urban movement knowledge graph, which could greatly facilitate the research domains mentioned above. In particular, by viewing GPS trajectory data from temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal points of view, we construct a knowledge graph of which nodes and edges are their locations and relations, respectively. On the knowledge graph, both nodes and edges are represented in latent semantic space. We verify its utility by subsequently applying the knowledge graph to predict the extent of user attention (high or low) paid to different locations in a city. Experimental evaluations and analysis of a real-world dataset show significant improvements in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/506	Chenyi Zhuang, Nicholas Jing Yuan, Ruihua Song, Xing Xie, Qiang Ma
Object Recognition with and without Objects	While recent deep neural networks have achieved a promising performance on object recognition, they rely implicitly on the visual contents of the whole image. In this paper, we train deep neural networks on the foreground (object) and background (context) regions of images respectively. Considering human recognition in the same situations, networks trained on the pure background without objects achieves highly reasonable recognition performance that beats humans by a large margin if only given context. However, humans still outperform networks with pure object available, which indicates networks and human beings have different mechanisms in understanding an image. Furthermore, we straightforwardly combine multiple trained networks to explore different visual cues learned by different networks. Experiments show that useful visual hints can be explicitly learned separately and then combined to achieve higher performance, which verifies the advantages of the proposed framework.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/505	Zhuotun Zhu, Lingxi Xie, Alan Yuille
What to Do Next: Modeling User Behaviors by Time-LSTM	Recently, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) solutions for recommender systems (RS) are becoming increasingly popular. The insight is that, there exist some intrinsic patterns in the sequence of users' actions, and RNN has been proved to perform excellently when modeling sequential data. In traditional tasks such as language modeling, RNN solutions usually only consider the sequential order of objects without the notion of interval. However, in RS, time intervals between users' actions are of significant importance in capturing the relations of users' actions and the traditional RNN architectures are not good at modeling them. In this paper, we propose a new LSTM variant, i.e. Time-LSTM, to model users' sequential actions. Time-LSTM equips LSTM with time gates to model time intervals. These time gates are specifically designed, so that compared to the traditional RNN solutions, Time-LSTM better captures both of users' short-term and long-term interests, so as to improve the recommendation performance. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show the superiority of the recommendation method using Time-LSTM over the traditional methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/504	Yu Zhu, Hao Li, Yikang Liao, Beidou Wang, Ziyu Guan, Haifeng Liu, Deng Cai
Dependency Exploitation: A Unified CNN-RNN Approach for Visual Emotion Recognition	Visual emotion recognition aims to associate images with appropriate emotions. There are different visual stimuli that can affect human emotion from low-level to high-level, such as color, texture, part, object, etc. However, most existing methods treat different levels of features as independent entity without having effective method for feature fusion. In this paper, we propose a unified CNN-RNN model to predict the emotion based on the fused features from different levels by exploiting the dependency among them. Our proposed architecture leverages convolutional neural network (CNN) with multiple layers to extract different levels of features with in a multi-task learning framework, in which two related loss functions are introduced to learn the feature representation. Considering the dependencies within the low-level and high-level features, a new bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN) is proposed to integrate the learned features from different layers in the CNN model. Extensive experiments on both Internet images and art photo datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with at least 7% performance improvement.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/503	Xinge Zhu, Liang Li, Weigang Zhang, Tianrong Rao, Min Xu, Qingming Huang, Dong Xu
No Learner Left Behind: On the Complexity of Teaching Multiple Learners Simultaneously	We present a theoretical study of algorithmic teaching in the setting where the teacher must use the same training set to teach multiple learners. This problem is a theoretical abstraction of the real-world classroom setting in which the teacher delivers the same lecture to academically diverse students. We define a minimax teaching criterion to guarantee the performance of the worst learner in the class. We prove that the teaching dimension increases with class diversity in general. For the classes of conjugate Bayesian learners and linear regression learners, respectively, we exhibit corresponding minimax teaching set. We then propose a method to enhance teaching by partitioning the class into sections. We present cases where the optimal partition minimizes overall teaching dimension while maintaining the guarantee on all learners. Interestingly, we show personalized education (one learner per section) is not necessarily the optimal partition. Our results generalize algorithmic teaching to multiple learners and offer insight on how to teach large classes.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/502	Xiaojin Zhu, Ji Liu, Manuel Lopes
Adaptive Hypergraph Learning for Unsupervised Feature Selection	Current unsupervised feature selection (UFS) methods learn the similarity matrix by using a simple graph which is learnt from the original data as well as is independent from the process of feature selection, and thus unable to efficiently remove the redundant/irrelevant features. To address these issues, we propose a new UFS method to jointly learn the similarity matrix and conduct both subspace learning (via learning a dynamic hypergraph) and feature selection (via a sparsity constraint). As a result, we reduce the feature dimensions using different methods (i.e., subspace learning and feature selection) from different feature spaces, and thus makes our method select the informative features effectively and robustly. We tested our method using benchmark datasets to conduct the clustering tasks using the selected features, and the experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms all the comparison methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/501	Xiaofeng Zhu, Yonghua Zhu, Shichao Zhang, Rongyao Hu, Wei He
Deep Graphical Feature Learning for Face Sketch Synthesis	The exemplar-based face sketch synthesis method generally contains two steps: neighbor selection and reconstruction weight representation. Pixel intensities are widely used as features by most of the existing exemplar-based methods, which lacks of representation ability and robustness to light variations and clutter backgrounds. We present a novel face sketch synthesis method combining generative exemplar-based method and discriminatively trained deep convolutional neural networks (dCNNs) via a deep graphical feature learning framework. Our method works in both two steps by using deep discriminative representations derived from dCNNs. Instead of using it directly, we boost its representation capability by a deep graphical feature learning framework. Finally, the optimal weights of deep representations and optimal reconstruction weights for face sketch synthesis can be obtained simultaneously. With the optimal reconstruction weights, we can synthesize high quality sketches which is robust against light variations and clutter backgrounds. Extensive experiments on public face sketch databases show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, in terms of both synthesis quality and recognition ability.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/500	Mingrui Zhu, Nannan Wang, Xinbo Gao, Jie Li
Locality Constrained Deep Supervised Hashing for Image Retrieval	Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) based deep hashing has shown its success for fast and accurate image retrieval, however directly minimizing the quantization error in deep hashing will change the distribution of DCNN features, and consequently change the similarity between the query and the retrieved images in hashing. In this paper, we propose a novel Locality-Constrained Deep Supervised Hashing. By simultaneously learning discriminative DCNN features and preserving the similarity between image pairs, the hash codes of our scheme preserves the distribution of DCNN features thus favors the accurate image retrieval.The contributions of this paper are two-fold: i) Our analysis shows that minimizing quantization error in deep hashing makes the features less discriminative which is not desirable for image retrieval; ii) We propose a Locality-Constrained Deep Supervised Hashing which preserves the similarity between image pairs in hashing.Extensive experiments on the CIFARA-10 and NUS-WIDE datasets show that our method significantly boosts the accuracy of image retrieval, especially on the CIFAR-10 dataset, the improvement is usually more than 6% in terms of the MAP measurement. Further, our method demonstrates 10 times faster than state-of-the-art methods in the training phase.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/499	Hao Zhu, Shenghua Gao
Diverse Neuron Type Selection for Convolutional Neural Networks	The activation function for neurons is a prominent element in the deep learning architecture for obtaining high performance. Inspired by neuroscience findings, we introduce and define two types of neurons with different activation functions for artificial neural networks: excitatory and inhibitory neurons, which can be adaptively selected by self-learning. Based on the definition of neurons, in the paper we not only unify the mainstream activation functions, but also discuss the complementariness among these types of neurons. In addition, through the cooperation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, we present a compositional activation function that leads to new state-of-the-art performance comparing to rectifier linear units. Finally, we hope that our framework not only gives a basic unified framework of the existing activation neurons to provide guidance for future design, but also contributes neurobiological explanations which can be treated as a window to bridge the gap between biology and computer science.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/498	Guibo Zhu, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Xu-Yao Zhang, Cheng-Lin Liu
Deep Forest: Towards An Alternative to Deep Neural Networks	In this paper, we propose gcForest, a decision tree ensemble approach with performance highly competitive to deep neural networks in a broad range of tasks. In contrast to deep neural networks which require great effort in hyper-parameter tuning, gcForest is much easier to train; even when it is applied to different data across different domains in our experiments, excellent performance can be achieved by almost same settings of hyper-parameters. The training process of gcForest is efficient, and users can control training cost according to computational resource available. The efficiency may be further enhanced because gcForest is naturally apt to parallel implementation. Furthermore, in contrast to deep neural networks which require large-scale training data, gcForest can work well even when there are only small-scale training data.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/497	Zhi-Hua Zhou, Ji Feng
Binary Linear Compression for Multi-label Classification	In multi-label classification tasks, labels are commonly related with each other. It has been well recognized that utilizing label relationship is essential to multi-label learning. One way to utilizing label relationship is to map labels to a lower-dimensional space of uncorrelated labels, where the relationship could be encoded in the mapping. Previous linear mapping methods commonly result in regression subproblems in the lower-dimensional label space. In this paper, we disclose that mappings to a low-dimensional multi-label regression problem can be worse than mapping to a classification problem, since regression requires more complex model than classification. We then propose the binary linear compression (BILC) method that results in a binary label space, leading to classification subproblems. Experiments on several multi-label datasets show that, employing classification in the embedded space results in much simpler models than regression, leading to smaller structure risk. The proposed methods are also shown to be superior to some state-of-the-art approaches.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/496	Wen-Ji Zhou, Yang Yu, Min-Ling Zhang
Tensor Completion with Side Information: A Riemannian Manifold Approach	By restricting the iterate on a nonlinear manifold, the recently proposed Riemannian optimization methods prove to be both efficient and effective in low rank tensor completion problems. However, existing methods fail to exploit the easily accessible side information, due to their format mismatch. Consequently, there is still room for improvement. To fill the gap, in this paper, a novel Riemannian model is proposed to tightly integrate the original model and the side information by overcoming their inconsistency. For this model, an efficient Riemannian conjugate gradient descent solver is devised based on a new metric that captures the curvature of the objective. Numerical experiments suggest that our method is more accurate than the state-of-the-art without compromising the efficiency.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/495	Tengfei Zhou, Hui Qian, Zebang Shen, Chao Zhang, Congfu Xu
Microblog Sentiment Classiﬁcation via Recurrent Random Walk Network Learning	Microblog Sentiment Classification (MSC) is a challenging task in microblog mining, arising in many applications such as stock price prediction and crisis management. Currently, most of the existing approaches learn the user sentiment model from their posted tweets in microblogs, which suffer from the insufficiency of discriminative tweet representation. In this paper, we consider the problem of microblog sentiment classification from the viewpoint of heterogeneous MSC network embedding. We propose a novel recurrent random walk network learning framework for the problem by exploiting both users' posted tweets and their social relations in microblogs. We then introduce the deep recurrent neural networks with random-walk layer for heterogeneous MSC network embedding, which can be trained end-to-end from the scratch. Weemploytheback-propagationmethodfortraining the proposed recurrent random walk network model. The extensive experiments on the large-scale public datasets from Twitter show that our method achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art solutions to the problem.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/494	Zhou Zhao, Hanqing Lu, Deng Cai, Xiaofei He, Yueting Zhuang
Link Prediction via Ranking Metric Dual-Level Attention Network Learning	Link prediction is a challenging problem for complex network analysis, arising in many disciplines such as social networks and telecommunication networks. Currently, many existing approaches estimate the proximity of the link endpoints for link prediction from their feature or the local neighborhood around them, which suffer from the localized view of network connections and insufficiency of discriminative feature representation. In this paper, we consider the problem of link prediction from the viewpoint of learning discriminative path-based proximity ranking metric embedding. We propose a novel ranking metric network learning framework by jointly exploiting both node-level and path-level attentional proximity of the endpoints for link prediction. We then develop the path-based dual-level reasoning attentional learning method with recurrent neural network for proximity ranking metric embedding. The extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets show that our method achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art solutions to the problem.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/493	Zhou Zhao, Ben Gao, Vincent W. Zheng, Deng Cai, Xiaofei He, Yueting Zhuang
Video Question Answering via Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Attention Networks	Open-ended video question answering is a challenging problem in visual information retrieval, which automatically generates the natural language answer from the referenced video content according to the question. However, the existing visual question answering works only focus on the static image, which may be ineffectively applied to video question answering due to the temporal dynamics of video contents. In this paper, we consider the problem of open-ended video question answering from the viewpoint of spatio-temporal attentional encoder-decoder learning framework. We propose the hierarchical spatio-temporal attention network for learning the joint representation of the dynamic video contents according to the given question. We then develop the encoder-decoder learning method with reasoning recurrent neural networks for open-ended video question answering. We construct a large-scale video question answering dataset. The extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/492	Zhou Zhao, Qifan Yang, Deng Cai, Xiaofei He, Yueting Zhuang
TUCH: Turning Cross-view Hashing into Single-view Hashing via Generative Adversarial Nets	Cross-view retrieval, which focuses on searching images as response to text queries or vice versa, has received increasing attention recently. Cross-view hashing is to efficiently solve the cross-view retrieval problem with binary hash codes. Most existing works on cross-view hashing exploit multi-view embedding method to tackle this problem, which inevitably causes the information loss in both image and text domains. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), this paper presents a new model that is able to Turn Cross-view Hashing into single-view hashing (TUCH), thus enabling the information of image to be preserved as much as possible. TUCH is a novel deep architecture that integrates a language model network T for text feature extraction, a generator network G to generate fake images from text feature and a hashing network H for learning hashing functions to generate compact binary codes. Our architecture effectively unifies joint generative adversarial learning and cross-view hashing. Extensive empirical evidence shows that our TUCH approach achieves state-of-the-art results, especially on text to image retrieval, based on image-sentences datasets, i.e. standard IAPRTC-12 and large-scale Microsoft COCO.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/491	Xin Zhao, Guiguang Ding, Yuchen Guo, Jungong Han, Yue Gao
Deep Multiple Instance Hashing for Object-based Image Retrieval	Multi-keyword query is widely supported in text search engines. However, an analogue in image retrieval systems, multi-object query, is rarely studied. Meanwhile, traditional object-based image retrieval methods often involve multiple steps separately and need expensive location labeling for detecting objects. In this work, we propose a weakly-supervised Deep Multiple Instance Hashing (DMIH) framework for object-based image retrieval. DMIH integrates object detection and hashing learning on the basis of a popular CNN model to build the end-to-end relation between a raw image and the binary hashing codes of multiple objects in it. Specifically, we cast the object detection of each object class as a binary multiple instance learning problem where instances are object proposals extracted from multi-scale convolutional feature maps. For hashing training, we sample image pairs to learn their semantic relationships in terms of hash codes of the most probable proposals for owned labels as guided by object predictors. The two objectives benefit each other in learning. DMIH outperforms state-of-the-arts on public benchmarks for object-based image retrieval and achieves promising results for multi-object queries.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/490	Wanqing Zhao, Ziyu Guan, Hangzai Luo, Jinye Peng, Jianping Fan
ContextCare: Incorporating Contextual Information Networks to Representation Learning on Medical Forum Data	Online users have generated a large amount of health-related data on medical forums and search engines. However, exploiting these rich data for orienting patient online and assisting medical checkup offline is nontrivial due to the sparseness of existing symptom-disease links, which caused by the natural and chatty expressions of symptoms. In this paper, we propose a novel and general representation learning method ContextCare for human generated health-related data, which learns the latent relationship between symptoms and diseases from the symptom-disease diagnosis network for disease prediction, disease category prediction and disease clustering. To alleviate the network sparseness, ContextCare adopts regularizations from rich contextual information networks including a symptom co-occurrence network and a disease evolution network. Therefore, our representations of symptoms and diseases incorporate knowledge from these three networks. Extensive experiments on medical forum data demonstrate that ContextCare outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in disease category prediction, disease prediction and disease clustering.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/489	Stan Zhao, Meng Jiang, Quan Yuan, Bing Qin, Ting Liu, ChengXiang Zhai
Deep Optical Flow Estimation Via Multi-Scale Correspondence Structure Learning	As an important and challenging problem in computer vision, learning based optical flow estimation aims to discover the intrinsic correspondence structure between two adjacent video frames through statistical learning. Therefore, a key issue to solve in this area is how to effectively model the multi-scale correspondence structure properties in an adaptive end-to-end learning fashion. Motivated by this observation, we propose an end-to-end multi-scale correspondence structure learning (MSCSL) approach for optical flow estimation. In principle, the proposed MSCSL approach is capable of effectively capturing the multi-scale inter-image-correlation correspondence structures within a multi-level feature space from deep learning. Moreover, the proposed MSCSL approach builds a spatial Conv-GRU neural network model to adaptively model the intrinsic dependency relationships among these multi-scale correspondence structures. Finally, the above procedures for correspondence structure learning and multi-scale dependency modeling are implemented in a unified end-to-end deep learning framework. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/488	Shanshan Zhao, Xi Li, Omar El Farouk Bourahla
Hierarchical Feature Selection with Recursive Regularization	In the big data era, the sizes of datasets have increased dramatically in terms of the number of samples, features, and classes. In particular, there exists usually a hierarchical structure among the classes. This kind of task is called hierarchical classification. Various algorithms have been developed to select informative features for flat classification. However, these algorithms ignore the semantic hyponymy in the directory of hierarchical classes, and select a uniform subset of the features for all classes. In this paper, we propose a new technique for hierarchical feature selection based on recursive regularization. This algorithm takes the hierarchical information of the class structure into account. As opposed to flat feature selection, we select different feature subsets for each node in a hierarchical tree structure using the parent-children relationships and the sibling relationships for hierarchical regularization. By imposing $\ell_{2,1}$-norm regularization to different parts of the hierarchical classes, we can learn a sparse matrix for the feature ranking of each node. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/487	Hong Zhao, Pengfei Zhu, Ping Wang, Qinghua Hu
Random Shifting for CNN: a Solution to Reduce Information Loss in Down-Sampling Layers	Down-sampling is widely adopted in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for reducing the number of network parameters while preserving the transformation invariance. However, it cannot utilize information effectively because it only adopts a fixed stride strategy, which may result in poor generalization ability and information loss. In this paper, we propose a novel random strategy to alleviate these problems by embedding random shifting in the down-sampling layers during the training process. Random shifting can be universally applied to diverse DCNN models to dynamically adjust receptive fields by shifting kernel centers on feature maps in different directions. Thus, it can generate more robust features in networks and further enhance the transformation invariance of down-sampling operators. In addition, random shifting cannot only be integrated in all down-sampling layers including strided convolutional layers and pooling layers, but also improve performance of DCNN with negligible additional computational cost. We evaluate our method in different tasks (e.g., image classification and segmentation) with various network architectures (i.e., AlexNet, FCN and DFN-MR). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/486	Gangming Zhao, Jingdong Wang, Zhaoxiang Zhang
Learning Discriminative Recommendation Systems with Side Information	Top-N recommendation systems are useful in many real world applications such as E-commerce platforms. Most previous methods produce top-N recommendations based on the observed user purchase or recommendation activities. Recently, it has been noticed that side information that describes the items can be produced from auxiliary sources and help to improve the performance of top-N recommendation systems; e.g., side information of the items can be collected from the item reviews. In this paper, we propose a joint discriminative prediction model that exploits both the partially observed user-item recommendation matrix and the item-based side information to build top-N recommendation systems. This joint model aggregates observed user-item recommendation activities to produce the missing user-item recommendation scores while simultaneously training a linear regression model to predict the user-item recommendation scores from auxiliary item features. We evaluate the proposed approach on a number of recommendation datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed joint model is very effective for producing top-N recommendation systems.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/485	Feipeng Zhao, Yuhong Guo
Tensor Based Knowledge Transfer Across Skill Categories for Robot Control	Advances in hardware and learning for control are enabling robots to perform increasingly dextrous and dynamic control tasks. These skills typically require a prohibitive amount of exploration for reinforcement learning, and so are commonly achieved by imitation learning from manual demonstration. The costly non-scalable nature of manual demonstration has motivated work into skill generalisation, e.g., through contextual policies and options. Despite good results, existing work along these lines is limited to generalising across variants of one skill such as throwing an object to different locations. In this paper we go significantly further and investigate generalisation across qualitatively different classes of control skills. In particular, we introduce a class of neural network controllers that can realise four distinct skill classes: reaching, object throwing, casting, and ball-in-cup. By factorising the weights of the neural network, we are able to extract transferrable latent skills, that enable dramatic acceleration of learning in cross-task transfer. With a suitable curriculum, this allows us to learn challenging dextrous control tasks like ball-in-cup from scratch with pure reinforcement learning.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/484	Chenyang Zhao, Timothy M. Hospedales, Freek Stulp, Olivier Sigaud
Weighted Double Q-learning	Q-learning is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm, but it can perform poorly in stochastic environments due to overestimating action values. Overestimation is due to the use of a single estimator that uses the maximum action value as an approximation for the maximum expected action value. To avoid overestimation in Q-learning, the double Q-learning algorithm was recently proposed, which uses the double estimator method. It uses two estimators from independent sets of experiences, with one estimator determining the maximizing action and the other providing the estimate of its value. Double Q-learning sometimes underestimates the action values. This paper introduces a weighted double Q-learning algorithm, which is based on the construction of the weighted double estimator, with the goal of balancing between the overestimation in the single estimator and the underestimation in the double estimator. Empirically, the new algorithm is shown to perform well on several MDP problems.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/483	Zongzhang Zhang, Zhiyuan Pan, Mykel J. Kochenderfer
Multimodal Linear Discriminant Analysis via Structural Sparsity	Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a widely used supervised dimensionality reduction technique. Even though the LDA method has many real-world applications, it has some limitations such as the single-modal problem that each class follows a normal distribution. To solve this problem, we propose a method called multimodal linear discriminant analysis (MLDA). By generalizing the between-class and within-class scatter matrices, the MLDA model can allow each data point to have its own class mean which is called the instance-specific class mean. Then in each class, data points which share the same or similar instance-specific class means are considered to form one cluster or modal. In order to learn the instance-specific class means, we use the ratio of the proposed generalized between-class scatter measure over the proposed generalized within-class scatter measure, which encourages the class separability, as a criterion. The observation that each class will have a limited number of clusters inspires us to use a structural sparse regularizor to control the number of unique instance-specific class means in each class. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MLDA method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/482	Yu Zhang, Yuan Jiang
Multi-Instance Learning with Key Instance Shift	Multi-instance learning (MIL) deals with the tasks where each example is represented by a bag of instances. A bag is positive if it contains at least one positive instance, and negative otherwise. The positive instances are also called key instances. Only bag labels are observed, whereas specific instance labels are not available in MIL. Previous studies typically assume that training and test data follow the same distribution, which may be violated in many real-world tasks. In this paper, we address the problem that the distribution of key instances varies between training and test phase. We refer to this problem as MIL with key instance shift and solve it by proposing an embedding based method MIKI. Specifically, to transform the bags into informative vectors, we propose a weighted multi-class model to select the instances with high positiveness as instance prototypes. Then we learn the importance weights for transformed bag vectors and incorporate original instance weights into them to narrow the gap between training/test distributions. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach when key instance shift occurs.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/481	Ya-Lin Zhang, Zhi-Hua Zhou
Robust Regression via Heuristic Hard Thresholding	The presence of data noise and corruptions recently invokes increasing attention on Robust Least Squares Regression (RLSR), which addresses the fundamental problem that learns reliable regression coefficients when response variables can be arbitrarily corrupted. Until now, several important challenges still cannot be handled concurrently: 1) exact recovery guarantee of regression coefficients 2) difficulty in estimating the corruption ratio parameter; and 3) scalability to massive dataset. This paper proposes a novel Robust Least squares regression algorithm via Heuristic Hard thresholding (RLHH), that concurrently addresses all the above challenges. Specifically, the algorithm alternately optimizes the regression coefficients and estimates the optimal uncorrupted set via heuristic hard thresholding without corruption ratio parameter until it converges. We also prove that our algorithm benefits from strong guarantees analogous to those of state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence rates and recovery guarantees. We provide empirical evidence to demonstrate that the effectiveness of our new method is superior to that of existing methods in the recovery of both regression coefficients and uncorrupted sets, with very competitive efficiency.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/480	Xuchao Zhang, Liang Zhao, Arnold P.

Global-residual and Local-boundary Refinement Networks for Rectifying Scene Parsing Predictions	Most of existing scene parsing methods suffer from the serious problems of both inconsistent parsing results and object boundary shift. To tackle these problems, we first propose an iterative Global-residual Refinement Network (GRN) through exploiting global contextual information to predict the parsing residuals and iteratively smoothen the inconsistent parsing labels. Furthermore, we propose a Local-boundary Refinement Network (LRN) to learn the position-adaptive propagation coefficients so that local contextual information from neighbors can be optimally captured for refining object boundaries. Finally, we cascade the proposed two refinement networks after a fully residual convolutional neural network within a uniform framework. Extensive experiments on ADE20K and Cityscapes datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness of the two refinement methods for refining scene parsing predictions.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/479	Rui Zhang, Sheng Tang, Min Lin, Jintao Li, Shuicheng Yan
Hashtag Recommendation for Multimodal Microblog Using Co-Attention Network	In microblogging services, authors can use hashtags to mark keywords or topics. Many live social media applications (e.g., microblog retrieval, classification) can gain great benefits from these manually labeled tags. However, only a small portion of microblogs contain hashtags inputed by users. Moreover, many microblog posts contain not only textual content but also images. These visual resources also provide valuable information that may not be included in the textual content. So that it can also help to recommend hashtags more accurately. Motivated by the successful use of the attention mechanism, we propose a co-attention network incorporating textual and visual information to recommend hashtags for multimodal tweets. Experimental result on the data collected from Twitter demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods using textual information only.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/478	Qi Zhang, Jiawen Wang, Haoran Huang, Xuanjing Huang, Yeyun Gong
DRLnet: Deep Difference Representation Learning Network and An Unsupervised Optimization Framework	Change detection and analysis (CDA) is an important research topic in the joint interpretation of spatial-temporal remote sensing images. The core of CDA is to effectively represent the difference and measure the difference degree between bi-temporal images. In this paper, we propose a novel difference representation learning network (DRLnet) and an effective optimization framework without any supervision. Difference measurement, difference representation learning and unsupervised clustering are combined as a single model, i.e., DRLnet, which is driven to learn clustering-friendly and discriminative difference representations (DRs) for different types of changes. Further, DRLnet is extended into a recurrent learning framework to update and reuse limited training samples and prevent the semantic gaps caused by the saltation in the number of change types from over-clustering stage to the desired one. Experimental results identify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/477	Puzhao Zhang, Maoguo Gong, Hui Zhang, Jia Liu
Adaptively Unified Semi-supervised Learning for Cross-Modal Retrieval	Motivated by the fact that both relevancy of class labels and unlabeled data can help to strengthen multi-modal correlation, this paper proposes a novel method for cross-modal retrieval. To make each sample moving to the direction of its relevant label while far away from that of its irrelevant ones, a novel dragging technique is fused into a unified linear regression model. By this way, not only the relation between embedded features and relevant class labels but also the relation between embedded features and irrelevant class labels can be exploited. Moreover, considering that some unlabeled data contain specific semantic information, a weighted regression model is designed to adaptively enlarge their contribution while weaken that of the unlabeled data with non-specific semantic information. Hence, unlabeled data can supply semantic information to enhance discriminant ability of classifier. Finally, we integrate the constraints into a joint minimization formulation and develop an efficient optimization algorithm to learn a discriminative common subspace for different modalities. Experimental results on Wiki, Pascal and NUS-WIDE datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods even when we set 20% samples without class labels.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/476	Liang Zhang, Bingpeng Ma, Jianfeng He, Guorong Li, Qingming Huang, Qi Tian
Adaptive Manifold Regularized Matrix Factorization for Data Clustering	Data clustering is the task to group the data samples into certain clusters based on the relationships of samples and structures hidden in data, and it is a fundamental and important topic in data mining and machine learning areas. In the literature, the spectral clustering is one of the most popular approaches and has many variants in recent years. However, the performance of spectral clustering is determined by the affinity matrix, which is always computed by a predefined model (e.g., Gaussian kernel function) with carefully tuned parameters combination, and may far from optimal in practice. In this paper, we propose to consider the observed data clustering as a robust matrix factorization point of view, and learn an affinity matrix simultaneously to regularize the proposed matrix factorization. The solution of the proposed adaptive manifold regularized matrix factorization (AMRMF) is reached by a novel Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier (ALM) based algorithm. The experimental results on standard clustering datasets demonstrate the superior performance over the exist alternatives.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/475	Lefei Zhang, Qian Zhang, Bo Du, Jane You, Dacheng Tao
ME-MD: An Effective Framework for Neural Machine Translation with Multiple Encoders and Decoders	The encoder-decoder neural framework is widely employed for Neural Machine Translation (NMT) with a single encoder to represent the source sentence and a single decoder to generate target words. The translation performance heavily relies on the representation ability of the encoder and the generation ability of the decoder. To further enhance NMT, we propose to extend the original encoder-decoder framework to a novel one, which has multiple encoders and decoders (ME-MD). Through this way, multiple encoders extract more diverse features to represent the source sequence and multiple decoders capture more complicated translation knowledge. Our proposed ME-MD framework is convenient to integrate heterogeneous encoders and decoders with multiple depths and multiple types. Experiment on Chinese-English translation task shows that our ME-MD system surpasses the state-of-the-art NMT system by 2.1 BLEU points and surpasses the phrase-based Moses by 7.38 BLEU points. Our framework is general and can be applied to other sequence to sequence tasks.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/474	Jinchao Zhang, Qun  Liu, Jie Zhou
A Generalized Recurrent Neural Architecture for Text Classification with Multi-Task Learning	Multi-task learning leverages potential correlations among related tasks to extract common features and yield performance gains. However, most previous works only consider simple or weak interactions, thereby failing to model complex correlations among three or more tasks. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning architecture with four types of recurrent neural layers to fuse information across multiple related tasks. The architecture is structurally flexible and considers various interactions among tasks, which can be regarded as a generalized case of many previous works. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets for text classification show that our model can significantly improve performances of related tasks with additional information from others.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/473	Honglun Zhang, Liqiang Xiao, Yongkun Wang, Yaohui Jin
User Profile Preserving Social Network Embedding	This paper addresses social network embedding, which aims to embed social network nodes, including user profile information, into a latent low-dimensional space. Most of the existing works on network embedding only consider network structure, but ignore user-generated content that could be potentially helpful in learning a better joint network representation. Different from rich node content in citation networks, user profile information in social networks is useful but noisy, sparse, and incomplete. To properly utilize this information, we propose a new algorithm called User Profile Preserving Social Network Embedding (UPP-SNE), which incorporates user profile with network structure to jointly learn a vector representation of a social network. The theme of UPP-SNE is to embed user profile information via a nonlinear mapping into a consistent subspace, where network structure is seamlessly encoded to jointly learn informative node representations. Extensive experiments on four real-world social networks show that compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method learns better social network representations and achieves substantial performance gains in node classification and clustering tasks.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/472	Daokun Zhang, Jie Yin, Xingquan Zhu, Chengqi Zhang
Deep-dense Conditional Random Fields for Object Co-segmentation	We address the problem of object co-segmentation in images. Object co-segmentation aims to segment common objects in images and has promising applications in AI agents. We solve it by proposing a co-occurrence map, which measures how likely an image region belongs to an object and also appears in other images. The co-occurrence map of an image is calculated by combining two parts: objectness scores of image regions and similarity evidences from object proposals across images. We introduce a deep-dense conditional random field framework to infer co-occurrence maps. Both similarity metric and objectness measure are learned end-to-end in a single deep network. We evaluate our method on two benchmarks and achieve competitive performance.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/471	Zehuan Yuan, Tong Lu, Yirui Wu
Fast Stochastic Variance Reduced ADMM for Stochastic Composition Optimization	We consider the stochastic composition optimization problem proposed in \cite{wang2017stochastic}, which has applications ranging from estimation to statistical and machine learning. We propose the first ADMM based algorithm named com SVR ADMM, and show that com SVR ADMM converges linearly for strongly convex and Lipschitz smooth objectives, and has a convergence rate of $O(\logS/S)$, which improves upon the $O(S^{-4/9})$ rate in \cite{wang2016accelerating} when the objective is convex and Lipschitz smooth. Moreover, com SVR ADMM possesses a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{S})$ when the objective is convex but without Lipschitz smoothness. We also conduct experiments and show that it outperforms existing algorithms.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/470	Yue Yu, Longbo Huang
Open Category Classification by Adversarial Sample Generation	In real-world classification tasks, it is difficult to collect training samples from all possible categories of the environment. Therefore, when an instance of an unseen class appears in the prediction stage, a robust classifier should be able to tell that it is from an unseen class, instead of classifying it to be any known category. In this paper, adopting the idea of adversarial learning, we propose the ASG framework for open-category classification. ASG generates positive and negative samples of seen categories in the unsupervised manner via an adversarial learning strategy. With the generated samples, ASG then learns to tell seen from unseen in the supervised manner. Experiments performed on several datasets show the effectiveness of ASG.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/469	Yang Yu, Wei-Yang Qu, Nan Li, Zimin Guo
Single-Pass PCA of Large High-Dimensional Data	Principal component analysis (PCA) is a fundamental dimension reduction tool in statistics and machine learning. For large and high-dimensional data, computing the PCA (i.e., the top singular vectors of the data matrix) becomes a challenging task. In this work, a single-pass randomized algorithm is proposed to compute PCA with only one pass over the data. It is suitable for processing extremely large and high-dimensional data stored in slow memory (hard disk) or the data generated in a streaming fashion. Experiments with synthetic and real data validate the algorithm's accuracy, which has orders of magnitude smaller error than an existing single-pass algorithm. For a set of high-dimensional data stored as a 150 GB file, the algorithm is able to compute the first 50 principal components in just 24 minutes on a typical 24-core computer, with less than 1 GB memory cost.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/468	Wenjian Yu, Yu Gu, Jian Li, Shenghua Liu, Yaohang Li
Link Prediction with Spatial and Temporal Consistency in Dynamic Networks	Dynamic networks are ubiquitous. Link prediction in dynamic networks has attracted tremendous research interests. Many models have been developed to predict links that may emerge in the immediate future from the past evolution of the networks. There are two key factors: 1) a node is more likely to form a link in the near future with another node within its close proximity, rather than with a random node; 2) a dynamic network usually evolves smoothly. Existing approaches seldom unify these two factors to strive for the spatial and temporal consistency in a dynamic network. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a link prediction model with spatial and temporal consistency (LIST), to predict links in a sequence of networks over time. LIST characterizes the network dynamics as a function of time, which integrates the spatial topology of network at each timestamp and the temporal network evolution. Comparing to existing approaches, LIST has two advantages: 1) LIST uses a generic model to express the network structure as a function of time, which makes it also suitable for a wide variety of temporal network analysis problems beyond the focus of this paper; 2) by retaining the spatial and temporal consistency, LIST yields better prediction performance. Extensive experiments on four real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the LIST model.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/467	Wenchao Yu, Wei Cheng, Charu C Aggarwal, Haifeng Chen, Wei Wang
Privileged Multi-label Learning	This paper presents privileged multi-label learning (PrML) to explore and exploit the relationship between labels in multi-label learning problems. We suggest that for each individual label, it cannot only be implicitly connected with other labels via the low-rank constraint over label predictors, but also its performance on examples can receive the explicit comments from other labels together acting as an Oracle teacher. We generate privileged label feature for each example and its individual label, and then integrate it into the framework of low-rank based multi-label learning. The proposed algorithm can therefore comprehensively explore and exploit label relationships by inheriting all the merits of privileged information and low-rank constraints. We show that PrML can be efficiently solved by dual coordinate descent algorithm using iterative optimization strategy with cheap updates. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that through privileged label features, the performance can be significantly improved and PrML is superior to several competing methods in most cases.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/466	Shan You, Chang Xu, Yunhe Wang, Chao Xu, Dacheng Tao
Learning Co-Substructures by Kernel Dependence Maximization	Modeling associations between items in a dataset is a problem that is frequently encountered in data and knowledge mining research. Most previous studies have simply applied a predefined fixed pattern for extracting the substructure of each item pair and then analyzed the associations between these substructures. Using such fixed patterns may not, however, capture the significant association. We, therefore, propose the novel machine learning task of extracting a strongly associated substructure pair (co-substructure) from each input item pair. We call this task dependent co-substructure extraction (DCSE), and formalize it as a dependence maximization problem. Then, we discuss critical issues with this task: the data sparsity problem and a huge search space. To address the data sparsity problem, we adopt the Hilbert--Schmidt independence criterion as an objective function. To improve search efficiency, we adopt the Metropolis--Hastings algorithm. We report the results of empirical evaluations, in which the proposed method is applied for acquiring and predicting narrative event pairs, an active task in the field of natural language processing.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/465	Sho Yokoi, Daichi Mochihashi, Ryo Takahashi, Naoaki Okazaki, Kentaro Inui
A Deep Neural Network for Chinese Zero Pronoun Resolution	Existing approaches for Chinese zero pronoun resolution overlook semantic information. This is because zero pronouns have no descriptive information, which results in difficulty in explicitly capturing their semantic similarities with antecedents. Moreover, when dealing with candidate antecedents, traditional systems simply take advantage of the local information of a single candidate antecedent while failing to consider the underlying information provided by the other candidates from a global perspective. To address these weaknesses, we propose a novel zero pronoun-specific neural network, which is capable of representing zero pronouns by utilizing the contextual information at the semantic level. In addition, when dealing with candidate antecedents, a two-level candidate encoder is employed to explicitly capture both the local and global information of candidate antecedents. We conduct experiments on the Chinese portion of the OntoNotes 5.0 corpus. Experimental results show that our approach substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art method in various experimental settings.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/464	Qingyu Yin, Weinan Zhang, Yu Zhang, Ting Liu
Learning Mahalanobis Distance Metric: Considering Instance Disturbance Helps	Mahalanobis distance metric takes feature weights and correlation into account in the distance computation, which can improve the performance of many similarity/dissimilarity based methods, such as kNN. Most existing distance metric learning methods obtain metric based on the raw features and side information but neglect the reliability of them. Noises or disturbances on instances will make changes on their relationships, so as to affect the learned metric.In this paper, we claim that considering disturbance of instances may help the distance metric learning approach get a robust metric, and propose the Distance metRIc learning Facilitated by disTurbances (DRIFT) approach. In DRIFT, the noise or the disturbance of each instance is learned. Therefore, the distance between each pair of (noisy) instances can be better estimated, which facilitates side information utilization and metric learning.Experiments on prediction and visualization clearly indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/463	Han-Jia Ye, De-Chuan Zhan, Xue-Min Si, Yuan Jiang
Efficient Inexact Proximal Gradient Algorithm for Nonconvex Problems	While proximal gradient algorithm is originally designed for convex optimization, several variants have been recently proposed for nonconvex problems. Among them, nmAPG [Li and Lin, 2015] is the state-of-art. However, it is inefficient when the proximal step does not have closed-form solution, or such solution exists but is expensive, as it requires more than one proximal steps to be exactly solved in each iteration. In this paper, we propose an efficient accelerate proximal gradient (niAPG) algorithm for nonconvex problems. In each iteration, it requires only one inexact (less expensive) proximal step. Convergence to a critical point is still guaranteed, and a O(1/k) convergence rate is derived. Experiments on image inpainting and matrix completion problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has comparable performance as the state-of-the-art, but is much faster.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/462	Quanming Yao, James T.

Multi-Task Deep Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Action Control	In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn multiple tasks concurrently. A new network architecture is proposed in the algorithm which reduces the number of parameters needed by more than 75% per task compared to typical single-task deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed algorithm and network fuse images with sensor data and were tested with up to 12 movement-based control tasks on a simulated Pioneer 3AT robot equipped with a camera and range sensors. Results show that the proposed algorithm and network can learn skills that are as good as the skills learned by a comparable single-task learning algorithm. Results also show that learning performance is consistent even when the number of tasks and the number of constraints on the tasks increased.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/461	Zhaoyang Yang, Kathryn Merrick, Hussein Abbass, Lianwen Jin
A Robust Noise Resistant Algorithm for POI Identification from Flickr Data	Point of Interests (POI) identification using social media data (e.g. Flickr, Microblog) is one of the most popular research topics in recent years. However, there exist large amounts of noises (POI irrelevant data) in such crowd-contributed collections. Traditional solutions to this problem is to set a global density threshold and remove the data point as noise if its density is lower than the threshold. However, the density values vary significantly among POIs. As the result, some POIs with relatively lower density could not be identified. To solve the problem, we propose a technique based on the local drastic changes of the data density. First we define the local maxima of the density function as the Urban POIs, and the gradient ascent algorithm is exploited to assign data points into different clusters. To remove noises, we incorporate the Laplacian Zero-Crossing points along the gradient ascent process as the boundaries of the POI. Points located outside the POI region are regarded as noises. Then the technique is extended into the geographical and textual joint space so that it can make use of the heterogeneous features of social media. The experimental results show the significance of the proposed approach in removing noises.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/460	Yiyang Yang, Zhiguo Gong, Qing Li, Leong Hou U, Ruichu Cai, Zhifeng Hao
Modal Consistency based Pre-Trained Multi-Model Reuse	Multi-Model Reuse is one of the prominent problems in Learnware framework, while the main issue of Multi-Model Reuse lies in the final prediction acquisition from the responses of multiple pre-trained models. Different from multi-classifiers ensemble, there are only pre-trained models rather than the whole training sets provided in Multi-Model Reuse configuration. This configuration is closer to the real applications where the reliability of each model cannot be evaluated properly. In this paper, aiming at the lack of evaluation on reliability, the potential consistency spread on different modalities is utilized. With the consistency of pre-trained models on different modalities, we propose a Pre-trained Multi-Model Reuse approach PM2R with multi-modal data, which realizes the reusability of multiple models. PM2R can combine pre-trained multi-models efficiently without re-training, and consequently no more training data storage is required. We describe the more realistic Multi-Model Reuse setting comprehensively in our paper, and point out the differences among this setting, classifier ensemble and later fusion on multi-modal learning. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of PM2R when it is compared with state-of-the-art ensemble/multi-modal learning methods under this more realistic setting.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/459	Yang Yang, De-Chuan Zhan, Xiang-Yu Guo, Yuan Jiang
Learning to Read Irregular Text with Attention Mechanisms	We present a robust end-to-end neural-based model to attentively recognize text in natural images. Particularly, we focus on accurately identifying irregular (perspectively distorted or curved) text, which has not been well addressed in the previous literature. Previous research on text reading often works with regular (horizontal and frontal) text and does not adequately generalize to processing text with perspective distortion or curving effects. Our work proposes to overcome this difficulty by introducing two learning components: (1) an auxiliary dense character detection task that helps to learn text specific visual patterns, (2) an alignment loss that provides guidance to the training of an attention model. We show with experiments that these two components are crucial for achieving fast convergence and high classification accuracy for irregular text recognition. Our model outperforms previous work on two irregular-text datasets: SVT-Perspective and CUTE80, and is also highly-competitive on several regular-text datasets containing primarily horizontal and frontal text.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/458	Xiao Yang, Dafang He, Zihan Zhou, Daniel Kifer, C.

Positive unlabeled learning via wrapper-based adaptive sampling	"Learning from positive and unlabeled data frequently occurs in applications where only a subset of positive instances is available while the rest of the data are unlabeled. In such scenarios, often the goal is to create a discriminant model that can accurately classify both positive and negative data by modelling from labeled and unlabeled instances. In this study, we propose an adaptive sampling (AdaSampling) approach that utilises prediction probabilities from a model to iteratively update the training data. Starting with equal prior probabilities for all unlabeled data, our method ""wraps"" around a predictive model to iteratively update these probabilities to distinguish positive and negative instances in unlabeled data. Subsequently, one or more robust negative set(s) can be drawn from unlabeled data, according to the likelihood of each instance being negative, to train a single classification model or ensemble of models."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/457	Pengyi Yang, Wei Liu, Jean Yang
Joint Image Emotion Classification and Distribution Learning via Deep Convolutional Neural Network	Visual sentiment analysis is attracting more and more attention with the increasing tendency to express emotions through visual contents. Recent algorithms in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) considerably advance the emotion classification, which aims to distinguish differences among emotional categories and assigns a single dominant label to each image. However, the task is inherently ambiguous since an image usually evokes multiple emotions and its annotation varies from person to person. In this work, we address the problem via label distribution learning (LDL) and develop a multi-task deep framework by jointly optimizing both classification and distribution prediction. While the proposed method prefers to the distribution dataset with annotations of different voters, the majority voting scheme is widely adopted as the ground truth in this area, and few dataset has provided multiple affective labels. Hence, we further exploit two weak forms of prior knowledge, which are expressed as similarity information between labels, to generate emotional distribution for each category. The experiments conducted on both distribution datasets, i.e., Emotion6, Flickr_LDL, Twitter_LDL, and the largest single emotion dataset, i.e., Flickr and Instagram, demonstrate the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/456	Jufeng Yang, Dongyu She, Ming Sun
Life-Stage Modeling by Customer-Manifold Embedding	A person experiences different stages throughout the life, causing dramatically varying behavior patterns. In applications such as online-shopping, it has been observed that customer behaviors are largely affected by their stages and are evolving over time. Although this phenomena has been recognized previously, very few studies tried to model the life-stage and make use of it. In this paper, we propose to discover a latent space, called customer-manifold, on which a position corresponds to a customer stage. The customer-manifold allows us to train a static prediction model that captures dynamic customer behavior patterns. We further embed the learned customer-manifold into a neural network model as a hidden layer output, resulting in an efficient and accurate customer behavior prediction system. We apply this system to online-shopping recommendation. Experiments in real world data show that taking customer-manifold into account can improve the performance of the recommender system. Moreover, visualization of the customer-manifold space may also be helpful to understand the evolutionary customer behaviors.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/455	Jing-Wen Yang, Yang Yu, Xiao-Peng Zhang
Learning Discriminative Correlation Subspace for Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation	Domain adaptation aims to reduce the effort on collecting and annotating target data by leveraging knowledge from a different source domain. The domain adaptation problem will become extremely challenging when the feature spaces of the source and target domains are different, which is also known as the heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA) problem. In this paper, we propose a novel HDA method to find the optimal discriminative correlation subspace for the source and target data. The discriminative correlation subspace is inherited from the canonical correlation subspace between the source and target data, and is further optimized to maximize the discriminative ability for the target domain classifier. We formulate a joint objective in order to simultaneously learn the discriminative correlation subspace and the target domain classifier. We then apply an alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) algorithm to address the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/454	Yuguang Yan, Wen Li, Michael Ng, Mingkui Tan, Hanrui Wu, Huaqing Min, Qingyao Wu
Predicting Human Interaction via Relative Attention Model	Predicting human interaction is challenging as the on-going activity has to be inferred based on a partially observed video. Essentially, a good algorithm should effectively model the mutual influence between the two interacting subjects. Also, only a small region in the scene is discriminative for identifying the on-going interaction. In this work, we propose a relative attention model to explicitly address these difficulties. Built on a tri-coupled deep recurrent structure representing both interacting subjects and global interaction status, the proposed network collects spatio-temporal information from each subject, rectified with global interaction information, yielding effective interaction representation. Moreover, the proposed network also unifies an attention module to assign higher importance to the regions which are relevant to the on-going action. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two public datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed relative attention network successfully predicts informative regions between interacting subjects, which in turn yields superior human interaction prediction accuracy.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/453	Yichao Yan, Bingbing Ni, Xiaokang Yang
Semi-Supervised Deep Hashing with a Bipartite Graph	Recently, deep learning has been successfully applied to the problem of hashing, yielding remarkable performance compared to traditional methods with hand-crafted features. However, most of existing deep hashing methods are designed for the supervised scenario and require a large number of labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised hashing method for image retrieval, named Deep Hashing with a Bipartite Graph (DHBG), to simultaneously learn embeddings, features and hash codes. More specifically, we construct a bipartite graph to discover the underlying structure of data, based on which an embedding is generated for each instance. Then, we feed raw pixels as well as embeddings to a deep neural network, and concatenate the resulting features to determine the hash code. Compared to existing methods, DHBG is a universal framework that is able to utilize various types of graphs and losses. Furthermore, we propose an inductive variant of DHBG to support out-of-sample extensions. Experimental results on real datasets show that our DHBG outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/452	Xinyu Yan, Lijun Zhang, Wu-Jun Li
FolkPopularityRank: Tag Recommendation for Enhancing Social Popularity using Text Tags in Content Sharing Services	In this study, we address two emerging yet challenging problems in social media: (1) scoring the text tags in terms of the influence to the numbers of views, comments, and favorite ratings of images and videos on content sharing services, and (2) recommending additional tags to increase such popularity-related numbers. For these purposes, we present the FolkPopularityRank algorithm, which can score text tags based on their ability to influence the popularity-related numbers. The FolkPopularityRank algorithm is inspired by the PageRank and FolkRank algorithms but the scores of the tags are calculated not only by the co-occurrence of the tags but also by considering the popularity-related numbers of the content. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to recommending tags that can enhance popularity attributes of social media. We conducted extensive experiments with about 1,000 images. We uploaded the photos with the recommended tags along with the original tags to Flickr as a real test, and obtained very promising results.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/451	Toshihiko Yamasaki, Jiani Hu, Shumpei Sano, Kiyoharu Aizawa
When Does Label Propagation Fail? A View from a Network Generative Model	What kinds of data does Label Propagation (LP) work best on? Can we justify the solution of LP from a theoretical standpoint? LP is a semi-supervised learning algorithm that is widely used to predict unobserved node labels on a network (e.g., user's gender on an SNS). Despite its importance, its theoretical properties remain mostly unexplored. In this paper, we answer the above questions by interpreting LP from a statistical viewpoint. As our main result, we identify the network generative model behind the discretized version of LP (DLP), and we show that under specific conditions the solution of DLP is equal to the maximum {\it a posteriori} estimate of that generative model. Our main result reveals the critical limitations of LP. Specifically, we discover that LP would not work best on networks with (1) disassortative node labels, (2) clusters having different edge densities, (3) non-uniform label distributions, or (4) unreliable node labels provided. Our experiments under a variety of settings support our theoretical results.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/450	Yuto Yamaguchi, Kohei Hayashi
Tensor Decomposition with Missing Indices	How can we decompose a data tensor if the indices are partially missing?Tensor decomposition is a fundamental tool to analyze the tensor data.Suppose, for example, we have a 3rd-order tensor X where each element Xijk takes 1 if user i posts word j at location k on Twitter.Standard tensor decomposition expects all the indices are observed but, in some tweets, location k can be missing.In this paper, we study a tensor decomposition problem where the indices (i, j, or k) of some observed elements are partially missing.Towards the problem, we propose a probabilistic tensor decomposition model that handles missing indices as latent variables.To infer them, we derive an algorithm based on stochastic variational inference, which enables to leverage the information from the incomplete data scalably. The experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy in the tensor completion task than baselines that cannot handle missing indices.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/449	Yuto Yamaguchi, Kohei Hayashi
Multiple Indefinite Kernel Learning for Feature Selection	Multiple kernel learning for feature selection (MKL-FS) utilizes kernels to explore complex properties of features and performs better in embedded methods. However, the kernels in MKL-FS are generally limited to be positive definite. In fact, indefinite kernels often emerge in actual applications and can achieve better empirical performance. But due to the non-convexity of indefinite kernels, existing MKL-FS methods are usually inapplicable and the corresponding research is also relatively little. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple indefinite kernel feature selection method (MIK-FS) based on the primal framework of indefinite kernel support vector machine (IKSVM), which applies an indefinite base kernel for each feature and then exerts an l1-norm constraint on kernel combination coefficients to select features automatically. A two-stage algorithm is further presented to optimize the coefficients of IKSVM and kernel combination alternately. In the algorithm, we reformulate the non-convex optimization problem of primal IKSVM as a difference of convex functions (DC) programming and transform the non-convex problem into a convex one with the affine minorization approximation. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MIK-FS is superior to some related state-of-the-art methods in both feature selection and classification performance.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/448	Hui Xue, Yu Song, Hai-Ming Xu
Deep Matrix Factorization Models for Recommender Systems	Recommender systems usually make personalized recommendation with user-item interaction ratings, implicit feedback and auxiliary information. Matrix factorization is the basic idea to predict a personalized ranking over a set of items for an individual user with the similarities among users and items. In this paper, we propose a novel matrix factorization model with neural network architecture. Firstly, we construct a user-item matrix with explicit ratings and non-preference implicit feedback. With this matrix as the input, we present a deep structure learning architecture to learn a common low dimensional space for the representations of users and items. Secondly, we design a new loss function based on binary cross entropy, in which we consider both explicit ratings and implicit feedback for a better optimization. The experimental results show the effectiveness of both our proposed model and the loss function. On several benchmark datasets, our model outperformed other state-of-the-art methods. We also conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance within different experimental settings.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/447	Hong-Jian Xue, Xinyu Dai, Jianbing Zhang, Shujian Huang, Jiajun Chen
Tag-Aware Personalized Recommendation Using a Hybrid Deep Model	Recently, many efforts have been put into tag-aware personalized recommendation. However, due to uncontrolled vocabularies, social tags are usually redundant, sparse, and ambiguous. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network approach to solve this problem by mapping the tag-based user and item profiles to an abstract deep feature space, where the deep-semantic similarities between users and their target items (resp., irrelevant items) are maximized (resp., minimized). To ensure the scalability in practice, we further propose to improve this model's training efficiency by using hybrid deep learning and negative sampling. Experimental results show that our approach can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines in tag-aware personalized recommendation (3.8 times better than the best baseline), and that using hybrid deep learning and negative sampling can dramatically enhance the model's training efficiency (hundreds of times quicker), while maintaining similar (and sometimes even better) training quality and recommendation performance.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/446	Zhenghua Xu, Thomas Lukasiewicz, Cheng Chen, Yishu Miao, Xiangwu Meng
Stochastic Online Anomaly Analysis for Streaming Time Series	Identifying patterns in time series that exhibit anomalous behavior is of increasing importance in many domains, such as financial and Web data analysis. In real applications, time series data often arrive continuously, and usually only a single scan is allowed through the data. Batch learning and retrospective segmentation methods would not be well applicable to such scenarios. In this paper, we present an online nonparametric Bayesian method OLAD for anomaly analysis in streaming time series. Moreover, we develop a novel and efficient online learning approach for the OLAD model based on stochastic gradient descent. The proposed method can effectively learn the underlying dynamics of anomaly-contaminated heavy-tailed time series and identify potential anomalous events. Empirical analysis on real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/445	Zhao Xu, Kristian Kersting, Lorenzo von Ritter
Multi-Positive and Unlabeled Learning	The positive and unlabeled (PU) learning problem focuses on learning a classifier from positive and unlabeled data. Some methods have been developed to solve the PU learning problem. However, they are often limited in practical applications, since only binary classes are involved and cannot easily be adapted to multi-class data. Here we propose a one-step method that directly enables multi-class model to be trained using the given input multi-class data and that predicts the label based on the model decision. Specifically, we construct different convex loss functions for labeled and unlabeled data to learn a discriminant function F. The theoretical analysis on the generalization error bound shows that it is no worse than k√k times of the fully supervised multi-class classification methods when the size of the data in k classes is of the same order. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate the significance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in synthetic and real-world datasets.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/444	Yixing Xu, Chang Xu, Chao Xu, Dacheng Tao
Incomplete Label Distribution Learning	Label distribution learning (LDL) assumes labels can be associated to an instance to some degree, thus it can learn the relevance of a label to a particular instance. Although LDL has got successful practical applications, one problem with existing LDL methods is that they are designed for data with \emph{complete} supervised information, while in reality, annotation information may be \emph{incomplete}, because assigning each label a real value to indicate its association with a particular instance will result in large cost in labor and time. In this paper, we will solve LDL problem when given \emph{incomplete} supervised information. We propose an objective based on trace norm minimization to exploit the correlation between labels. We develop a proximal gradient descend algorithm and an algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposal.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/443	Miao Xu, Zhi-Hua Zhou
Feature Selection via Scaling Factor Integrated Multi-Class Support Vector Machines	In data mining, we often encounter high dimensional and noisy features, which may not only increase the load of computational resources but also result in the problem of model overfitting. Feature selection is often adopted to address this issue. In this paper, we propose a novel feature selection method based on multi-class SVM, which introduces the scaling factor with a flexible parameter to renewedly adjust the distribution of feature weights and select the most discriminative features. Concretely, the proposed method designs a scaling factor with p/2 power to control the distribution of weights adaptively and search optimal sparsity of weighting matrix. In addition, to solve the proposed model, we provide an alternative and iterative optimization method. It not only makes solutions of weighting matrix and scaling factor independently, but also provides a better way to address the problem of solving L2,0-norm. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on six datasets to demonstrate that this work can obtain better performance compared with a number of existing state-of-the-art multi-class feature selection methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/442	Jinglin Xu, Feiping Nie, Junwei Han
Multi-view Feature Learning with Discriminative Regularization	More and more multi-view data which can capture rich information from heterogeneous features are widely used in real world applications. How to integrate different types of features, and how to learn low dimensional and discriminative information from high dimensional data are two main challenges. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-view feature learning framework, which is regularized by discriminative information and obtains a feature learning model that contains multiple discriminative feature weighting matrices for different views, and then yields multiple low dimensional features used for subsequent multi-view clustering. To optimize the formulated objective function, we transform the proposed framework into a trace optimization problem which obtains the global solution in a closed form. Experimental evaluations on four widely used datasets and comparisons with a number of state-of-the-art multi-view clustering algorithms demonstrate the superiority of the proposed work.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/441	Jinglin Xu, Junwei Han, Feiping Nie
Multi-Class Support Vector Machine via Maximizing Multi-Class Margins	Support Vector Machine (SVM) is originally proposed as a binary classification model, and it has already achieved great success in different applications. In reality, it is more often to solve a problem which has more than two classes. So, it is natural to extend SVM to a multi-class classifier. There have been many works proposed to construct a multi-class classifier based on binary SVM, such as one versus all strategy, one versus one strategy and Weston's multi-class SVM. One versus all strategy and one versus one strategy split the multi-class problem to multiple binary classification subproblems, and we need to train multiple binary classifiers. Weston's multi-class SVM is formed by ensuring risk constraints and imposing a specific regularization, like Frobenius norm. It is not derived by maximizing the margin between hyperplane and training data which is the motivation in SVM. In this paper, we propose a multi-class SVM model from the perspective of maximizing margin between training points and hyperplane, and analyze the relation between our model and other related methods. In the experiment, it shows that our model can get better or compared results when comparing with other related methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/440	Jie Xu, Xianglong Liu, Zhouyuan Huo, Cheng Deng, Feiping Nie, Heng Huang
Linear Manifold Regularization with Adaptive Graph for Semi-supervised Dimensionality Reduction	Many previous graph-based methods perform dimensionality reduction on a pre-defined graph. However, due to the noise and redundant information in the original data, the pre-defined graph has no clear structure and may not be appropriate for the subsequent task. To overcome the drawbacks, in this paper, we propose a novel approach called linear manifold regularization with adaptive graph (LMRAG) for semi-supervised dimensionality reduction. LMRAG directly incorporates the graph construction into the objective function, thus the projection matrix and the optimal graph can be simultaneously optimized. Due to the structure constraint, the learned graph is sparse and has clear structure. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/439	Kai Xiong, Feiping Nie, Junwei Han
Image-embodied Knowledge Representation Learning	Entity images could provide significant visual information for knowledge representation learning. Most conventional methods learn knowledge representations merely from structured triples, ignoring rich visual information extracted from entity images. In this paper, we propose a novel Image-embodied Knowledge Representation Learning model (IKRL), where knowledge representations are learned with both triple facts and images. More specifically, we first construct representations for all images of an entity with a neural image encoder. These image representations are then integrated into an aggregated image-based representation via an attention-based method. We evaluate our IKRL models on knowledge graph completion and triple classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our models outperform all baselines on both tasks, which indicates the significance of visual information for knowledge representations and the capability of our models in learning knowledge representations with images.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/438	Ruobing Xie, Zhiyuan Liu, Huanbo Luan, Maosong Sun
Dynamic Multi-View Hashing for Online Image Retrieval	Advanced hashing technique is essential to facilitate effective large scale online image organization and retrieval, where image contents could be frequently changed. Traditional multi-view hashing methods are developed based on batch-based learning, which leads to very expensive updating cost. Meanwhile, existing online hashing methods mainly focus on single-view data and thus can not achieve promising performance when searching real online images, which are multiple view based data. Further, both types of hashing methods can only produce hash code with fixed length. Consequently they suffer from limited capability to comprehensive characterization of streaming image data in the real world. In this paper, we propose dynamic multi-view hashing (DMVH), which can adaptively augment hash codes according to dynamic changes of image. Meanwhile, DMVH leverages online learning to generate hash codes. It can increase the code length when current code is not able to represent new images effectively. Moreover, to gain further improvement on overall performance, each view is assigned with a weight, which can be efficiently updated during the online learning process. In order to avoid the frequent updating of code length and view weights, an intelligent buffering scheme is also specifically designed to preserve significant data to maintain good effectiveness of DMVH. Experimental results on two real-world image datasets demonstrate superior performance of DWVH over several state-of-the-art hashing methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/437	Liang Xie, Jialie Shen, Jungong Han, Lei Zhu, Ling Shao
SVD-free Convex-Concave Approaches for Nuclear Norm Regularization	Minimizing a convex function of matrices regularized by the nuclear norm arises in many applications such as collaborative filtering and multi-task learning. In this paper, we study the general setting where the convex function could be non-smooth. When the size of the data matrix, denoted by m x n, is very large, existing optimization methods are inefficient because in each iteration, they need to perform a singular value decomposition (SVD) which takes O(m^2 n) time. To reduce the computation cost, we exploit the dual characterization of the nuclear norm to introduce a convex-concave optimization problem and design a subgradient-based algorithm without performing SVD. In each iteration, the proposed algorithm only computes the largest singular vector, reducing the time complexity from O(m^2 n) to O(mn). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SVD-free convex optimization approach for nuclear-norm regularized problems that does not rely on the smoothness assumption. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed algorithm converges at an optimal O(1/\sqrt{T}) rate where T is the number of iterations. We also extend our algorithm to the stochastic case where only stochastic subgradients of the convex function are available and a special case that contains an additional non-smooth regularizer (e.g., L1 norm regularizer). We conduct experiments on robust low-rank matrix approximation and link prediction to demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/436	Yichi Xiao, Zhe Li, Tianbao Yang, Lijun Zhang
Attentional Factorization Machines: Learning the Weight of Feature Interactions via Attention Networks	Factorization Machines (FMs) are a supervised learning approach that enhances the linear regression model by incorporating the second-order feature interactions. Despite effectiveness, FM can be hindered by its modelling of all feature interactions with the same weight, as not all feature interactions are equally useful and predictive. For example, the interactions with useless features may even introduce noises and adversely degrade the performance. In this work, we improve FM by discriminating the importance of different feature interactions. We propose a novel model named Attentional Factorization Machine (AFM), which learns the importance of each feature interaction from data via a neural attention network. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AFM. Empirically, it is shown on regression task AFM betters FM with a 8.6% relative improvement, and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning methods Wide&Deep [Cheng et al., 2016] and DeepCross [Shan et al., 2016] with a much simpler structure and fewer model parameters. Our implementation of AFM is publicly available at: https://github.com/hexiangnan/attentional_factorization_machine	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/435	Jun Xiao, Hao Ye, Xiangnan He, Hanwang Zhang, Fei Wu, Tat-Seng Chua
Dual Inference for Machine Learning	Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of machine learning in solving artificial intelligence (AI) tasks in many domains, including translation, speech, image, etc. Within these domains, AI tasks are usually not independent. As a specific type of relationship, structural duality does exist between many pairs of AI tasks, such as translation from one language to another vs. its opposite direction, speech recognition vs. speech synthetization, image classification vs. image generation, etc. The importance of such duality has been magnified by some recent studies, which revealed that it can boost the learning of two tasks in the dual form. However, there has been little investigation on how to leverage this invaluable relationship into the inference stage of AI tasks. In this paper, we propose a general framework of dual inference which can take advantage of both existing models from two dual tasks, without re-training, to conduct inference for one individual task. Empirical studies on three pairs of specific dual tasks, including machine translation, sentiment analysis, and image processing have illustrated that dual inference can significantly improve the performance of each of individual tasks.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/434	Yingce Xia, Jiang Bian, Tao Qin, Nenghai Yu, Tie-Yan Liu
Query-Driven Discovery of Anomalous Subgraphs in Attributed Graphs	For a detection problem, a user often has some prior knowledge about the structure-specific subgraphs of interest, but few traditional approaches are capable of employing this knowledge. The main technical challenge is that few approaches can efficiently model the space of connected subgraphs that are isomorphic to a query graph. We present a novel, efficient approach for optimizing a generic nonlinear cost function subject to a query-specific structural constraint. Our approach enjoys strong theoretical guarantees on the convergence of a nearly optimal solution and a low time complexity. For the case study, we specialize the nonlinear function to several well-known graph scan statistics for anomalous subgraph discovery. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our method is superior to state-of-the-art methods in several real-world anomaly detection tasks.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/433	Nannan Wu, Feng Chen, Jianxin Li, Jinpeng Huai, Bo Li
Sequence Prediction with Unlabeled Data by Reward Function Learning	Reinforcement learning (RL), which has been successfully applied to sequence prediction, introduces \textit{reward} as sequence-level supervision signal to evaluate the quality of a generated sequence. Existing RL approaches use the ground-truth sequence to define reward, which limits the application of RL techniques to labeled data. Since labeled data is usually scarce and/or costly to collect, it is desirable to leverage large-scale unlabeled data. In this paper, we extend existing RL methods for sequence prediction to exploit unlabeled data. We propose to learn the reward function from labeled data and use the predicted reward as \textit{pseudo reward} for unlabeled data so that we can learn from unlabeled data using the pseudo reward. To get good pseudo reward on unlabeled data, we propose a RNN-based reward network with attention mechanism, trained with purposely biased data distribution. Experiments show that the pseudo reward can provide good supervision and guide the learning process on unlabeled data. We observe significant improvements on both neural machine translation and text summarization.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/432	Lijun Wu, Li Zhao, Tao Qin, Jianhuang Lai, Tie-Yan Liu
Deep Context: A Neural Language Model for Large-scale Networked Documents	We propose a scalable neural language model that leverages the links between documents to learn the deep context of documents. Our model, Deep Context Vector, takes advantage of distributed representations to exploit the word order in document sentences, as well as the semantic connections among linked documents in a document network. We evaluate our model on large-scale data collections that include Wikipedia pages, and scientific and legal citations networks. We demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency on document classification and link prediction tasks.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/431	Hao Wu, Kristina Lerman
Modeling Trajectories with Recurrent Neural Networks	Modeling trajectory data is a building block for many smart-mobility initiatives. Existing approaches apply shallow models such as Markov chain and inverse reinforcement learning to model trajectories, which cannot capture the long-term dependencies. On the other hand, deep models such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have demonstrated their strength of modeling variable length sequences. However, directly adopting RNN to model trajectories is not appropriate because of the unique topological constraints faced by trajectories. Motivated by these findings, we design two RNN-based models which can make full advantage of the strength of RNN to capture variable length sequence and meanwhile to address the constraints of topological structure on trajectory modeling. Our experimental study based on real taxi trajectory datasets shows that both of our approaches largely outperform the existing approaches.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/430	Hao Wu, Ziyang Chen, Weiwei Sun, Baihua Zheng, Wei Wang
Unsupervised Deep Video Hashing with Balanced Rotation	Recently, hashing video contents for fast retrieval has received increasing attention due to the enormous growth of online videos. As the extension of image hashing techniques, traditional video hashing methods mainly focus on seeking the appropriate video features but pay little attention to how the video-specific features can be leveraged to achieve optimal binarization. In this paper, an end-to-end hashing framework, namely Unsupervised Deep Video Hashing (UDVH), is proposed, where feature extraction, balanced code learning and hash function learning are integrated and optimized in a self-taught manner. Particularly, distinguished from previous work, our framework enjoys two novelties: 1) an unsupervised hashing method that integrates the feature clustering and feature binarization, enabling the neighborhood structure to be preserved in the binary space; 2) a smart rotation applied to the video-specific features that are widely spread in the low-dimensional space such that the variance of dimensions can be balanced, thus generating more effective hash codes. Extensive experiments have been performed on two real-world datasets and the results demonstrate its superiority, compared to the state-of-the-art video hashing methods. To bootstrap further developments, the source code will be made publically available.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/429	Gengshen Wu, Li Liu, Yuchen Guo, Guiguang Ding, Jungong Han, Jialie Shen, Ling Shao
Discriminant Tensor Dictionary Learning with Neighbor Uncorrelation for Image Set Based Classification	Image set based classification (ISC) has attracted lots of research interest in recent years. Several ISC methods have been developed, and dictionary learning technique based methods obtain state-of-the-art performance. However, existing ISC methods usually transform the image sample of a set into a vector for subsequent processing, which breaks the inherent spatial structure of image sample and the set. In this paper, we utilize tensor to model an image set with two spatial modes and one set mode, which can fully explore the intrinsic structure of image set. We propose a novel ISC approach, named discriminant tensor dictionary learning with neighbor uncorrelation (DTDLNU), which jointly learns two spatial dictionaries and one set dictionary. The spatial and set dictionaries are composed by set-specific sub-dictionaries corresponding to the class labels, such that the reconstruction error is discriminative. To obtain dictionaries with favorable discriminative power, DTDLNU designs a neighbor-uncorrelated discriminant tensor dictionary term, which minimizes the within-class scatter of the training sets in the projected tensor space and reduces tensor dictionary correlation among set-specific sub-dictionaries corresponding to neighbor sets from different classes. Experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DTDLNU.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/428	Fei Wu, Xiao-Yuan Jing, Wangmeng Zuo, Ruiping Wang, Xiaoke Zhu
Sequential Prediction of Social Media Popularity with Deep Temporal Context Networks	Prediction of popularity has profound impact for social media, since it offers opportunities to reveal individual preference and public attention from evolutionary social systems. Previous research, although achieves promising results, neglects one distinctive characteristic of social data, i.e., sequentiality. For example, the popularity of online content is generated over time with sequential post streams of social media. To investigate the sequential prediction of popularity, we propose a novel prediction framework called Deep Temporal Context Networks (DTCN) by incorporating both temporal context and temporal attention into account. Our DTCN contains three main components, from embedding, learning to predicting. With a joint embedding network, we obtain a unified deep representation of multi-modal user-post data in a common embedding space. Then, based on the embedded data sequence over time, temporal context learning attempts to recurrently learn two adaptive temporal contexts for sequential popularity. Finally, a novel temporal attention is designed to predict new popularity (the popularity of a new user-post pair) with temporal coherence across multiple time-scales. Experiments on our released image dataset with about 600K Flickr photos demonstrate that DTCN outperforms state-of-the-art deep prediction algorithms, with an average of 21.51% relative performance improvement in the popularity prediction (Spearman Ranking Correlation).	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/427	Bo Wu, Wen-Huang Cheng, Yongdong Zhang, Qiushi Huang, Jintao Li, Tao Mei
Learning from Demonstrations with High-Level Side Information	We consider the problem of learning from demonstration, where extra side information about the demonstration is encoded as a co-safe linear temporal logic formula. We address two known limitations of existing methods that do not account for such side information. First, the policies that result from existing methods, while matching the expected features or likelihood of the demonstrations, may still be in conflict with high-level objectives not explicit in the demonstration trajectories. Second, existing methods fail to provide a priori guarantees on the out-of-sample generalization performance with respect to such high-level goals. This lack of formal guarantees can prevent the application of learning from demonstration to safety-critical systems, especially when inference to state space regions with poor demonstration coverage is required. In this work, we show that side information, when explicitly taken into account, indeed improves the performance and safety of the learned policy with respect to task implementation. Moreover, we describe an automated procedure to systematically generate the features that encode side information expressed in temporal logic.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/426	Min Wen, Ivan Papusha, Ufuk Topcu
Deep Descriptor Transforming for Image Co-Localization	Reusable model design becomes desirable with the rapid expansion of machine learning applications. In this paper, we focus on the reusability of pre-trained deep convolutional models. Specifically, different from treating pre-trained models as feature extractors, we reveal more treasures beneath convolutional layers, i.e., the convolutional activations could act as a detector for the common object in the image co-localization problem. We propose a simple but effective method, named Deep Descriptor Transforming (DDT), for evaluating the correlations of descriptors and then obtaining the category-consistent regions, which can accurately locate the common object in a set of images. Empirical studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed DDT method. On benchmark image co-localization datasets, DDT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Moreover, DDT also demonstrates good generalization ability for unseen categories and robustness for dealing with noisy data.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/425	Xiu-Shen Wei, Chen-Lin Zhang, Yao Li, Chen-Wei Xie, Jianxin Wu, Chunhua Shen, Zhi-Hua Zhou
Group-wise Deep Co-saliency Detection	In this paper, we propose an end-to-end group-wise deep co-saliency detection approach to address the co-salient object discovery problem based on the fully convolutional network (FCN) with group input and group output. The proposed approach captures the group-wise interaction information for group images by learning a semantics-aware image representation based on a convolutional neural network, which adaptively learns the group-wise features for co-saliency detection. Furthermore, the proposed approach discovers the collaborative and interactive relationships between group-wise feature representation and single-image individual feature representation, and model this in a collaborative learning framework. Finally, we set up a unified end-to-end deep learning scheme to jointly optimize the process of group-wise feature representation learning and the collaborative learning, leading to more reliable and robust co-saliency detection results. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/424	Lina Wei, Shanshan Zhao, Omar El Farouk Bourahla, Xi Li, Fei Wu
Supervised Deep Features for Software Functional Clone Detection by Exploiting Lexical and Syntactical Information in Source Code	Software clone detection, aiming at identifying out code fragments with similar functionalities, has played an important role in software maintenance and evolution. Many clone detection approaches have been proposed. However, most of them represent source codes with hand-crafted features using lexical or syntactical information, or unsupervised deep features, which makes it difficult to detect the functional clone pairs, i.e., pieces of codes with similar functionality but differing in both syntactical and lexical level. In this paper, we address the software functional clone detection problem by learning supervised deep features. We formulate the clone detection as a supervised learning to hash problem and propose an end-to-end deep feature learning framework called CDLH for functional clone detection. Such framework learns hash codes by exploiting the lexical and syntactical information for fast computation of functional similarity between code fragments. Experiments on software clone detection benchmarks indicate that the CDLH approach is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in software functional clone detection.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/423	Huihui Wei, Ming Li
Improving Reinforcement Learning with Confidence-Based Demonstrations	Reinforcement learning has had many successes, but in practice it often requires significant amounts of data to learn high-performing policies. One common way to improve learning is to allow a trained (source) agent to assist a new (target) agent. The goals in this setting are to 1) improve the target agent's performance, relative to learning unaided, and 2) allow the target agent to outperform the source agent. Our approach leverages source agent demonstrations, removing any requirements on the source agent's learning algorithm or representation. The target agent then estimates the source agent's policy and improves upon it. The key contribution of this work is to show that leveraging the target agent's uncertainty in the source agent's policy can significantly improve learning in two complex simulated domains, Keepaway and Mario.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/422	Zhaodong Wang, Matthew E.

Doubly Sparsifying Network	We propose the doubly sparsifying network (DSN), by drawing inspirations from the double sparsity model for dictionary learning. DSN emphasizes the joint utilization of both the problem structure and the parameter structure. It simultaneously sparsifies the output features and the learned model parameters, under one unified framework. DSN enjoys intuitive model interpretation, compact model size and low complexity. We compare DSN against a few carefully-designed baselines, to verify its consistently superior performance in a wide range of settings. Encouraged by its robustness to insufficient training data, we explore the applicability of DSN in brain signal processing that has been a challenging interdisciplinary area. DSN is evaluated for two mainstream tasks, electroencephalographic (EEG) signal classification and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response prediction, both achieving promising results.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/421	Zhangyang Wang, Shuai Huang, Jiayu Zhou, Thomas S.

On Gleaning Knowledge from Multiple Domains for Active Learning	How can a doctor diagnose new diseases with little historical knowledge, which are emerging over time? Active learning is a promising way to address the problem by querying the most informative samples. Since the diagnosed cases for new disease are very limited, gleaning knowledge from other domains (classical prescriptions) to prevent the bias of active leaning would be vital for accurate diagnosis. In this paper, a framework that attempts to glean knowledge from multiple domains for active learning by querying the most uncertain and representative samples from the target domain and calculating the importance weights for re-weighting the source data in a single unified formulation is proposed. The weights are optimized by both a supervised classifier and distribution matching between the source domain and target domain with maximum mean discrepancy. Besides, a multiple domains active learning method is designed based on the proposed framework as an example. The proposed method is verified with newsgroups and handwritten digits data recognition tasks, where it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/420	Zengmao Wang, Bo Du, Lefei Zhang, Liangpei Zhang, Ruimin Hu, Dacheng Tao
Approximate Large-scale Multiple Kernel k-means Using Deep Neural Network	Multiple kernel clustering (MKC) algorithms have been extensively studied and applied to various applications. Although they demonstrate great success in both the theoretical aspects and applications, existing MKC algorithms cannot be applied to large-scale clustering tasks due to: i) the heavy computational cost to calculate the base kernels; and ii) insufficient memory to load the kernel matrices. In this paper, we propose an approximate algorithm to overcome these issues, and to make it be applicable to large-scale applications. Specifically, our algorithm trains a deep neural network to regress the indicating matrix generated by MKC algorithms on a small subset, and then obtains the approximate indicating matrix of the whole data set using the trained network, and finally performs the $k$-means on the output of our network. By mapping features into indicating matrix directly, our algorithm avoids computing the full kernel matrices, which dramatically decreases the memory requirement. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm consumes less time than most comparatively similar algorithms, while it achieves comparable performance with MKC algorithms.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/419	Yueqing Wang, Xinwang Liu, Yong Dou, Rongchun Li
Multiple Kernel Clustering Framework with Improved Kernels	Multiple kernel clustering (MKC) algorithms have been successfully applied into various applications. However, these successes are largely dependent on the quality of pre-defined base kernels, which cannot be guaranteed in practical applications. This may adversely affect the clustering performance. To address this issue, we propose a simple while effective framework to adaptively improve the quality of these base kernels. Under our framework, we instantiate three MKC algorithms based on the widely used multiple kernel $k$-means clustering (MKKM), MKKM with matrix-induced regularization (MKKM-MR) and co-regularized multi-view spectral clustering (CRSC). After that, we design the corresponding algorithms with proved convergence to solve the resultant optimization problems. To the best of our knowledge, our framework fills the gap between kernel adaption and clustering procedure for the first time in the literature and is readily extendable. Extensive experimental research has been conducted on 7 MKC benchmarks. As is shown, our algorithms consistently and significantly improve the performance of the base MKC algorithms, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Meanwhile, our framework shows better performance than compared ones with imperfect kernels.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/418	Yueqing Wang, Xinwang Liu, Yong Dou, Rongchun Li
Fast Change Point Detection on Dynamic Social Networks	A number of real world problems in many domains (e.g. sociology, biology, political science and communication networks) can be modeled as dynamic networks with nodes representing entities of interest and edges representing interactions among the entities at different points in time. A common representation for such models is the snapshot model - where a network is defined at logical time-stamps. An important problem under this model is change point detection. In this work we devise an effective and efficient three-step-approach for detecting change points in dynamic networks under the snapshot model. Our algorithm achieves up to 9X speedup over the state-of-the-art while improving quality on both synthetic and real world networks.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/417	Yu Wang, Aniket Chakrabarti, David Sivakoff, Srinivasan Parthasarathy
Cascade Dynamics Modeling with Attention-based Recurrent Neural Network	An ability of modeling and predicting the cascades of resharing is crucial to understanding information propagation and to launching campaign of viral marketing. Conventional methods for cascade prediction heavily depend on the hypothesis of diffusion models, e.g., independent cascade model and linear threshold model. Recently, researchers attempt to circumvent the problem of cascade prediction using sequential models (e.g., recurrent neural network, namely RNN) that do not require knowing the underlying diffusion model. Existing sequential models employ a chain structure to capture the memory effect. However, for cascade prediction, each cascade generally corresponds to a diffusion tree, causing cross-dependence in cascade---one sharing behavior could be triggered by its non-immediate predecessor in the memory chain. In this paper, we propose to an attention-based RNN to capture the cross-dependence in cascade. Furthermore, we introduce a \emph{coverage} strategy to combat the misallocation of attention caused by the memoryless of traditional attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate the proposed models outperform state-of-the-art models at both cascade prediction and inferring diffusion tree.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/416	Yongqing Wang, Huawei Shen, Shenghua Liu, Jinhua Gao, Xueqi Cheng
App Download Forecasting: An Evolutionary Hierarchical Competition Approach	Product sales forecasting enables comprehensive understanding of products' future development, making it of particular interest for companies to improve their business, for investors to measure the values of firms, and for users to capture the trends of a market. Recent studies show that the complex competition interactions among products directly influence products' future development. However, most existing approaches fail to model the evolutionary competition among products and lack the capability to organically reflect multi-level competition analysis in sales forecasting. To address these problems, we propose the Evolutionary Hierarchical Competition Model (EHCM), which effectively considers the time-evolving multi-level competition among products. The EHCM model systematically integrates hierarchical competition analysis with multi-scale time series forecasting. Extensive experiments using a real-world app download dataset show that EHCM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various forecasting granularities.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/415	Yingzi Wang, Nicholas Jing Yuan, Yu Sun, Chuan Qin, Xing Xie
Multiple Medoids based Multi-view Relational Fuzzy Clustering with Minimax Optimization	Multi-view data becomes prevalent nowadays because more and more data can be collected from various sources. Each data set may be described by different set of features, hence forms a multi-view data set or multi-view data in short. To find the underlying pattern embedded in an unlabelled multi-view data, many multi-view clustering approaches have been proposed. Fuzzy clustering in which a data object can belong to several clusters with different memberships is widely used in many applications. However, in most of the fuzzy clustering approaches, a single center or medoid is considered as the representative of each cluster in the end of clustering process. This may not be sufficient to ensure accurate data analysis. In this paper, a new multi-view fuzzy clustering approach based on multiple medoids and minimax optimization called M4-FC for relational data is proposed. In M4-FC, every object is considered as a medoid candidate with a weight. The higher the weight is, the more likely the object is chosen as the final medoid. In the end of clustering process, there may be more than one mediod in each cluster. Moreover, minimax optimization is applied to find consensus clustering results of different views with its set of features. Extensive experimental studies on several multi-view data sets including real world image and document data sets demonstrate that M4-FC not only outperforms single medoid based multi-view fuzzy clustering approach, but also performs better than existing multi-view relational clustering approaches.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/414	Yangtao Wang, Lihui Chen, Xiao-Li Li
Obtaining High-Quality Label by Distinguishing between Easy and Hard Items in Crowdsourcing	Crowdsourcing systems make it possible to hire voluntary workers to label large-scale data by offering them small monetary payments. Usually, the taskmaster requires to collect high-quality labels, while the quality of labels obtained from the crowd may not satisfy this requirement. In this paper, we study the problem of obtaining high-quality labels from the crowd and present an approach of learning the difficulty of items in crowdsourcing, in which we construct a small training set of items with estimated difficulty and then learn a model to predict the difficulty of future items. With the predicted difficulty, we can distinguish between easy and hard items to obtain high-quality labels. For easy items, the quality of their labels inferred from the crowd could be high enough to satisfy the requirement; while for hard items, the crowd could not provide high-quality labels, it is better to choose a more knowledgable crowd or employ specialized workers to label them. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach by learning to distinguish between easy and hard items can significantly improve the label quality.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/413	Wei Wang, Xiang-Yu Guo, Shao-Yuan Li, Yuan Jiang, Zhi-Hua Zhou
Interactive Image Segmentation via Pairwise Likelihood Learning	This paper presents an interactive image segmentation approach where the segmentation problem is formulated as a probabilistic estimation manner. Instead of measuring the distances between unseeded pixels and seeded pixels, we measure the similarities between pixel pairs and seed pairs to improve the robustness to the seeds. The unary prior probability of each pixel belonging to the foreground F and background B can be effectively estimated based on the similarities with label pairs (F, F),(F, B),(B, F) and (B, B). Then a likelihood learning framework is proposed to fuse the region and boundary information of the image by imposing the smoothing constraint on the unary potentials. Experiments on challenging data sets demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain better performance than state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/412	Tao Wang, Quansen Sun, Qi Ge, Zexuan Ji, Qiang Chen, Guiyu Xia
A Sequence Labeling Convolutional Network and Its Application to Handwritten String Recognition	Handwritten string recognition has been struggling with connected patterns fiercely. Segmentation-free and over-segmentation frameworks are commonly applied to deal with this issue. For the past years, RNN combining with CTC has occupied the domain of segmentation-free handwritten string recognition, while CNN is just employed as a single character recognizer in the over-segmentation framework. The main challenges for CNN to directly recognize handwritten strings are the appropriate processing of arbitrary input string length, which implies arbitrary input image size, and reasonable design of the output layer. In this paper, we propose a sequence labeling convolutional network for the recognition of handwritten strings, in particular, the connected patterns. We properly design the structure of the network to predict how many characters present in the input images and what exactly they are at every position. Spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) is utilized with a new implementation to handle arbitrary string length. Moreover, we propose a more flexible pooling strategy called FSPP to adapt the network to the straightforward recognition of long strings better. Experiments conducted on handwritten digital strings from two benchmark datasets and our own cell-phone number dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed network.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/411	Qingqing Wang, Yue Lu
Instance-Level Label Propagation with Multi-Instance Learning	Label propagation is a popular semi-supervised learning technique that transfers information from labeled examples to unlabeled examples through a graph. Most label propagation methods construct a graph based on example-to-example similarity, assuming that the resulting graph connects examples that share similar labels. Unfortunately, example-level similarity is sometimes badly defined. For instance, two images may contain two different objects, but have similar overall appearance due to large similar background. In this case, computing similarities based on whole-image would fail propagating information to the right labels. This paper proposes a novel Instance-Level Label Propagation (ILLP) approach that integrates label propagation with multi-instance learning. Each example is treated as containing multiple instances, as in the case of an image consisting of multiple regions. We first construct a graph based on instance-level similarity and then simultaneously identify the instances carrying the labels and propagate the labels across instances in the graph. Optimization is based on an iterative Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over several state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/410	Qifan Wang, Gal Chechik, Chen Sun, Bin Shen
Angle Principal Component Analysis	Recently, many ℓ1-norm based PCA methods have been developed for dimensionality reduction, but they do not explicitly consider the reconstruction error. Moreover, they do not take into account the relationship between reconstruction error and variance of projected data. This reduces the robustness of algorithms. To handle this problem, a novel formulation for PCA, namely angle PCA, is proposed. Angle PCA employs ℓ2-norm to measure reconstruction error and variance of projected da-ta and maximizes the summation of ratio between variance and reconstruction error of each data. Angle PCA not only is robust to outliers but also retains PCA's desirable property such as rotational invariance. To solve Angle PCA, we propose an iterative algorithm, which has closed-form solution in each iteration. Extensive experiments on several face image databases illustrate that our method is overall superior to the other robust PCA algorithms, such as PCA, PCA-L1 greedy, PCA-L1 nongreedy and HQ-PCA.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/409	Qianqian Wang, Quanxue Gao, Xinbo Gao, Feiping Nie
Convolutional 2D LDA for Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction	Representing high-volume and high-order data is an essential problem, especially in machine learning field. Although existing two-dimensional (2D) discriminant analysis achieves promising performance, the single and linear projection features make it difficult to analyze more complex data. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional two-dimensional linear discriminant analysis (2D LDA) method for data representation. In order to deal with nonlinear data, a specially designed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is presented, which can be proved having the equivalent objective function with common 2D LDA. In this way, the discriminant ability can benefit from not only the nonlinearity of Convolutional Neural Networks, but also the powerful learning process. Experiment results on several datasets show that the proposed method performs better than other state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/408	Qi Wang, Zequn Qin, Feiping Nie, Yuan Yuan
Multi-Component Nonnegative Matrix Factorization	Real data are usually complex and contain various components. For example, face images have expressions and genders. Each component mainly reflects one aspect of data and provides information others do not have. Therefore, exploring the semantic information of multiple components as well as the diversity among them is of great benefit to understand data comprehensively and in-depth. However, this cannot be achieved by current nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)-based methods, despite that NMF has shown remarkable competitiveness in learning parts-based representation of data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-component nonnegative matrix factorization (MCNMF). Instead of seeking for only one representation of data, MCNMF learns multiple representations simultaneously, with the help of the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) as a diversity term. HSIC explores the diverse information among the representations, where each representation corresponds to a component. By integrating the multiple representations, a more comprehensive representation is then established. A new iterative updating optimization scheme is derived to solve the objective function of MCNMF, along with its correctness and convergence guarantees. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets have shown that MCNMF not only achieves more accurate performance over the state-of-the-arts using the aggregated representation, but also interprets data from different aspects with the multiple representations, which is beyond what current NMFs can offer.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/407	Jing Wang, Feng Tian, Xiao Wang, Hongchuan Yu, Chang Hong Liu, Liang Yang
Combining Knowledge with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Short Text Classification	Text classification is a fundamental task in NLP applications. Most existing work relied on either explicit or implicit text representation to address this problem. While these techniques work well for sentences, they can not easily be applied to short text because of its shortness and sparsity. In this paper, we propose a framework based on convolutional neural networks that combines explicit and implicit representations of short text for classification. We first conceptualize a short text as a set of relevant concepts using a large taxonomy knowledge base. We then obtain the embedding of short text by coalescing the words and relevant concepts on top of pre-trained word vectors. We further incorporate character level features into our model to capture fine-grained subword information. Experimental results on five commonly used datasets show that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/406	Jin Wang, Zhongyuan Wang, Dawei Zhang, Jun Yan
Active Learning for Black-Box Semantic Role Labeling with Neural Factors	Active learning is a useful technique for tasks for which unlabeled data is abundant but manual labeling is expensive. One example of such a task is semantic role labeling (SRL), which relies heavily on labels from trained linguistic experts. One challenge in applying active learning algorithms for SRL is that the complete knowledge of the SRL model is often unavailable, against the common assumption that active learning methods are aware of the details of the underlying models. In this paper, we present an active learning framework for black-box SRL models (i.e., models whose details are unknown). In lieu of a query strategy based on model details, we propose a neural query strategy model that embeds both language and semantic information to automatically learn the query strategy from predictions of an SRL model alone. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both this new active learning framework and the neural query strategy model.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/405	Chenguang Wang, Laura Chiticariu, Yunyao Li
Tag Disentangled Generative Adversarial Network for Object Image Re-rendering	In this paper, we propose a principled Tag Disentangled Generative Adversarial Networks (TD-GAN) for re-rendering new images for the object of interest from a single image of it by specifying multiple scene properties (such as viewpoint, illumination, expression, etc.). The whole framework consists of a disentangling network, a generative network, a tag mapping net, and a discriminative network, which are trained jointly based on a given set of images that are completely/partially tagged (i.e., supervised/semi-supervised setting). Given an input image, the disentangling network extracts disentangled and interpretable representations, which are then used to generate images by the generative network. In order to boost the quality of disentangled representations, the tag mapping net is integrated to explore the consistency between the image and its tags. Furthermore, the discriminative network is introduced to implement the adversarial training strategy for generating more realistic images. Experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed framework in the problem of interest.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/404	Chaoyue Wang, Chaohui Wang, Chang Xu, Dacheng Tao
Locality Preserving Projections for Grassmann manifold	Learning on Grassmann manifold has become popular in many computer vision tasks, with the strong capability to extract discriminative information for imagesets and videos. However, such learning algorithms particularly on high-dimensional Grassmann manifold always involve with significantly high computational cost, which seriously limits the applicability of learning on Grassmann manifold in more wide areas. In this research, we propose an unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm on Grassmann manifold based on the Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) criterion. LPP is a commonly used dimensionality reduction algorithm for vector-valued data, aiming to preserve local structure of data in the dimension-reduced space. The strategy is to construct a mapping from higher dimensional Grassmann manifold into the one in a relative low-dimensional with more discriminative capability. The proposed method can be optimized as a basic eigenvalue problem. The performance of our proposed method is assessed on several classification and clustering tasks and the experimental results show show its clear advantages over other Grassmann based algorithms.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/403	Boyue Wang, Yongli Hu, Junbin Gao, Yanfeng Sun, Haoran Chen, Muhammad Ali, Baocai Yin
Sifting Common Information from Many Variables	Measuring the relationship between any pair of variables is a rich and active area of research that is central to scientific practice. In contrast, characterizing the common information among any group of variables is typically a theoretical exercise with few practical methods for high-dimensional data. A promising solution would be a multivariate generalization of the famous Wyner common information, but this approach relies on solving an apparently intractable optimization problem. We leverage the recently introduced information sieve decomposition to formulate an incremental version of the common information problem that admits a simple fixed point solution, fast convergence, and complexity that is linear in the number of variables. This scalable approach allows us to demonstrate the usefulness of common information in high-dimensional learning problems.The sieve outperforms standard methods on dimensionality reduction tasks, solves a blind source separation problem that cannot be solved with ICA, and accurately recovers structure in brain imaging data.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/402	Greg Ver Steeg, Shuyang Gao, Kyle Reing, Aram Galstyan
Scaling Active Search using Linear Similarity Functions	Active Search has become an increasingly useful tool in information retrieval problems where the goal is to discover as many target elements as possible using only limited label queries. With the advent of big data, there is a growing emphasis on the scalability of such techniques to handle very large and very complex datasets. In this paper, we consider the problem of Active Search where we are given a similarity function between data points. We look at an algorithm introduced by Wang et al. [Wang et al., 2013] known as Active Search on Graphs and propose crucial modifications which allow it to scale significantly. Their approach selects points by minimizing an energy function over the graph induced by the similarity function on the data. Our modifications require the similarity function to be a dot-product between feature vectors of data points, equivalent to having a linear kernel for the adjacency matrix. With this, we are able to scale tremendously: for n data points, the original algorithm runs in O(n^2) time per iteration while ours runs in only O(nr + r^2) given r-dimensional features. We also describe a simple alternate approach using a weighted-neighbor predictor which also scales well. In our experiments, we show that our method is competitive with existing semi-supervised approaches. We also briefly discuss conditions under which our algorithm performs well.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/401	Sibi Venkatesan, James K. Miller, Jeff Schneider, Artur Dubrawski
COBRA: A Fast and Simple Method for Active Clustering with Pairwise Constraints	Clustering is inherently ill-posed: there often exist multiple valid clusterings of a single dataset, and without any additional information a clustering system has no way of knowing which clustering it should produce. This motivates the use of constraints in clustering, as they allow users to communicate their interests to the clustering system. Active constraint-based clustering algorithms select the most useful constraints to query, aiming to produce a good clustering using as few constraints as possible. We propose COBRA, an active method that first over-clusters the data by running K-means with a $K$ that is intended to be too large, and subsequently merges the resulting small clusters into larger ones based on pairwise constraints. In its merging step, COBRA is able to keep the number of pairwise queries low by maximally exploiting constraint transitivity and entailment. We experimentally show that COBRA outperforms the state of the art in terms of clustering quality and runtime, without requiring the number of clusters in advance.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/400	Toon Van Craenendonck, Sebastijan Dumancic, Hendrik Blockeel
TransNet: Translation-Based Network Representation Learning for Social Relation Extraction	Conventional network representation learning (NRL) models learn low-dimensional vertex representations by simply regarding each edge as a binary or continuous value. However, there exists rich semantic information on edges and the interactions between vertices usually preserve distinct meanings, which are largely neglected by most existing NRL models. In this work, we present a novel Translation-based NRL model, TransNet, by regarding the interactions between vertices as a translation operation. Moreover, we formalize the task of Social Relation Extraction (SRE) to evaluate the capability of NRL methods on modeling the relations between vertices. Experimental results on SRE demonstrate that TransNet significantly outperforms other baseline methods by 10% to 20% on hits@1. The source code and datasets can be obtained from https://github.com/thunlp/TransNet.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/399	Cunchao Tu, Zhengyan Zhang, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun
Disambiguating Energy Disaggregation: A Collective Probabilistic Approach	Reducing household energy usage is a priority for improving the resiliency and stability of the power grid and decreasing the negative impact of energy consumption on the environment and public health.Relevant and timely feedback about the power consumption of specific appliances can help household residents to reduce their energy demand. Given only a total energy reading, such as that collected from a residential meter, energy disaggregation strives to discover the consumption of individual appliances. Existing disaggregation algorithms are computationally inefficient and rely heavily on high-resolution ground truth data. We introduce a probabilistic framework which infers the energy consumption of individual appliances using a hinge-loss Markov random field (HL-MRF), which admits highly scalable inference. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce a temporal representation which leverages state duration. We also explore how contextual information impacts solution quality with low-resolution data. Our framework is flexible in its ability to incorporate additional constraints; by constraining appliance usage with context and duration we can better disambiguate appliances with similar energy consumption profiles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on two public real-world datasets, reducing the error relative to a previous state-of-the-art method by as much as 50%.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/398	Sabina Tomkins, Jay Pujara, Lise Getoor
Retaining Data from Streams of Social Platforms with Minimal Regret	Today's social platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, continuously generate massive volumes of data. The resulting data streams exceed any reasonable limit for permanent storage, especially since data is often redundant, overlapping, sparse, and generally of low value. This calls for means to retain solely a small fraction of the data in an online manner. In this paper, we propose techniques to effectively decide which data to retain, such that the induced loss of information, the regret of neglecting certain data, is minimized. These techniques enable not only efficient processing of massive streaming data, but are also adaptive and address the dynamic nature of social media. Experiments on large-scale real-world datasets illustrate the feasibility of our approach in terms of both, runtime and information quality.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/397	Nguyen Thanh Tam, Matthias Weidlich, Duong Chi Thang, Hongzhi Yin, Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung
From Ensemble Clustering to Multi-View Clustering	Multi-View Clustering (MVC) aims to find the cluster structure shared by multiple views of a particular dataset. Existing MVC methods mainly integrate the raw data from different views, while ignoring the high-level information. Thus, their performance may degrade due to the conflict between heterogeneous features and the noises existing in each individual view. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel Multi-View Ensemble Clustering (MVEC) framework to solve MVC in an Ensemble Clustering (EC) way, which generates Basic Partitions (BPs) for each view individually and seeks for a consensus partition among all the BPs. By this means, we naturally leverage the complementary information of multi-view data in the same partition space. Instead of directly fusing BPs, we employ the low-rank and sparse decomposition to explicitly consider the connection between different views and detect the noises in each view. Moreover, the spectral ensemble clustering task is also involved by our framework with a carefully designed constraint, making MVEC a unified optimization framework to achieve the final consensus partition. Experimental results on six real-world datasets show the efficacy of our approach compared with both MVC and EC methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/396	Zhiqiang Tao, Hongfu Liu, Sheng Li, Zhengming  Ding, Yun Fu
Inverse Covariance Estimation with Structured Groups	Estimating the inverse covariance matrix of p variables from n observations is challenging when n is much less than p, since the sample covariance matrix is singular and cannot be inverted. A popular solution is to optimize for the L1 penalized estimator; however, this does not incorporate structure domain knowledge and can be expensive to optimize. We consider finding inverse covariance matrices with group structure, defined as potentially overlapping principal submatrices, determined from domain knowledge (e.g. categories or graph cliques). We propose a new estimator for this problem setting that can be derived efficiently via the conditional gradient method, leveraging chordal decomposition theory for scalability. Simulation results show significant improvement in sample complexity when the correct group structure is known. We also apply these estimators to 14,910 stock closing prices, with noticeable improvement when group sparsity is exploited.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/395	Shaozhe Tao, Yifan Sun, Daniel Boley
Robust Survey Aggregation with Student-t Distribution and Sparse Representation	Most existing survey aggregation methods assume that the sample data follow Gaussian distribution. However, these methods are sensitive to outliers, due to the thin-tailed property of the Gaussian distribution. To address this issue, we propose a robust survey aggregation method based on Student-t distribution and sparse representation. Specifically, we assume that the samples follow Student-$t$ distribution, instead of the common Gaussian distribution. Due to the Student-t distribution, our method is robust to outliers, which can be explained from both Bayesian point of view and non-Bayesian point of view. In addition, inspired by James-Stain estimator (JS) and Compressive Averaging (CAvg), we propose to sparsely represent the global mean vector by an adaptive basis comprising both data-specific basis and combined generic bases. Theoretically, we prove that JS and CAvg are special cases of our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real datasets.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/394	Qingtao Tang, Tao Dai, Li Niu, Yisen Wang, Shu-Tao Xia, Jianfei Cai
Student-t Process Regression with Student-t Likelihood	Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is a powerful Bayesian method. However, the performance of GPR can be significantly degraded when the training data are contaminated by outliers, including target outliers and input outliers. Although there are some variants of GPR (e.g., GPR with Student-t likelihood (GPRT)) aiming to handle outliers, most of the variants focus on handling the target outliers while little effort has been done to deal with the input outliers. In contrast, in this work, we aim to handle both the target outliers and the input outliers at the same time. Specifically, we replace the Gaussian noise in GPR with independent Student-t noise to cope with the target outliers. Moreover, to enhance the robustness w.r.t. the input outliers, we use a Student-t Process prior instead of the common Gaussian Process prior, leading to Student-t Process Regression with Student-t Likelihood (TPRT). We theoretically show that TPRT is more robust to both input and target outliers than GPR and GPRT, and prove that both GPR and GPRT are special cases of TPRT. Various experiments demonstrate that TPRT outperforms GPR and its variants on both synthetic and real datasets.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/393	Qingtao Tang, Li Niu, Yisen Wang, Tao Dai, Wangpeng An, Jianfei Cai, Shu-Tao Xia
Bayesian Dynamic Mode Decomposition	Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a data-driven method for calculating a modal representation of a nonlinear dynamical system, and it has been utilized in various fields of science and engineering. In this paper, we propose Bayesian DMD, which provides a principled way to transfer the advantages of the Bayesian formulation into DMD. To this end, we first develop a probabilistic model corresponding to DMD, and then, provide the Gibbs sampler for the posterior inference in Bayesian DMD. Moreover, as a specific example, we discuss the case of using a sparsity-promoting prior for an automatic determination of the number of dynamic modes. We investigate the empirical performance of Bayesian DMD using synthetic and real-world datasets.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/392	Naoya Takeishi, Yoshinobu Kawahara, Yasuo Tabei, Takehisa Yairi
MRLR: Multi-level Representation Learning for Personalized Ranking in Recommendation	Representation learning (RL) has recently proven to be effective in capturing local item relationships by modeling item co-occurrence in individual user's interaction record. However, the value of RL for recommendation has not reached the full potential due to two major drawbacks: 1) recommendation is modeled as a rating prediction problem but should essentially be a personalized ranking one; 2) multi-level organizations of items are neglected for fine-grained item relationships. We design a unified Bayesian framework MRLR to learn user and item embeddings from a multi-level item organization, thus benefiting from RL as well as achieving the goal of personalized ranking. Extensive validation on real-world datasets shows that MRLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/391	Zhu Sun, Jie  Yang, Jie Zhang, Alessandro Bozzon, Yu Chen, Chi Xu
CHARDA: Causal Hybrid Automata Recovery via Dynamic Analysis	We propose and evaluate a new technique for learning hybrid automata automatically by observing the runtime behavior of a dynamical system.Working from a sequence of continuous state values and predicates about the environment, CHARDA recovers the distinct dynamic modes, learns a model for each mode from a given set of templates, and postulates \textit{causal} guard conditions which trigger transitions between modes.Our main contribution is the use of information-theoretic measures (1)~as a cost function for data segmentation and model selction to penalize over-fitting and (2)~to determine the likely causes of each transition.CHARDA is easily extended with different classes of model templates, fitting methods, or predicates.In our experiments on a complex videogame character, CHARDA successfully discovers a reasonable over-approximation of the character's true behaviors.Our results also compare favorably against recent work in automatically learning probabilistic timed automata in an aircraft domain: CHARDA exactly learns the modes of these simpler automata.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/390	Adam Summerville, Joseph Osborn, Michael Mateas
Correlational Dueling Bandits with Application to Clinical Treatment in Large Decision Spaces	We consider sequential decision making under uncertainty, the optimization over large decision space with noisy comparative feedback. This problem can be formulated as a K-armed Dueling Bandits problem where K is the total number of decisions. When K is very large, existing dueling bandits algorithms suffer huge cumulative regret before converging on the optimal arm. This paper studies the dueling bandits problem with a large number of dependent arms. Our problem is motivated by a clinical decision making process in large decision space. We propose an efficient algorithm CorrDuel for the problem which makes decisions to simultaneously deliver effective therapy and explore the decision space. Many sequential decision making problems with large and structured decision space could be facilitated by our algorithm. After evaluated the fast convergence of CorrDuel in analysis and simulation experiments, we applied it on a live clinical trial of therapeutic spinal cord stimulation. It is the first applied algorithm towards spinal cord injury treatments and experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/389	Yanan Sui, Joel W.

Deep Supervised Hashing with Nonlinear Projections	Hashing has attracted broad research interests in large scale image retrieval due to its high search speed and efficient storage. Recently, many deep hashing methods have been proposed to perform simultaneous nonlinear feature learning and hash projection learning, which have shown superior performance compared to hand-crafted feature based hashing methods. Nonlinear projection functions have shown their advantages over the linear ones due to their powerful generalization capabilities. To improve the performance of deep hashing methods by generalizing projection functions, we propose the idea of implementing a pure nonlinear deep hashing network architecture. By consolidating the above idea, this paper presents a Deep Supervised Hashing architecture with Nonlinear Projections (DSHNP). In particular, soft decision trees are adopted as the nonlinear projection functions, since they can generate differentiable nonlinear outputs and can be trained with deep neural networks in an end-to-end way. Moreover, to make the hash codes as independent as possible, we design two regularizers imposed on the parameter matrices of the leaves in the soft decision trees. Extensive evaluations on two benchmark image datasets show that the proposed DSHNP outperforms several state-of-the-art hashing methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/388	Sen Su, Gang Chen, Xiang Cheng, Rong Bi
Vertex-Weighted Hypergraph Learning for Multi-View Object Classification	3D object classification with multi-view representation has become very popular, thanks to the progress on computer techniques and graphic hardware, and attracted much research attention in recent years. Regarding this task, there are mainly two challenging issues, i.e., the complex correlation among multiple views and the possible imbalance data issue. In this work, we propose to employ the hypergraph structure to formulate the relationship among 3D objects, taking the advantage of hypergraph on high-order correlation modelling. However, traditional hypergraph learning method may suffer from the imbalance data issue. To this end, we propose a vertex-weighted hypergraph learning algorithm for multi-view 3D object classification, introducing an updated hypergraph structure. In our method, the correlation among different objects is formulated in a hypergraph structure and each object (vertex) is associated with a corresponding weight, weighting the importance of each sample in the learning process. The learning process is conducted on the vertex-weighted hypergraph and the estimated object relevance is employed for object classification. The proposed method has been evaluated on two public benchmarks, i.e., the NTU and the PSB datasets. Experimental results and comparison with the state-of-the-art methods and recent deep learning method demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/387	Lifan Su, Yue Gao, Xibin Zhao, Hai Wan, Ming Gu, Jiaguang Sun
Forecast the Plausible Paths in Crowd Scenes	Forecasting the future plausible paths of pedestrians in crowd scenes is of wide applications, but it still remains as a challenging task due to the complexities and uncertainties of crowd motions. To address these issues, we propose to explore the inherent crowd dynamics via a social-aware recurrent Gaussian process model, which facilitates the path prediction by taking advantages of the interplay between the rich prior knowledge and motion uncertainties. Specifically, we derive a social-aware LSTM to explore the crowd dynamic, resulting in a hidden feature embedding the rich prior in massive data. Afterwards, we integrate the descriptor into deep Gaussian processes with motion uncertainties appropriately harnessed. Crowd motion forecasting is implemented by regressing relative motion against the current positions, yielding the predicted paths based on a functional object associated with a distribution. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method obtains the state-of-the-art performance in both structured and unstructured scenes by exploring the complex and uncertain motion patterns, even if the occlusion is serious or the observed trajectories are noisy.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/386	Hang Su, Jun Zhu, Yinpeng Dong, Bo Zhang
End-to-end optimization of goal-driven and visually grounded dialogue systems	End-to-end design of dialogue systems has recently become a popular research topic thanks to powerful tools such as encoder-decoder architectures for sequence-to-sequence learning. Yet, most current approaches cast human-machine dialogue management as a supervised learning problem, aiming at predicting the next utterance of a participant given the full history of the dialogue. This vision may fail to correctly render the planning problem inherent to dialogue as well as its contextual and grounded nature. In this paper, we introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning method to optimize visually grounded task-oriented dialogues, based on the policy gradient algorithm. This approach is tested on the question generation task from the dataset GuessWhat?! containing 120k dialogues and provides encouraging results at solving both the problem of generating natural dialogues and the task of discovering a specific object in a complex picture.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/385	Florian Strub, Harm de Vries, Jérémie Mary, Bilal Piot, Aaron Courville, Olivier Pietquin
Fast Sparse Gaussian Markov Random Fields Learning Based on Cholesky Factorization	Learning the sparse Gaussian Markov Random Field, or conversely, estimating the sparse inverse covariance matrix is an approach to uncover the underlying dependency structure in data. Most of the current methods solve the problem by optimizing the maximum likelihood objective with a Laplace prior L1 on entries of a precision matrix. We propose a novel objective with a regularization term which penalizes an approximate product of the Cholesky decomposed precision matrix. This new reparametrization of the penalty term allows efficient coordinate descent optimization, which in synergy with an active set approach results in a very fast and efficient method for learning the sparse inverse covariance matrix. We evaluated the speed and solution quality of the newly proposed SCHL method on problems consisting of up to 24,840 variables. Our approach was several times faster than three state-of-the-art approaches. We also demonstrate that SCHL can be used to discover interpretable networks, by applying it to a high impact problem from the health informatics domain.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/384	Ivan Stojkovic, Vladisav Jelisavcic, Veljko Milutinovic, Zoran Obradovic
Two dimensional Large Margin Nearest Neighbor for Matrix Classification	Matrices are common forms of data that are encountered in a wide range of real applications. How to classify this kind of data is an important research topic. In this paper, we propose a novel distance metric learning method named two dimensional large margin nearest neighbor (2DLMNNN), for improving the performance of k nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier in matrix classification. In the proposed method, left and right projection matrices are employed to define the matrix-based Mahalanobis distance, which is used to construct the objective aimed at separating points in different classes by a large margin. The parameters in those two projection matrices are much less than that in its vector-based counterpart, thus our method reduces the risks of overfitting. We also introduce a framework for solving the proposed 2DLMNN. The convergence behavior, initialization, and parameter determination are also analyzed. Compared with vector-based methods, 2DLMNN performs better for matrix data classification. Promising experimental results on several data sets are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/383	Kun Song, Feiping Nie, Junwei Han
Recommendation vs Sentiment Analysis: A Text-Driven Latent Factor Model for Rating Prediction with Cold-Start Awareness	Review rating prediction is an important research topic. The problem was approached from either the perspective of recommender systems (RS) or that of sentiment analysis (SA). Recent SA research using deep neural networks (DNNs) has realized the importance of user and product interaction for better interpreting the sentiment of reviews. However, the complexity of DNN models in terms of the scale of parameters is very high, and the performance is not always satisfying especially when user-product interaction is sparse. In this paper, we propose a simple, extensible RS-based model, called Text-driven Latent Factor Model (TLFM), to capture the semantics of reviews, user preferences and product characteristics by jointly optimizing two components, a user-specific LFM and a product-specific LFM, each of which decomposes text into a specific low-dimension representation. Furthermore, we address the cold-start issue by developing a novel Pairwise Rating Comparison strategy (PRC), which utilizes the difference between ratings on common user/product as supplementary information to calibrate parameter estimation. Experiments conducted on IMDB and Yelp datasets validate the advantage of our approach over state-of-the-art baseline methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/382	Kaisong Song, Wei Gao, Shi Feng, Daling Wang, Kam-Fai Wong, Chengqi Zhang
Hierarchical LSTM with Adjusted Temporal Attention for Video Captioning	"Recent progress has been made in using attention based encoder-decoder framework for video captioning. However, most existing decoders apply the attention mechanism to every generated words including both visual words (e.g., ""gun"" and ""shooting"") and non-visual words (e.g. ""the"", ""a"").However, these non-visual words can be easily predicted using natural language model without considering visual signals or attention.Imposing attention mechanism on non-visual words could mislead and decrease the overall performance of video captioning.To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical LSTM with adjusted temporal attention (hLSTMat) approach for video captioning. Specifically, the proposed framework utilizes the temporal attention for selecting specific frames to predict related words, while the adjusted temporal attention is for deciding whether to depend on the visual information or the language context information. Also, a hierarchical LSTMs is designed to simultaneously consider both low-level visual information and deep semantic information to support the video caption generation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we test our method on two prevalent datasets: MSVD and MSR-VTT, and experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both two datasets."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/381	Jingkuan Song, Lianli Gao, Zhao Guo, Wu Liu, Dongxiang Zhang, Heng Tao Shen
Learning Hedonic Games	Coalitional stability in hedonic games has usually been considered in the setting where agent preferences are fully known. We consider the setting where agent preferences are unknown; we lay the theoretical foundations for studying the interplay between coalitional stability and (PAC) learning in hedonic games. We introduce the notion of PAC stability - the equivalent of core stability under uncertainty - and examine the PAC stabilizability and learnability of several popular classes of hedonic games.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/380	Jakub Sliwinski, Yair Zick
Learning with Previously Unseen Features	We study the problem of improving a machine learning model by identifying and using features that are not in the training set. This is applicable to machine learning systems deployed in an open environment. For example, a prediction model built on a set of sensors may be improved when it has access to new and relevant sensors at test time. To effectively use new features, we propose a novel approach that learns a model over both the original and new features, with the goal of making the joint distribution of features and predicted labels similar to that in the training set. Our approach can naturally leverage labels associated with these new features when they are accessible. We present an efficient optimization algorithm for learning the model parameters and empirically evaluate the approach on several regression and classification tasks. Experimental results show that our approach can achieve on average 11.2% improvement over baselines.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/379	Yuan Shi, Craig A. Knoblock
Accelerated Doubly Stochastic Gradient Algorithm for Large-scale Empirical Risk Minimization	Nowadays, algorithms with fast convergence, small memory footprints, and low per-iteration complexity are particularly favorable for artificial intelligence applications. In this paper, we propose a doubly stochastic algorithm with a novel accelerating multi-momentum technique to solve large scale empirical risk minimization problem for learning tasks. While enjoying a provably superior convergence rate, in each iteration, such algorithm only accesses a mini batch of samples and meanwhile updates a small block of variable coordinates, which substantially reduces the amount of memory reference when both the massive sample size and ultra-high dimensionality are involved. Specifically, to obtain an ε-accurate solution, our algorithm requires only O(log(1/ε)/sqrt(ε)) overall computation for the general convex case and O((n+sqrt{nκ})log(1/ε)) for the strongly convex case. Empirical studies on huge scale datasets are conducted to illustrate the efficiency of our method in practice.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/378	Zebang Shen, Hui Qian, Tongzhou Mu, Chao Zhang
Learning Multi-level Region Consistency with Dense Multi-label Networks for Semantic Segmentation	Semantic image segmentation is a fundamental task in image understanding. Per-pixel semantic labelling of an image benefits greatly from the ability to consider region consistency both locally and globally. However, many Fully Convolutional Network based methods do not impose such consistency, which may give rise to noisy and implausible predictions. We address this issue by proposing a dense multi-label network module that is able to encourage the region consistency at different levels. This simple but effective module can be easily integrated into any semantic segmentation systems. With comprehensive experiments, we show that the dense multi-label can successfully remove the implausible labels and clear the confusion so as to boost the performance of semantic segmentation systems.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/377	Tong Shen, Guosheng Lin, Chunhua Shen, Ian Reid
Compressed Nonparametric Language Modelling	Hierarchical Pitman-Yor Process priors are compelling for learning language models, outperforming point-estimate based methods. However, these models remain unpopular due to computational and statistical inference issues, such as memory and time usage, as well as poor mixing of sampler. In this work we propose a novel framework which represents the HPYP model compactly using compressed suffix trees. Then, we develop an efficient approximate inference scheme in this framework that has a much lower memory footprint compared to full HPYP and is fast in the inference time. The experimental results illustrate that our model can be built on significantly larger datasets compared to previous HPYP models, while being several orders of magnitudes smaller, fast for training and inference, and outperforming the perplexity of the state-of-the-art Modified Kneser-Ney count-based LM smoothing by up to 15%.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/376	Ehsan Shareghi, Gholamreza  Haffari, Trevor Cohn
Locally Consistent Bayesian Network Scores for Multi-Relational Data	An important task for relational learning is Bayesian network (BN) structure learning. A fundamental component of structure learning is a model selection score that measures how well a model fits a dataset. We describe a new method that upgrades for multi-relational databases, a log-linear BN score designed for single-table i.i.d. data. Chickering and Meek showed that for i.i.d. data, standard BN scores are locally consistent, meaning that their maxima converge to an optimal model, that represents the data generating distribution {\em and} contains no redundant edges. Our main theorem establishes that if a model selection score is locally consistent for i.i.d. data, then our upgraded gain function is locally consistent for relational data as well. To our knowledge this is the first consistency result for relational structure learning. A novel aspect of our approach is employing a {\em gain function} that compares two models: a current vs. an alternative BN structure. In contrast, previous approaches employed a score that is a function of a single model only. Empirical evaluation on six benchmark relational databases shows that our gain function is also practically useful: On realistic size data sets, it selects informative BN structures with a better data fit than those selected by baseline single-model scores.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/375	Oliver Schulte, Sajjad Gholami
Convolutional-Match Networks for Question Answering	In this paper, we present a simple, yet effective, attention and memory mechanism that is reminiscent of Memory Networks and we demonstrate it in question-answering scenarios. Our mechanism is based on four simple premises: a) memories can be formed from word sequences by using convolutional networks; b) distance measurements can be taken at a neuronal level; c) a recursive softmax function can be used for attention; d) extensive weight sharing can help profoundly. We achieve state-of-the-art results in the bAbI tasks, outperforming both Memory Networks and the Differentiable Neural Computer, both in terms of accuracy and stability (i.e. variance) of results.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/374	Spyridon Samothrakis, Tom Vodopivec, Michael Fairbank, Maria Fasli
LMPP: A Large Margin Point Process Combining Reinforcement and Competition for Modeling Hashtag Popularity	Predicting the popularity dynamics of Twitter hashtags has a broad spectrum of applications. Existing works have mainly focused on modeling the popularity of individual tweets rather than the popularity of the underlying hashtags. Hence, they do not consider several realistic factors for hashtag popularity. In this paper, we propose Large Margin Point Process (LMPP), a probabilistic framework that integrates hashtag-tweet influence and hashtag-hashtag competitions, the two factors which play important roles in hashtag propagation. Furthermore, while considering the hashtag competitions, LMPP looks into the variations of popularity rankings of the competing hashtags across time. Extensive experiments on seven real datasets demonstrate that LMPP outperforms existing popularity prediction approaches by a significant margin. Going further, LMPP can accurately predict the relative rankings of competing hashtags, offering additional advantage over the state-of-the-art baselines.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/373	Bidisha Samanta, Abir De, Abhijnan Chakraborty, Niloy Ganguly
See without looking: joint visualization of sensitive multi-site datasets	Visualization of high dimensional large-scale datasets via an embedding into a 2D map is a powerful exploration tool for assessing latent structure in the data and detecting outliers. There are many methods developed for this task but most assume that all pairs of samples are available for common computation. Specifically, the distances between all pairs of points need to be directly computable. In contrast, we work with sensitive neuroimaging data, when local sites cannot share their samples and the distances cannot be easily computed across the sites. Yet, the desire is to let all the local data participate in collaborative computation without leaving their respective sites. In this scenario, a quality control tool that visualizes decentralized dataset in its entirety via global aggregation of local computations is especially important as it would allow screening of samples that cannot be evaluated otherwise. This paper introduces an algorithm to solve this problem: decentralized data stochastic neighbor embedding (dSNE). Based on the MNIST dataset we introduce metrics for measuring the embedding quality and use them to compare dSNE to its centralized counterpart. We also apply dSNE to a multi-site neuroimaging dataset with encouraging results.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/372	Debbrata K. Saha, Vince D. Calhoun, Sandeep R. Panta, Sergey M. Plis
Right for the Right Reasons: Training Differentiable Models by Constraining their Explanations	Expressive classifiers such as neural networks are among the most accurate supervised learning methods in use today, but their opaque decision boundaries make them difficult to trust in critical applications. We propose a method to explain the predictions of any differentiable model via the gradient of the class label with respect to the input (which provides a normal to the decision boundary). Not only is this approach orders of magnitude faster at identifying input dimensions of high sensitivity than sample-based perturbation methods (e.g. LIME), but it also lends itself to efficiently discovering multiple qualitatively different decision boundaries as well as decision boundaries that are consistent with expert annotation. On multiple datasets, we show our approach generalizes much better when test conditions differ from those in training.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/371	Andrew Slavin Ross, Michael C.

Distributed Accelerated Proximal Coordinate Gradient Methods	We develop a general accelerated proximal coordinate descent algorithm in distributed settings (Dis- APCG) for the optimization problem that minimizes the sum of two convex functions: the first part f is smooth with a gradient oracle, and the other one Ψ is separable with respect to blocks of coordinate and has a simple known structure (e.g., L1 norm). Our algorithm gets new accelerated convergence rate in the case that f is strongly con- vex by making use of modern parallel structures, and includes previous non-strongly case as a special case. We further present efficient implementations to avoid full-dimensional operations in each step, significantly reducing the computation cost. Experiments on the regularized empirical risk minimization problem demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm and match our theoretical findings.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/370	Yong Ren, Jun Zhu
Sense Beauty by Label Distribution Learning	Beauty is always an attractive topic in the human society, not only artists and psychologists, but also scientists have been searching for an answer -- what is beautiful. This paper presents an approach to learning the human sense toward facial beauty. Different from previous study, the human sense is represented by a label distribution, which covers the full range of beauty ratings and indicates the degree to which each beauty rating describes the face. The motivation is that the human sense of beauty is generally quite subjective, thus it might be inappropriate to represent it with a single scalar, as most previous work does. Therefore, we propose a method called Beauty Distribution Transformation(BDT) to covert the k-wise ratings to label distributions and propose a learning method called Structural Label Distribution Learning(SLDL) based on structural Support Vector Machine to learn the human sense of facial beauty.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/369	Yi Ren, Xin Geng
Robust Softmax Regression for Multi-class Classification with Self-Paced Learning	Softmax regression, a generalization of Logistic regression (LR) in the setting of multi-class classification, has been widely used in many machine learning applications. However, the performance of softmax regression is extremely sensitive to the presence of noisy data and outliers. To address this issue, we propose a model of robust softmax regression (RoSR) originated from the self-paced learning (SPL) paradigm for multi-class classification. Concretely, RoSR equipped with the soft weighting scheme is able to evaluate the importance of each data instance. Then, data instances participate in the classification problem according to their weights. In this way, the influence of noisy data and outliers (which are typically with small weights) can be significantly reduced. However, standard SPL may suffer from the imbalanced class influence problem, where some classes may have little influence in the training process if their instances are not sensitive to the loss. To alleviate this problem, we design two novel soft weighting schemes that assign weights and select instances locally for each class. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/368	Yazhou Ren, Peng Zhao, Yongpan Sheng, Dezhong Yao, Zenglin Xu
Stacking With Auxiliary Features	Ensembling methods are well known for improving prediction accuracy. However, they are limited in the sense that they cannot effectively discriminate among component models. In this paper, we propose stacking with auxiliary features that learns to fuse additional relevant information from multiple component systems as well as input instances to improve performance. We use two types of auxiliary features -- instance features and provenance features. The instance features enable the stacker to discriminate across input instances and the provenance features enable the stacker to discriminate across component systems. When combined together, our algorithm learns to rely on systems that not just agree on an output but also the provenance of this output in conjunction with the properties of the input instance. We demonstrate the success of our approach on three very different and challenging natural language and vision problems: Slot Filling, Entity Discovery and Linking, and ImageNet Object Detection. We obtain new state-of-the-art results on the first two tasks and significant improvements on the ImageNet task, thus verifying the power and generality of our approach.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/367	Nazneen Fatema Rajani, Raymond J.

A Dual-Stage Attention-Based Recurrent Neural Network for Time Series Prediction	The Nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) model, which predicts the current value of a time series based upon its previous values as well as the current and past values of multiple driving (exogenous) series, has been studied for decades. Despite the fact that various NARX models have been developed, few of them can capture the long-term temporal dependencies appropriately and select the relevant driving series to make predictions. In this paper, we propose a dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network (DA-RNN) to address these two issues. In the first stage, we introduce an input attention mechanism to adaptively extract relevant driving series (a.k.a., input features) at each time step by referring to the previous encoder hidden state. In the second stage, we use a temporal attention mechanism to select relevant encoder hidden states across all time steps. With this dual-stage attention scheme, our model can not only make predictions effectively, but can also be easily interpreted. Thorough empirical studies based upon the SML 2010 dataset and the NASDAQ 100 Stock dataset demonstrate that the DA-RNN can outperform state-of-the-art methods for time series prediction.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/366	Yao Qin, Dongjin Song, Haifeng Chen, Wei Cheng, Guofei Jiang, Garrison W.

Improving Stochastic Block Models by Incorporating Power-Law Degree Characteristic	Stochastic block models (SBMs) provide a statistical way modeling network data, especially in representing clusters or community structures. However, most block models do not consider complex characteristics of networks such as scale-free feature, making them incapable of handling degree variation of vertices, which is ubiquitous in real networks. To address this issue, we introduce degree decay variables into SBM, termed power-law degree SBM (PLD-SBM), to model the varying probability of connections between node pairs. The scale-free feature is approximated by a power-law degree characteristic. Such a property allows PLD-SBM to correct the distortion of degree distribution in SBM, and thus improves the performance of cluster prediction. Experiments on both simulated networks and two real-world networks including the Adolescent Health Data and the political blogs network demonstrate the validity of the motivation of PLD-SBM, and its practical superiority.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/365	Maoying Qiao, Jun Yu, Wei Bian, Qiang Li, Dacheng Tao
On Subset Selection with General Cost Constraints	This paper considers the subset selection problem with a monotone objective function and a monotone cost constraint, which relaxes the submodular property of previous studies. We first show that the approximation ratio of the generalized greedy algorithm is $\frac{\alpha}{2}(1 \textendash \frac{1}{e^{\alpha}})$ (where $\alpha$ is the submodularity ratio); and then propose POMC, an anytime randomized iterative approach that can utilize more time to find better solutions than the generalized greedy algorithm. We show that POMC can obtain the same general approximation guarantee as the generalized greedy algorithm, but can achieve better solutions in cases and applications.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/364	Chao Qian, Jing-Cheng Shi, Yang Yu, Ke Tang
Optimizing Ratio of Monotone Set Functions	This paper considers the problem of minimizing the ratio of two set functions, i.e., $f/g$. Previous work assumed monotone and submodular of the two functions, while we consider a more general situation where $g$ is not necessarily submodular. We derive that the greedy approach GreedRatio, as a fixed time algorithm, achieves a $\frac{|X^*|}{(1+(|X^*| \textendash 1)(1 \textendash \kappa_f))\gamma(g)}$ approximation ratio, which also improves the previous bound for submodular $g$. If more time can be spent, we present the PORM algorithm, an anytime randomized iterative approach minimizing $f$ and $\textendash g$ simultaneously. We show that PORM using reasonable time has the same general approximation guarantee as GreedRatio, but can achieve better solutions in cases and applications.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/363	Chao Qian, Jing-Cheng Shi, Yang Yu, Ke Tang, Zhi-Hua Zhou
Boosted Zero-Shot Learning with Semantic Correlation Regularization	We study zero-shot learning (ZSL) as a transfer learning problem, and focus on the two key aspects of ZSL, model effectiveness and model adaptation. For effective modeling, we adopt the boosting strategy to learn a zero-shot classifier from weak models to a strong model. For adaptable knowledge transfer, we devise a Semantic Correlation Regularization (SCR) approach to regularize the boosted model to be consistent with the inter-class semantic correlations. With SCR embedded in the boosting objective, and with a self-controlled sample selection for learning robustness, we propose a unified framework, Boosted Zero-shot classification with Semantic Correlation Regularization (BZ-SCR). By balancing the SCR-regularized boosted model selection and the self-controlled sample selection, BZ-SCR is capable of capturing both discriminative and adaptable feature-to-class semantic alignments, while ensuring the reliability and adaptability of the learned samples. The experiments on two ZSL datasets show the superiority of BZ-SCR over the state-of-the-arts.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/362	Te Pi, Xi Li, Zhongfei (Mark) Zhang
Flexible Orthogonal Neighborhood Preserving Embedding	In this paper, we propose a novel linear subspace learning algorithm called Flexible Orthogonal Neighborhood Preserving Embedding (FONPE), which is a linear approximation of Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) algorithm. Our novel objective function integrates two terms related to manifold smoothness and a flexible penalty defined on the projection fitness. Different from Neighborhood Preserving Embedding (NPE), we relax the hard constraint by modeling the mismatch between the approximate linear embedding and the original nonlinear embedding instead of enforcing them to be equal, which makes it better cope with the data sampled from a nonlinear manifold. Besides, instead of enforcing an orthogonality between the projected points, we enforce the mapping to be orthogonal. By using this method, FONPE tends to preserve distances and thus the overall geometry can be preserved. Unlike LLE, as FONPE has an explicit linear mapping between the input and the reduced spaces, it can handle novel testing data straightforwardly. Moreover, when the projection matrix in our model becomes an identity matrix, our model can be transformed to denoising LLE (DLLE). Compared with the standard LLE, we demonstrate that DLLE can handle data with noise better. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark databases demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/361	Tianji Pang, Feiping Nie, Junwei Han
Learning Homophily Couplings from Non-IID Data for Joint Feature Selection and Noise-Resilient Outlier Detection	This paper introduces a novel wrapper-based outlier detection framework (WrapperOD) and its instance (HOUR) for identifying outliers in noisy data (i.e., data with noisy features) with strong couplings between outlying behaviors. Existing subspace or feature selection-based methods are significantly challenged by such data, as their search of feature subset(s) is independent of outlier scoring and thus can be misled by noisy features. In contrast, HOUR takes a wrapper approach to iteratively optimize the feature subset selection and outlier scoring using a top-k outlier ranking evaluation measure as its objective function. HOUR learns homophily couplings between outlying behaviors (i.e., abnormal behaviors are not independent - they bond together) in constructing a noise-resilient outlier scoring function to produce a reliable outlier ranking in each iteration. We show that HOUR (i) retains a 2-approximation outlier ranking to the optimal one; and (ii) significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art competitors on 15 real-world data sets with different noise levels in terms of AUC and/or P@n. The source code of HOUR is available at https://sites.google.com/site/gspangsite/sourcecode.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/360	Guansong Pang, Longbing Cao, Ling Chen, Huan Liu
Discovering Relevance-Dependent Bicluster Structure from Relational Data	In this paper, we propose a statistical model for relevance-dependent biclustering to analyze relational data. The proposed model factorizes relational data into bicluster structure with two features: (1) each object in a cluster has a relevance value, which indicates how strongly the object relates to the cluster and (2) all clusters are related to at least one dense block. These features simplify the task of understanding the meaning of each cluster because only a few highly relevant objects need to be inspected. We introduced the Relevance-Dependent Bernoulli Distribution (R-BD) as a prior for relevance-dependent binary matrices and proposed the novel Relevance-Dependent Infinite Biclustering (R-IB) model, which automatically estimates the number of clusters. Posterior inference can be performed efficiently using a collapsed Gibbs sampler because the parameters of the R-IB model can be fully marginalized out. Experimental results show that the R-IB extracts more essential bicluster structure with better computational efficiency than conventional models. We further observed that the biclustering results obtained by R-IB facilitate interpretation of the meaning of each cluster.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/359	Iku Ohama, Takuya Kida, Hiroki Arimura
SEVEN: Deep Semi-supervised Verification Networks	Verification determines whether two samples belong to the same class or not, and has important applications such as face and fingerprint verification, where thousands or millions of categories are present but each category has scarce labeled examples, presenting two major challenges for existing deep learning models. We propose a deep semi-supervised model named SEmi-supervised VErification Network (SEVEN) to address these challenges. The model consists of two complementary components. The generative component addresses the lack of supervision within each category by learning general salient structures from a large amount of data across categories. The discriminative component exploits the learned general features to mitigate the lack of supervision within categories, and also directs the generative component to find more informative structures of the whole data manifold. The two components are tied together in SEVEN to allow an end-to-end training of the two components. Extensive experiments on four verification tasks demonstrate that SEVEN significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art deep semi-supervised techniques when labeled data are in short supply. Furthermore, SEVEN is competitive with fully supervised baselines trained with a larger amount of labeled data. It indicates the importance of the generative component in SEVEN.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/358	Vahid Noroozi, Lei Zheng, Sara Bahaadini, Sihong Xie, Philip S. Yu
Self-weighted Multiview Clustering with Multiple Graphs	In multiview learning, it is essential to assign a reasonable weight to each view according to its importance. Thus, for multiview clustering task, a wise and elegant method should achieve clustering multiview data while learning the view weights. In this paper, we address this problem by exploring a Laplacian rank constrained graph, which can be approximately as the centroid of the built graph for each view with different confidences. We start our work with a natural thought that the weights can be learned by introducing a hyperparameter. By analyzing the weakness of it, we further propose a new multiview clustering method which is totally self-weighted. Furthermore, once the target graph is obtained in our models, we can directly assign the cluster label to each data point and do not need any postprocessing such as $K$-means in standard spectral clustering. Evaluations on two synthetic datasets prove the effectiveness of our methods. Compared with several representative graph-based multiview clustering approaches on four real-world datasets, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve the better performances and our new clustering method is more practical to use.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/357	Feiping Nie, Jing Li, Xuelong Li
Joint Capped Norms Minimization for Robust Matrix Recovery	The low-rank matrix recovery is an important machine learning research topic with various scientific applications. Most existing low-rank matrix recovery methods relax the rank minimization problem via the trace norm minimization. However, such a relaxation makes the solution seriously deviate from the original one. Meanwhile, most matrix recovery methods minimize the squared prediction errors on the observed entries, which is sensitive to outliers. In this paper, we propose a new robust matrix recovery model to address the above two challenges. The joint capped trace norm and capped $\ell_1$-norm are used to tightly approximate the rank minimization and enhance the robustness to outliers. The evaluation experiments are performed on both synthetic data and real world applications in collaborative filtering and social network link prediction. All empirical results show our new method outperforms the existing matrix recovery methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/356	Feiping Nie, Zhouyuan Huo, Heng Huang
Discriminative Bayesian Nonparametric Clustering	We propose a general framework for discriminative Bayesian nonparametric clustering to promote the inter-discrimination among the learned clusters in a fully Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) manner. Our method combines existing BNP clustering and discriminative models by enforcing latent cluster indices to be consistent with the predicted labels resulted from probabilistic discriminative model. This formulation results in a well-defined generative process wherein we can use either logistic regression or SVM for discrimination. Using the proposed framework, we develop two novel discriminative BNP variants: the discriminative Dirichlet process mixtures, and the discriminative-state infinite HMMs for sequential data. We develop efficient data-augmentation Gibbs samplers for posterior inference. Extensive experiments in image clustering and dynamic location clustering demonstrate that by encouraging discrimination between induced clusters, our model enhances the quality of clustering in comparison with the traditional generative BNP models.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/355	Vu Nguyen, Dinh Phung, Trung Le, Hung Bui
Large-scale Online Kernel Learning with Random Feature Reparameterization	"A typical online kernel learning method faces two fundamental issues: the complexity in dealing with a huge number of observed data points (a.k.a the curse of kernelization) and the difficulty in learning kernel parameters, which often assumed to be fixed. Random Fourier feature is a recent and effective approach to address the former by approximating the shift-invariant kernel function via Bocher's theorem, and allows the model to be maintained directly in the random feature space with a fixed dimension, hence the model size remains constant w.r.t. data size. We further introduce in this paper the reparameterized random feature (RRF), a random feature framework for large-scale online kernel learning to address both aforementioned challenges. Our initial intuition comes from the so-called ""reparameterization trick"" [Kingma et al., 2014] to lift the source of randomness of Fourier components to another space which can be independently sampled, so that stochastic gradient of the kernel parameters can be analytically derived. We develop a well-founded underlying theory for our method, including a general way to reparameterize the kernel, and a new tighter error bound on the approximation quality. This view further inspires a direct application of stochastic gradient descent for updating our model under an online learning setting. We then conducted extensive experiments on several large-scale datasets where we demonstrate that our work achieves state-of-the-art performance in both learning efficacy and efficiency."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/354	Tu Dinh Nguyen, Trung Le, Hung Bui, Dinh Phung
Autonomous Task Sequencing for Customized Curriculum Design in Reinforcement Learning	Transfer learning is a method where an agent reuses knowledge learned in a source task to improve learning on a target task. Recent work has shown that transfer learning can be extended to the idea of curriculum learning, where the agent incrementally accumulates knowledge over a sequence of tasks (i.e. a curriculum). In most existing work, such curricula have been constructed manually. Furthermore, they are fixed ahead of time, and do not adapt to the progress or abilities of the agent. In this paper, we formulate the design of a curriculum as a Markov Decision Process, which directly models the accumulation of knowledge as an agent interacts with tasks, and propose a method that approximates an execution of an optimal policy in this MDP to produce an agent-specific curriculum. We use our approach to automatically sequence tasks for 3 agents with varying sensing and action capabilities in an experimental domain, and show that our method produces curricula customized for each agent that improve performance relative to learning from scratch or using a different agent's curriculum.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/353	Sanmit Narvekar, Jivko Sinapov, Peter Stone
Learning Feature Engineering for Classification	Feature engineering is the task of improving predictive modelling performance on a dataset by transforming its feature space. Existing approaches to automate this process rely on either transformed feature space exploration through evaluation-guided search, or explicit expansion of datasets with all transformed features followed by feature selection. Such approaches incur high computational costs in runtime and/or memory. We present a novel technique, called Learning Feature Engineering (LFE), for automating feature engineering in classification tasks. LFE is based on learning the effectiveness of applying a transformation (e.g., arithmetic or aggregate operators) on numerical features, from past feature engineering experiences. Given a new dataset, LFE recommends a set of useful transformations to be applied on features without relying on model evaluation or explicit feature expansion and selection. Using a collection of datasets, we train a set of neural networks, which aim at predicting the transformation that impacts classification performance positively. Our empirical results show that LFE outperforms other feature engineering approaches for an overwhelming majority (89%) of the datasets from various sources while incurring a substantially lower computational cost.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/352	Fatemeh Nargesian, Horst Samulowitz, Udayan Khurana, Elias B.

Self-Paced Multitask Learning with Shared Knowledge	This paper introduces self-paced task selection to multitask learning, where instances from more closely related tasks are selected in a progression of easier-to-harder tasks, to emulate an effective human education strategy, but applied to multitask machine learning. We develop the mathematical foundation for the approach based on iterative selection of the most appropriate task, learning the task parameters, and updating the shared knowledge, optimizing a new bi-convex loss function. This proposed method applies quite generally, including to multitask feature learning, multitask learning with alternating structure optimization, etc. Results show that in each of the above formulations self-paced (easier-to-harder) task selection outperforms the baseline version of these methods in all the experiments.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/351	Keerthiram Murugesan, Jaime Carbonell
Thresholding Bandits with Augmented UCB	In this paper we propose the Augmented-UCB (AugUCB) algorithm for a fixed-budget version of the thresholding bandit problem (TBP), where the objective is to identify a set of arms whose quality is above a threshold. A key feature of AugUCB is that it uses both mean and variance estimates to eliminate arms that have been sufficiently explored; to the best of our knowledge this is the first algorithm to employ such an approach for the considered TBP. Theoretically, we obtain an upper bound on the loss (probability of mis-classification) incurred by AugUCB. Although UCBEV in literature provides a better guarantee, it is important to emphasize that UCBEV has access to problem complexity (whose computation requires arms' mean and variances), and hence is not realistic in practice; this is in contrast to AugUCB whose implementation does not require any such complexity inputs. We conduct extensive simulation experiments to validate the performance of AugUCB. Through our simulation work, we establish that AugUCB, owing to its utilization of variance estimates, performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art APT, CSAR and other non variance-based algorithms.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/350	Subhojyoti Mukherjee, Naveen Kolar Purushothama, Nandan Sudarsanam, Balaraman Ravindran
Completely Heterogeneous Transfer Learning with Attention - What And What Not To Transfer	"We study a transfer learning framework where source and target datasets are heterogeneous in both feature and label spaces. Specifically, we do not assume explicit relations between source and target tasks a priori, and thus it is crucial to determine what and what not to transfer from source knowledge. Towards this goal, we define a new heterogeneous transfer learning approach that (1) selects and attends to an optimized subset of source samples to transfer knowledge from, and (2) builds a unified transfer network that learns from both source and target knowledge. This method, termed ""Attentional Heterogeneous Transfer"", along with a newly proposed unsupervised transfer loss, improve upon the previous state-of-the-art approaches on extensive simulations as well as a challenging hetero-lingual text classification task."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/349	Seungwhan Moon, Jaime Carbonell
Rescale-Invariant SVM for Binary Classification	Support Vector Machines (SVM) are among the most well-known machine learning methods, with broad use in different scientific areas. However, one necessary pre-processing phase for SVM is normalization (scaling) of features, since SVM is not invariant to the scales of the features' spaces, i.e., different ways of scaling may lead to different results. We define a more robust decision-making approach for binary classification, in which one sample strongly belongs to a class if it belongs to that class for all possible rescalings of features. We derive a way of characterising the approach for binary SVM that allows determining when an instance strongly belongs to a class and when the classification is invariant to rescaling. The characterisation leads to a computation method to determine whether one sample is strongly positive, strongly negative or neither. Our experimental results back up the intuition that being strongly positive suggests stronger confidence that an instance really is positive.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/348	Mojtaba Montazery, Nic Wilson
Beyond the Nystrom Approximation: Speeding up Spectral Clustering using Uniform Sampling and Weighted Kernel k-means	In this paper we present a framework for spectral clustering based on the following simple scheme: sample a subset of the input points, compute the clusters for the sampled subset using weighted kernel k-means (Dhillon et al. 2004) and use the resulting centers to compute a clustering for the remaining data points. For the case where the points are sampled uniformly at random without replacement, we show that the number of samples required depends mainly on the number of clusters and the diameter of the set of points in the kernel space. Experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms the approaches based on the Nystrom approximation both in terms of accuracy and computation time.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/347	Mahesh Mohan, Claire Monteleoni
Logistic Markov Decision Processes	User modeling in advertising and recommendation has typically focused on myopic predictors of user responses. In this work, we consider the long-term decision problem associated with user interaction. We propose a concise specification of long-term interaction dynamics by combining factored dynamic Bayesian networks with logistic predictors of user responses, allowing state-of-the-art prediction models to be seamlessly extended. We show how to solve such models at scale by providing a constraint generation approach for approximate linear programming that overcomes the variable coupling and non-linearity induced by the logistic regression predictor. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated on advertising domains with up to 2^54 states and 2^39 actions.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/346	Martin Mladenov, Craig Boutilier, Dale Schuurmans, Ofer Meshi, Gal Elidan, Tyler Lu
Exemplar-centered Supervised Shallow Parametric Data Embedding	Metric learning methods for dimensionality reduction in combination with k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) have been extensively deployed in many classification, data embedding, and information retrieval applications. However, most of these approaches involve pairwise training data comparisons, and thus have quadratic computational complexity with respect to the size of training set, preventing them from scaling to fairly big datasets. Moreover, during testing, comparing test data against all the training data points is also expensive in terms of both computational cost and resources required. Furthermore, previous metrics are either too constrained or too expressive to be well learned. To effectively solve these issues, we present an exemplar-centered supervised shallow parametric data embedding model, using a Maximally Collapsing Metric Learning (MCML) objective. Our strategy learns a shallow high-order parametric embedding function and compares training/test data only with learned or precomputed exemplars, resulting in a cost function with linear computational complexity for both training and testing. We also empirically demonstrate, using several benchmark datasets, that for classification in two-dimensional embedding space, our approach not only gains speedup of kNN by hundreds of times, but also outperforms state-of-the-art supervised embedding approaches.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/345	Martin Renqiang Min, Hongyu Guo, Dongjin Song
Count-Based Exploration in Feature Space for Reinforcement Learning	We introduce a new count-based optimistic exploration algorithm for Reinforcement Learning (RL) that is feasible in environments with high-dimensional state-action spaces. The success of RL algorithms in these domains depends crucially on generalisation from limited training experience. Function approximation techniques enable RL agents to generalise in order to estimate the value of unvisited states, but at present few methods enable generalisation regarding uncertainty. This has prevented the combination of scalable RL algorithms with efficient exploration strategies that drive the agent to reduce its uncertainty. We present a new method for computing a generalised state visit-count, which allows the agent to estimate the uncertainty associated with any state. Our \phi-pseudocount achieves generalisation by exploiting same feature representation of the state space that is used for value function approximation. States that have less frequently observed features are deemed more uncertain. The \phi-Exploration-Bonus algorithm rewards the agent for exploring in feature space rather than in the untransformed state space. The method is simpler and less computationally expensive than some previous proposals, and achieves near state-of-the-art results on high-dimensional RL benchmarks.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/344	Jarryd Martin, Suraj  Narayanan S., Tom Everitt, Marcus Hutter
Cross-Domain Recommendation: An Embedding and Mapping Approach	Data sparsity is one of the most challenging problems for recommender systems. One promising solution to this problem is cross-domain recommendation, i.e., leveraging feedbacks or ratings from multiple domains to improve recommendation performance in a collective manner. In this paper, we propose an Embedding and Mapping framework for Cross-Domain Recommendation, called EMCDR. The proposed EMCDR framework distinguishes itself from existing cross-domain recommendation models in two aspects. First, a multi-layer perceptron is used to capture the nonlinear mapping function across domains, which offers high flexibility for learning domain-specific features of entities in each domain. Second, only the entities with sufficient data are used to learn the mapping function, guaranteeing its robustness to noise caused by data sparsity in single domain. Extensive experiments on two cross-domain recommendation scenarios demonstrate that EMCDR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain recommendation methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/343	Tong Man, Huawei Shen, Xiaolong Jin, Xueqi Cheng
WALKING WALKing walking: Action Recognition from Action Echoes	Recognizing human actions represented by 3D trajectories of skeleton joints is a challenging machine learning task. In this paper, the 3D skeleton sequences are regarded as multivariate time series, and their dynamics and multiscale features are efficiently learned from action echo states. Specifically, first the skeleton data from the limbs and trunk are projected into five high dimensional nonlinear spaces, that are randomly generated by five dynamic, training-free recurrent networks, i.e., the reservoirs of echo state networks (ESNs). In this way, the history of the time series is represented as nonlinear echo states of actions. We then use a single multiscale convolutional layer to extract multiscale features from the echo states, and maintain multiscale temporal invariance by a max-over-time pooling layer. We propose two multi-step fusion strategies to integrate the spatial information over the five parts of the human physical structure. Finally, we learn the label distribution using softmax. With one training-free recurrent layer and only layer of convolution, our Convolutional Echo State Network (ConvESN) is a very efficient end-to-end model, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four skeleton benchmark data sets.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/342	Qianli Ma, Lifeng Shen, Enhuan Chen, Shuai Tian, Jiabing Wang, Garrison W.

General Heterogeneous Transfer Distance Metric Learning via Knowledge Fragments Transfer	Transfer learning aims to improve the performance of target learning task by leveraging information (or transferring knowledge) from other related tasks. Recently, transfer distance metric learning (TDML) has attracted lots of interests, but most of these methods assume that feature representations for the source and target learning tasks are the same. Hence, they are not suitable for the applications, in which the data are from heterogeneous domains (feature spaces, modalities and even semantics). Although some existing heterogeneous transfer learning (HTL) approaches is able to handle such domains, they lack flexibility in real-world applications, and the learned transformations are often restricted to be linear. We therefore develop a general and flexible heterogeneous TDML (HTDML) framework based on the knowledge fragment transfer strategy. In the proposed HTDML, any (linear or nonlinear) distance metric learning algorithms can be employed to learn the source metric beforehand. Then a set of knowledge fragments are extracted from the pre-learned source metric to help target metric learning. In addition, either linear or nonlinear distance metric can be learned for the target domain. Extensive experiments on both scene classification and object recognition demonstrate superiority of the proposed method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/341	Yong Luo, Yonggang Wen, Tongliang Liu, Dacheng Tao
Exploiting High-Order Information in Heterogeneous Multi-Task Feature Learning	Multi-task feature learning (MTFL) aims to improve the generalization performance of multiple related learning tasks by sharing features between them. It has been successfully applied to many pattern recognition and biometric prediction problems. Most of current MTFL methods assume that different tasks exploit the same feature representation, and thus are not applicable to the scenarios where data are drawn from heterogeneous domains. Existing heterogeneous transfer learning (including multi-task learning) approaches handle multiple heterogeneous domains by usually learning feature transformations across different domains, but they ignore the high-order statistics (correlation information) which can only be discovered by simultaneously exploring all domains. We therefore develop a tensor based heterogeneous MTFL (THMTFL) framework to exploit such high-order information. Specifically, feature transformations of all domains are learned together, and finally used to derive new representations. A connection between all domains is built by using the transformations to project the pre-learned predictive structures of different domains into a common subspace, and minimizing their divergence in the subspace. By exploring the high-order information, the proposed THMTFL can obtain more reliable feature transformations compared with existing heterogeneous transfer learning approaches. Extensive experiments on both text categorization and social image annotation demonstrate superiority of the proposed method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/340	Yong Luo, Dacheng Tao, Yonggang Wen
Symmetric Non-negative Latent Factor Models for Undirected Large Networks	Undirected, high dimensional and sparse networks are frequently encountered in industrial applications. They contain rich knowledge regarding various useful patterns. Non-negative latent factor (NLF) models have proven to be effective and efficient in acquiring useful knowledge from asymmetric networks. However, they cannot correctly describe the symmetry of an undirected network. For addressing this issue, this work analyzes the NLF extraction processes on asymmetric and symmetric matrices respectively, thereby innovatively achieving the symmetric and non-negative latent factor (SNLF) models for undirected, high dimensional and sparse networks. The proposed SNLF models are equipped with a) high efficiency, b) non-negativity, and c) symmetry. Experimental results on real networks show that they are able to a) represent the symmetry of the target network rigorously; b) maintain the non-negativity of resulting latent factors; and c) achieve high computational efficiency when performing data analysis tasks as missing data estimation.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/339	Xin Luo, Ming-Sheng  Shang
EigenNet: Towards Fast and Structural Learning of Deep Neural Networks	Deep Neural Network (DNN) is difficult to train and easy to overfit in training. We address these two issues by introducing EigenNet, an architecture that not only accelerates training but also adjusts number of hidden neurons to reduce over-fitting. They are achieved by whitening the information flows of DNNs and removing those eigenvectors that may capture noises. The former improves conditioning of the Fisher information matrix, whilst the latter increases generalization capability. These appealing properties of EigenNet can benefit many recent DNN structures, such as network in network and inception, by wrapping their hidden layers into the layers of EigenNet. The modeling capacities of the original networks are preserved. Both the training wall-clock time and number of updates are reduced by using EigenNet, compared to stochastic gradient descent on various datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/338	Ping Luo
Adaptive Semi-Supervised Learning with Discriminative Least Squares Regression	Semi-supervised learning plays a significant role in multi-class classification, where a small number of labeled data are more deterministic while substantial unlabeled data might cause large uncertainties and potential threats. In this paper, we distinguish the label fitting of labeled and unlabeled training data through a probabilistic vector with an adaptive parameter, which always ensures the significant importance of labeled data and characterizes the contribution of unlabeled instance according to its uncertainty. Instead of using traditional least squares regression (LSR) for classification, we develop a new discriminative LSR by equipping each label with an adjustment vector. This strategy avoids incorrect penalization on samples that are far away from the boundary and simultaneously facilitates multi-class classification by enlarging the geometrical distance of instances belonging to different classes. An efficient alternative algorithm is exploited to solve the proposed model with closed form solution for each updating rule. We also analyze the convergence and complexity of the proposed algorithm theoretically. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model for multi-class classification tasks.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/337	Minnan Luo, Lingling Zhang, Feiping Nie, Xiaojun Chang, Buyue Qian, Qinghua Zheng
Tracking the Evolution of Customer Purchase Behavior Segmentation via a Fragmentation-Coagulation Process	Customer behavior modeling is important for businesses in order to understand, attract and retain customers. It is critical that the models are able to track the dynamics of customer behavior over time. We propose FC-CSM, a Customer Segmentation Model based on a Fragmentation-Coagulation process, which can track the evolution of customer segmentation, including the splitting and merging of customer groups. We conduct a case study using transaction data from a major Australian supermarket chain, where we: 1) show that our model achieves high fitness of purchase rate, outperforming models using mixture of Poisson processes; 2) compare the impact of promotions on customers for different products; and 3) track how customer groups evolve over time and how individual customers shift across groups. Our model provides valuable information to stakeholders about the different types of customers, how they change purchase behavior, and which customers are more receptive to promotion campaigns.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/336	Ling Luo, Bin Li, Irena Koprinska, Shlomo Berkovsky, Fang Chen
Image Matching via Loopy RNN	Most existing matching algorithms are one-off algorithms, i.e., they usually measure the distance between the two image feature representation vectors for only one time. In contrast, human's vision system achieves this task, i.e., image matching, by recursively looking at specific/related parts of both images and then making the final judgement. Towards this end, we propose a novel loopy recurrent neural network (Loopy RNN), which is capable of aggregating relationship information of two input images in a progressive/iterative manner and outputting the consolidated matching score in the final iteration. A Loopy RNN features two uniqueness. First, built on conventional long short-term memory (LSTM) nodes, it links the output gate of the tail node to the input gate of the head node, thus it brings up symmetry property required for matching. Second, a monotonous loss designed for the proposed network guarantees increasing confidence during the recursive matching process. Extensive experiments on several image matching benchmarks demonstrate the great potential of the proposed method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/335	Donghao Luo, Bingbing Ni, Yichao Yan, Xiaokang Yang
Sampling for Approximate Maximum Search in Factorized Tensor	Factorization models have been extensively used for recovering the missing entries of a matrix or tensor. However, directly computing all of the entries using the learned factorization models is prohibitive when the size of the matrix/tensor is large. On the other hand, in many applications, such as collaborative filtering, we are only interested in a few entries that are the largest among them. In this work, we propose a sampling-based approach for finding the top entries of a tensor which is decomposed by the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC model. We develop an algorithm to sample the entries with probabilities proportional to their values. We further extend it to make the sampling proportional to the $k$-th power of the values, amplifying the focus on the top ones. We provide theoretical analysis of the sampling algorithm and evaluate its performance on several real-world data sets. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is orders of magnitude faster than exhaustive computing. When applied to the special case of searching in a matrix, it also requires fewer samples than the other state-of-the-art method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/334	Zhi Lu, Yang Hu, Bing Zeng
Dynamic Weighted Majority for Incremental Learning of Imbalanced Data Streams with Concept Drift	Concept drifts occurring in data streams will jeopardize the accuracy and stability of the online learning process. If the data stream is imbalanced, it will be even more challenging to detect and cure the concept drift. In the literature, these two problems have been intensively addressed separately, but have yet to be well studied when they occur together. In this paper, we propose a chunk-based incremental learning method called Dynamic Weighted Majority for Imbalance Learning (DWMIL) to deal with the data streams with concept drift and class imbalance problem. DWMIL utilizes an ensemble framework by dynamically weighting the base classifiers according to their performance on the current data chunk. Compared with the existing methods, its merits are four-fold: (1) it can keep stable for non-drifted streams and quickly adapt to the new concept; (2) it is totally incremental, i.e. no previous data needs to be stored; (3) it keeps a limited number of classifiers to ensure high efficiency; and (4) it is simple and needs only one thresholding parameter. Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets with concept drift show that DWMIL performs better than the state-of-the-art competitors, with less computational cost.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/333	Yang Lu, Yiu-ming Cheung, Yuan Yan Tang
JM-Net and Cluster-SVM for Aerial Scene Classification	Aerial scene classification, which is a fundamental problem for remote sensing imagery, can automatically label an aerial image with a specific semantic category. Although deep learning has achieved competitive performance for aerial scene classification, training the conventional neural networks with aerial datasets will easily stick in overtting and local minimum. Because the aerial datasets only contain a few hundreds or thousands images, meanwhile the conventional networks usually contain millions of parameters to be trained. To address the problem, a novel convolutional neural network named JM-Net is proposed in this paper, which has different size of convolution kernels in same layer and ignores the fully convolytion layer, so it has fewer parameters and can be trained well on aerial datasets. Additionally, Cluster-SVM, a strategy to improve the accuracy and speed up the classification is used in the specific task. Finally, our method suparssed the state-of-art result on the challenging AID dataset while cost shorter time and used smaller storage space.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/332	Xiaoqiang Lu, Yuan Yuan, Jie Fang
Learning User Dependencies for Recommendation	Social recommender systems exploit users' social relationships to improve recommendation accuracy. Intuitively, a user tends to trust different people regarding with different scenarios. Therefore, one main challenge of social recommendation is to exploit the most appropriate dependencies between users for a given recommendation task. Previous social recommendation methods are usually developed based on pre-defined user dependencies. Thus, they may not be optimal for a specific recommendation task. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation method, named probabilistic relational matrix factorization (PRMF), which can automatically learn the dependencies between users to improve recommendation accuracy. In PRMF, users' latent features are assumed to follow a matrix variate normal (MVN) distribution. Both positive and negative user dependencies can be modeled by the row precision matrix of the MVN distribution. Moreover, we also propose an alternating optimization algorithm to solve the optimization problem of PRMF. Extensive experiments on four real datasets have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PRMF model.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/331	Yong Liu, Peilin Zhao, Xin Liu, Min Wu, Lixin Duan, Xiao-Li Li
Deep Ordinal Regression Based on Data Relationship for Small Datasets	Ordinal regression aims to classify instances into ordinal categories. As with other supervised learning problems, learning an effective deep ordinal model from a small dataset is challenging. This paper proposes a new approach which transforms the ordinal regression problem to binary classification problems and uses triplets with instances from different categories to train deep neural networks such that high-level features describing their ordinal relationship can be extracted automatically. In the testing phase, triplets are formed by a testing instance and other instances with known ranks. A decoder is designed to estimate the rank of the testing instance based on the outputs of the network. Because of the data argumentation by permutation, deep learning can work for ordinal regression even on small datasets. Experimental results on the historical color image benchmark and MSRA image search datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional deep learning approach and is comparable with other state-of-the-art methods, which are highly based on prior knowledge to design effective features.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/330	Yanzhu Liu, Adams Wai Kin Kong, Chi Keong Goh
Understanding How Feature Structure Transfers in Transfer Learning	Transfer learning transfers knowledge across domains to improve the learning performance. Since feature structures generally represent the common knowledge across different domains, they can be transferred successfully even though the labeling functions across domains differ arbitrarily. However, theoretical justification for this success has remained elusive. In this paper, motivated by self-taught learning, we regard a set of bases as a feature structure of a domain if the bases can (approximately) reconstruct any observation in this domain. We propose a general analysis scheme to theoretically justify that if the source and target domains share similar feature structures, the source domain feature structure is transferable to the target domain, regardless of the change of the labeling functions across domains. The transferred structure is interpreted to function as a regularization matrix which benefits the learning process of the target domain task. We prove that such transfer enables the corresponding learning algorithms to be uniformly stable. Specifically, we illustrate the existence of feature structure transfer in two well-known transfer learning settings: domain adaptation and learning to learn.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/329	Tongliang Liu, Qiang Yang, Dacheng Tao
Adaptive Group Sparse Multi-task Learning via Trace Lasso	In multi-task learning (MTL), tasks are learned jointly so that information among related tasks is shared and utilized to help improve generalization for each individual task. A major challenge in MTL is how to selectively choose what to share among tasks. Ideally, only related tasks should share information with each other. In this paper, we propose a new MTL method that can adaptively group correlated tasks into clusters and share information among the correlated tasks only. Our method is based on the assumption that each task parameter is a linear combination of other tasks' and the coefficients of the linear combination are active only if there is relatedness between the two tasks. Through introducing trace Lasso penalty on these coefficients, our method is able to adaptively select the subset of coefficients with respect to the tasks that are correlated to the task. Our model frees the process of determining task clustering structure as used in the literature. Efficient optimization methods based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to solve the problem. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of clustering related tasks and generalization performance.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/328	Sulin Liu, Sinno Jialin Pan
Learning Concise Representations of Users' Influences through Online Behaviors	Whereas it is well known that social network users influence each other, a fundamental problem in influence maximization, opinion formation and viral marketing is that users' influences are difficult to quantify. Previous work has directly defined an independent model parameter to capture the interpersonal influence between each pair of users. However, such models do not consider how influences depend on each other if they originate from the same user or if they act on the same user. To do so, these models need a parameter for each pair of users, which results in high-dimensional models becoming easily trapped into the overfitting problem. Given these problems, another way of defining the parameters is needed to consider the dependencies. Thus we propose a model that defines parameters for every user with a latent influence vector and a susceptibility vector. Such low-dimensional and distributed representations naturally cause the interpersonal influences involving the same user to be coupled with each other, thus reducing the model's complexity. Additionally, the model can easily consider the sentimental polarities of users' messages and how sentiment affects users' influences. In this study, we conduct extensive experiments on real Microblog data, showing that our model with distributed representations achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art and pair-wise models, and that learning influences on sentiments benefit performance.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/327	Shenghua Liu, Houdong Zheng, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng, Xiangwen Liao
Cause-Effect Knowledge Acquisition and Neural Association Model for Solving A Set of Winograd Schema Problems	This paper focuses on the investigations in Winograd Schema (WS), a challenging problem which has been proposed for measuring progress in commonsense reasoning.Due to the lack of commonsense knowledge and training data, very little work has been found on the WS problems in recent years.Actually, there is no shortcut to solve this problem except to collect more commonsense knowledge and design suitable models.Therefore, this paper addresses a set of WS problems by proposing a knowledge acquisition method and a general neural association model.To avoid the sparseness issue, the knowledge we aim to collect is the cause-effect relationships between thousands of commonly used words.The knowledge acquisition method supports us to extract hundreds of thousands of cause-effect pairs from large text corpus automatically.Meanwhile, a neural association model (NAM) is proposed to encode the association relationships between any two discrete events.Based on the extracted knowledge and the NAM models, in this paper, we successfully build a system for solving WS problems from scratch and achieve 70.0% accuracy.Most importantly, this paper provides a flexible framework to solve WS problems based on event association and neural network methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/326	Quan Liu, Hui Jiang, Andrew Evdokimov, Zhen-Hua Ling, Xiaodan Zhu, Si Wei, Yu Hu
Accelerated Local Anomaly Detection via Resolving Attributed Networks	Attributed networks, in which network connectivity and node attributes are available, have been increasingly used to model real-world information systems, such as social media and e-commerce platforms. While outlier detection has been extensively studied to identify anomalies that deviate from certain chosen background, existing algorithms cannot be directly applied on attributed networks due to the heterogeneous types of information and the scale of real-world data. Meanwhile, it has been observed that local anomalies, which may align with global condition, are hard to be detected by existing algorithms with interpretability. Motivated by the observations, in this paper, we propose to study the problem of effective and efficient local anomaly detection in attributed networks. In particular, we design a collective way for modeling heterogeneous network and attribute information, and develop a novel and efficient distributed optimization algorithm to handle large-scale data. In the experiments, we compare the proposed framework with the state-of-the-art methods on both real and synthetic datasets, and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency through quantitative evaluation and case studies.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/325	Ninghao Liu, Xiao Huang, Xia Hu
Improving Learning-from-Crowds through Expert Validation	Although several effective learning-from-crowd methods have been developed to infer correct labels from noisy crowdsourced labels, a method for post-processed expert validation is still needed. This paper introduces a semi-supervised learning algorithm that is capable of selecting the most informative instances and maximizing the influence of expert labels. Specifically, we have developed a complete uncertainty assessment to facilitate the selection of the most informative instances. The expert labels are then propagated to similar instances via regularized Bayesian inference. Experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets indicate that given a specific accuracy goal (e.g., 95%) our method reduces expert effort from 39% to 60% compared with the state-of-the-art method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/324	Mengchen Liu, Liu Jiang, Junlin Liu, Xiting Wang, Jun Zhu, Shixia Liu
Fast SVM Trained by Divide-and-Conquer Anchors	Supporting vector machine (SVM) is the most frequently used classifier for machine learning tasks. However, its training time could become cumbersome when the size of training data is very large. Thus, many kinds of representative subsets are chosen from the original dataset to reduce the training complexity. In this paper, we propose to choose the representative points which are noted as anchors obtained from non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) in a divide-and-conquer framework, and then use the anchors to train an approximate SVM. Our theoretical analysis shows that the solving the DCA-SVM can yield an approximate solution close to the primal SVM. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that our DCA-SVM is faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms without notably decreasing the accuracy of classification results.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/323	Meng Liu, Chang Xu, Chao Xu, Dacheng Tao
Modeling Hebb Learning Rule for Unsupervised Learning	This paper presents to model the Hebb learning rule and proposes a neuron learning machine (NLM). Hebb learning rule describes the plasticity of the connection between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons and it is unsupervised itself. It formulates the updating gradient of the connecting weight in artificial neural networks. In this paper, we construct an objective function via modeling the Hebb rule. We make a hypothesis to simplify the model and introduce a correlation based constraint according to the hypothesis and stability of solutions. By analysis from the perspectives of maintaining abstract information and increasing the energy based probability of observed data, we find that this biologically inspired model has the capability of learning useful features. NLM can also be stacked to learn hierarchical features and reformulated into convolutional version to extract features from 2-dimensional data. Experiments on single-layer and deep networks demonstrate the effectiveness of NLM in unsupervised feature learning.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/322	Jia Liu, Maoguo Gong, Qiguang Miao
Semi-supervised Orthogonal Graph Embedding with Recursive Projections	Many graph based semi-supervised dimensionality reduction algorithms utilize the projection matrix to linearly map the data matrix from the original feature space to a lower dimensional representation. But the dimensionality after reduction is inevitably restricted to the number of classes, and the learned non-orthogonal projection matrix usually fails to preserve distances well and balance the weight on different projection direction. This paper proposes a novel dimensionality reduction method, called the semi-supervised orthogonal graph embedding with recursive projections (SOGE). We integrate the manifold smoothness and label fitness as well as the penalization of the linear mapping mismatch, and learn the orthogonal projection on the Stiefel manifold that empirically demonstrates better performance. Moreover, we recursively update the projection matrix in its orthocomplemented space to continuously learn more projection vectors, so as to better control the dimension of reduction. Comprehensive experiment on several benchmarks demonstrates the significant improvement over the existing methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/321	Hanyang Liu, Junwei Han, Feiping Nie
DeepFacade: A Deep Learning Approach to Facade Parsing	The parsing of building facades is a key component to the problem of 3D street scenes reconstruction, which is long desired in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based method for segmenting a facade into semantic categories. Man-made structures often present the characteristic of symmetry. Based on this observation, we propose a symmetric regularizer for training the neural network. Our proposed method can make use of both the power of deep neural networks and the structure of man-made architectures. We also propose a method to refine the segmentation results using bounding boxes generated by the Region Proposal Network. We test our method by training a FCN-8s network with the novel loss function. Experimental results show that our method has outperformed previous state-of-the-art methods significantly on both the ECP dataset and the eTRIMS dataset. As far as we know, we are the first to employ end-to-end deep convolutional neural network on full image scale in the task of building facades parsing.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/320	Hantang Liu, Jialiang Zhang, Jianke Zhu, Steven C.

Locally Linear Factorization Machines	Factorization Machines (FMs) are a widely used method for efficiently using high-order feature interactions in classification and regression tasks. Unfortunately, despite increasing interests in FMs, existing work only considers high order information of the input features which limits their capacities in non-linear problems and fails to capture the underlying structures of more complex data. In this work, we present a novel Locally Linear Factorization Machines (LLFM) which overcomes this limitation by exploring local coding technique. Unlike existing local coding classifiers that involve a phase of unsupervised anchor point learning and predefined local coding scheme which is suboptimal as the class label information is not exploited in discovering the encoding and thus can result in a suboptimal encoding for prediction, we formulate a joint optimization over the anchor points, local coding coordinates and FMs variables to minimize classification or regression risk. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach achieves much better predictive accuracy than other competitive methods which employ LLFM with unsupervised anchor point learning and predefined local coding scheme.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/319	Chenghao Liu, Teng Zhang, Peilin Zhao, Jun Zhou, Jianling Sun
Deep Neural Networks for High Dimension, Low Sample Size Data	Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved breakthroughs in applications with large sample size. However, when facing high dimension, low sample size (HDLSS) data, such as the phenotype prediction problem using genetic data in bioinformatics, DNN suffers from overfitting and high-variance gradients. In this paper, we propose a DNN model tailored for the HDLSS data, named Deep Neural Pursuit (DNP). DNP selects a subset of high dimensional features for the alleviation of overfitting and takes the average over multiple dropouts to calculate gradients with low variance. As the first DNN method applied on the HDLSS data, DNP enjoys the advantages of the high nonlinearity, the robustness to high dimensionality, the capability of learning from a small number of samples, the stability in feature selection, and the end-to-end training. We demonstrate these advantages of DNP via empirical results on both synthetic and real-world biological datasets.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/318	Bo Liu, Ying Wei, Yu Zhang, Qiang Yang
Regional Concept Drift Detection and Density Synchronized Drift Adaptation	In data stream mining, the emergence of new patterns or a pattern ceasing to exist is called concept drift. Concept drift makes the learning process complicated because of the inconsistency between existing data and upcoming data. Since concept drift was first proposed, numerous articles have been published to address this issue in terms of distribution analysis. However, most distribution-based drift detection methods assume that a drift happens at an exact time point, and the data arrived before that time point is considered not important. Thus, if a drift only occurs in a small region of the entire feature space, the other non-drifted regions may also be suspended, thereby reducing the learning efficiency of models. To retrieve non-drifted information from suspended historical data, we propose a local drift degree (LDD) measurement that can continuously monitor regional density changes. Instead of suspending all historical data after a drift, we synchronize the regional density discrepancies according to LDD. Experimental evaluations on three public data sets show that our concept drift adaptation algorithm improves accuracy compared to other methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/317	Anjin Liu, Yiliao Song, Guangquan Zhang, Jie Lu
Hybrid Neural Networks for Learning the Trend in Time Series	The trend of time series characterizes the intermediate upward and downward behaviour of time series. Learning and forecasting the trend in time series data play an important role in many real applications, ranging from resource allocation in data centers, load schedule in smart grid, and so on. Inspired by the recent successes of neural networks, in this paper we propose TreNet, a novel end-to-end hybrid neural network to learn local and global contextual features for predicting the trend of time series. TreNet leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract salient features from local raw data of time series. Meanwhile, considering the long-range dependency existing in the sequence of historical trends of time series, TreNet uses a long-short term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM) to capture such dependency. Then, a feature fusion layer is to learn joint representation for predicting the trend. TreNet demonstrates its effectiveness by outperforming CNN, LSTM, the cascade of CNN and LSTM, Hidden Markov Model based method and various kernel based baselines on real datasets.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/316	Tao Lin, Tian Guo, Karl Aberer
Discriminative Deep Hashing for Scalable Face Image Retrieval	With the explosive growth of images containing faces, scalable face image retrieval has attracted increasing attention. Due to the amazing effectiveness, deep hashing has become a popular hashing method recently. In this work, we propose a new Discriminative Deep Hashing (DDH) network to learn discriminative and compact hash codes for large-scale face image retrieval. The proposed network incorporates the end-to-end learning, the divide-and-encode module and the desired discrete code learning into a unified framework. Specifically, a network with a stack of convolution-pooling layers is proposed to extract multi-scale and robust features by merging the outputs of the third max pooling layer and the fourth convolutional layer. To reduce the redundancy among hash codes and the network parameters simultaneously, a divide-and-encode module to generate compact hash codes. Moreover, a loss function is introduced to minimize the prediction errors of the learned hash codes, which can lead to discriminative hash codes. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared with some state-of-the-art hashing methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/315	Jie Lin, Zechao Li, Jinhui Tang
LoCaTe: Influence Quantification for Location Promotion in Location-based Social Networks	Location-based social networks (LBSNs) such as Foursquare offer a platform for users to share and be aware of each other's physical movements. As a result of such a sharing of check-in information with each other, users can be influenced to visit (or check-in) at the locations visited by their friends. Quantifying such influences in these LBSNs is useful in various settings such as location promotion, personalized recommendations, mobility pattern prediction etc. In this paper, we focus on the problem of location promotion and develop a model to quantify the influence specific to a location between a pair of users. Specifically, we develop a joint model called LoCaTe, consisting of (i) user mobility model estimated using kernel density estimates; (ii) a model of the semantics of the location using topic models; and (iii) a model of time-gap between check-ins using exponential distribution. We validate our model on a long-term crawl of Foursquare data collected between Jan 2015 Feb 2016, as well as on publicly available LBSN datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that LoCaTe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models for the same task.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/314	Ankita Likhyani, Srikanta Bedathur, Deepak P
Incomplete Attribute Learning with auxiliary labels	Visual attribute learning is a fundamental and challenging problem for image understanding. Considering the huge semantic space of attributes, it is economically impossible to annotate all their presence or absence for a natural image via crowd-sourcing. In this paper, we tackle the incompleteness nature of visual attributes by introducing auxiliary labels into a novel transductive learning framework. By jointly predicting the attributes from the input images and modeling the relationship of attributes and auxiliary labels, the missing attributes can be recovered effectively. In addition, the proposed model can be solved efficiently in an alternative way by optimizing quadratic programming problems and updating parameters in closed-form solutions. Moreover, we propose and investigate different methods for acquiring auxiliary labels. We conduct experiments on three widely used attribute prediction datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve the state-of-the-art performance with access to partially observed attribute annotations.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/313	Kongming Liang, Yuhong Guo, Hong Chang, Xilin Chen
Integrating Specialized Classifiers Based on Continuous Time Markov Chain	Specialized classifiers, namely those dedicated to a subset of classes, are often adopted in real-world recognition systems. However, integrating such classifiers is nontrivial. Existing methods, e.g. weighted average, usually implicitly assume that all constituents of an ensemble cover the same set of classes. Such methods can produce misleading predictions when used to combine specialized classifiers. This work explores a novel approach. Instead of combining predictions from individual classifiers directly, it first decomposes the predictions into sets of pairwise preferences, treating them as transition channels between classes, and thereon constructs a continuous-time Markov chain, and use the equilibrium distribution of this chain as the final prediction. This way allows us to form a coherent picture over all specialized predictions. On large public datasets, the proposed method obtains considerable improvement compared to mainstream ensemble methods, especially when the classifier coverage is highly unbalanced.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/312	Zhizhong Li, Dahua Lin
End-to-End Adversarial Memory Network for Cross-domain Sentiment Classification	Domain adaptation tasks such as cross-domain sentiment classification have raised much attention in recent years. Due to the domain discrepancy, a sentiment classifier trained in a source domain may not work well when directly applied to a target domain. Traditional methods need to manually select pivots, which behave in the same way for discriminative learning in both domains. Recently, deep learning methods have been proposed to learn a representation shared by domains. However, they lack the interpretability to directly identify the pivots. To address the problem, we introduce an end-to-end Adversarial Memory Network (AMN) for cross-domain sentiment classification. Unlike existing methods, our approach can automatically capture the pivots using an attention mechanism. Our framework consists of two parameter-shared memory networks: one is for sentiment classification and the other is for domain classification. The two networks are jointly trained so that the selected features minimize the sentiment classification error and at the same time make the domain classifier indiscriminative between the representations from the source or target domains. Moreover, unlike deep learning methods that cannot tell us which words are the pivots, our approach can offer a direct visualization of them. Experiments on the Amazon review dataset demonstrate that our approach can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/311	Zheng Li, Yu Zhang, Ying Wei, Yuxiang Wu, Qiang Yang
Demystifying Neural Style Transfer	Neural Style Transfer has recently demonstrated very exciting results which catches eyes in both academia and industry. Despite the amazing results, the principle of neural style transfer, especially why the Gram matrices could represent style remains unclear. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretation of neural style transfer by treating it as a domain adaptation problem. Specifically, we theoretically show that matching the Gram matrices of feature maps is equivalent to minimize the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) with the second order polynomial kernel. Thus, we argue that the essence of neural style transfer is to match the feature distributions between the style images and the generated images. To further support our standpoint, we experiment with several other distribution alignment methods, and achieve appealing results. We believe this novel interpretation connects these two important research fields, and could enlighten future researches.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/310	Yanghao Li, Naiyan Wang, Jiaying Liu, Xiaodi Hou
CFNN: Correlation Filter Neural Network for Visual Object Tracking	Albeit convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown promising capacity in many computer vision tasks, applying it to visual tracking is yet far from solved. Existing methods either employ a large external dataset to undertake exhaustive pre-training or suffer from less satisfactory results in terms of accuracy and robustness. To track single target in a wide range of videos, we present a novel Correlation Filter Neural Network architecture, as well as a complete visual tracking pipeline, The proposed approach is a special case of CNN, whose initialization does not need any pre-training on the external dataset. The initialization of network enjoys the merits of cyclic sampling to achieve the appealing discriminative capability, while the network updating scheme adopts advantages from back-propagation in order to capture new appearance variations. The tracking pipeline integrates both aspects well by making them complementary to each other. We validate our tracker on OTB-2013 benchmark. The proposed tracker obtains the promising results compared to most of existing representative trackers.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/309	Yang Li, Zhan Xu, Jianke Zhu
Classification and Representation Joint Learning via Deep Networks	Deep learning has been proven to be effective for classification problems. However, the majority of previous works trained classifiers by considering only class label information and ignoring the local information from the spatial distribution of training samples. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework that considers both class label information and local spatial distribution information between training samples. A two-channel network with shared weights is used to measure the local distribution. The classification performance can be improved with more detailed information provided by the local distribution, particularly when the training samples are insufficient. Additionally, the class label information can help to learn better feature representations compared with other feature learning methods that use only local distribution information between samples. The local distribution constraint between sample pairs can also be viewed as a regularization of the network, which can efficiently prevent the overfitting problem. Extensive experiments are conducted on several benchmark image classification datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/308	Ya Li, Xinmei Tian, Xu Shen, Dacheng Tao
MAM-RNN: Multi-level Attention Model Based RNN for Video Captioning	Visual information is quite important for the task of video captioning. However, in the video, there are a lot of uncorrelated content, which may cause interference to generate a correct caption. Based on this point, we attempt to exploit the visual features which are most correlated to the caption. In this paper, a Multi-level Attention Model based Recurrent Neural Network (MAM-RNN) is proposed, where MAM is utilized to encode the visual feature and RNN works as the decoder to generate the video caption. During generation, the proposed approach is able to adaptively attend to the salient regions in the frame and the frames correlated to the caption. Practically, the experimental results on two benchmark datasets, i.e., MSVD and Charades, have shown the excellent performance of the proposed approach.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/307	Xuelong Li, Bin Zhao, Xiaoqiang Lu
Locality Adaptive Discriminant Analysis	Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a popular technique for supervised dimensionality reduction, and its performance is satisfying when dealing with Gaussian distributed data. However, the neglect of local data structure makes LDA inapplicable to many real-world situations. So some works focus on the discriminant analysis between neighbor points, which can be easily affected by the noise in the original data space. In this paper, we propose a new supervised dimensionality reduction method, Locality Adaptive Discriminant Analysis (LADA), to lean a representative subspace of the data. Compared to LDA and its variants, the proposed method has three salient advantages: (1) it finds the principle projection directions without imposing any assumption on the data distribution; (2) it's able to exploit the local manifold structure of data in the desired subspace; (3) it exploits the points' neighbor relationship automatically without introducing any additional parameter to be tuned. Performance on synthetic datasets and real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/306	Xuelong Li, Mulin Chen, Feiping Nie, Qi Wang
Person Re-Identification by Deep Joint Learning of Multi-Loss Classification	Existing person re-identification (re-id) methods rely mostly on either localised or global feature representation. This ignores their joint benefit and mutual complementary effects. In this work, we show the advantages of jointly learning local and global features in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) by aiming to discover correlated local and global features in different context. Specifically, we formulate a method for joint learning of local and global feature selection losses designed to optimise person re-id when using generic matching metrics such as the L2 distance. We design a novel CNN architecture for Jointly Learning Multi-Loss (JLML) of local and global discriminative feature optimisation subject concurrently to the same re-id labelled information. Extensive comparative evaluations demonstrate the advantages of this new JLML model for person re-id over a wide range of state-of-the-art re-id methods on five benchmarks (VIPeR, GRID, CUHK01, CUHK03, Market-1501).	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/305	Wei Li, Xiatian Zhu, Shaogang Gong
Self-paced Compensatory Deep Boltzmann Machine for Semi-Structured Document Embedding	In the last decade, there has been a huge amount of documents with different types of rich metadata information, which belongs to the Semi-Structured Documents (SSDs), appearing in many real applications. It is an interesting research work to model this type of text data following the way how humans understand text with informative metadata. In the paper, we introduce a Self-paced Compensatory Deep Boltzmann Machine (SCDBM) architecture that learns a deep neural network by using metadata information to learn deep structure layer-wisely for Semi-Structured Documents (SSDs) embedding in a self-paced way. Inspired by the way how humans understand text, the model defines a deep process of document vector extraction beyond the space of words by jointing the metadata where each layer selects different types of metadata. We present efficient learning and inference algorithms for the SCDBM model and empirically demonstrate that using the representation discovered by this model has better performance on semi-structured document classification and retrieval, and tag prediction comparing with state-of-the-art baselines.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/304	Shuangyin Li, Rong Pan, Jun Yan
Online Robust Low-Rank Tensor Learning	The rapid increase of multidimensional data (a.k.a. tensor) like videos brings new challenges for low-rank data modeling approaches such as dynamic data size, complex high-order relations, and multiplicity of low-rank structures. Resolving these challenges require a new tensor analysis method that can perform tensor data analysis online, which however is still absent. In this paper, we propose an Online Robust Low-rank Tensor Modeling (ORLTM) approach to address these challenges. ORLTM dynamically explores the high-order correlations across all tensor modes for low-rank structure modeling. To analyze mixture data from multiple subspaces, ORLTM introduces a new dictionary learning component. ORLTM processes data streamingly and thus requires quite low memory cost that is independent of data size. This makes ORLTM quite suitable for processing large-scale tensor data. Empirical studies have validated the effectiveness of the proposed method on both synthetic data and one practical task, i.e., video background subtraction. In addition, we provide theoretical analysis regarding computational complexity and memory cost, demonstrating the efficiency of ORLTM rigorously.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/303	Ping Li, Jiashi Feng, Xiaojie Jin, Luming Zhang, Xianghua Xu, Shuicheng Yan
Affinity Learning for Mixed Data Clustering	In this paper, we propose a novel affinity learning based framework for mixed data clustering, which includes: how to process data with mixed-type attributes, how to learn affinities between data points, and how to exploit the learned affinities for clustering. In the proposed framework, each original data attribute is represented with several abstract objects defined according to the specific data type and values. Each attribute value is transformed into the initial affinities between the data point and the abstract objects of attribute. We refine these affinities and infer the unknown affinities between data points by taking into account the interconnections among the attribute values of all data points. The inferred affinities between data points can be exploited for clustering. Alternatively, the refined affinities between data points and the abstract objects of attributes can be transformed into new data features for clustering. Experimental results on many real world data sets demonstrate that the proposed framework is effective for mixed data clustering.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/302	Nan Li, Longin Jan Latecki
Multi-Stream Deep Similarity Learning Networks for Visual Tracking	Visual tracking has achieved remarkable success in recent decades, but it remains a challenging problem due to appearance variations over time and complex cluttered background. In this paper, we adopt a tracking-by-verification scheme to overcome these challenges by determining the patch in the subsequent frame that is most similar to the target template and distinctive to the background context. A multi-stream deep similarity learning network is proposed to learn the similarity comparison model. The loss function of our network encourages the distance between a positive patch in the search region and the target template to be smaller than that between positive patch and the background patches. Within the learned feature space, even if the distance between positive patches becomes large caused by the appearance change or interference of background clutter, our method can use the relative distance to distinguish the target robustly. Besides, the learned model is directly used for tracking with no need of model updating, parameter fine-tuning and can run at 45 fps on a single GPU. Our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on the visual tracking benchmark compared with other recent real-time-speed trackers, and shows better capability in handling background clutter, occlusion and appearance change.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/301	Kunpeng Li, Yu Kong, Yun Fu
Reconstruction-based Unsupervised Feature Selection: An Embedded Approach	Feature selection has been proven to be effective and efficient in preparing high-dimensional data for data mining and machine learning problems. Since real-world data is usually unlabeled, unsupervised feature selection has received increasing attention in recent years. Without label information, unsupervised feature selection needs alternative criteria to define feature relevance. Recently, data reconstruction error emerged as a new criterion for unsupervised feature selection, which defines feature relevance as the capability of features to approximate original data via a reconstruction function. Most existing algorithms in this family assume predefined, linear reconstruction functions. However, the reconstruction function should be data dependent and may not always be linear especially when the original data is high-dimensional. In this paper, we investigate how to learn the reconstruction function from the data automatically for unsupervised feature selection, and propose a novel reconstruction-based unsupervised feature selection framework REFS, which embeds the reconstruction function learning process into feature selection. Experiments on various types of real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework REFS.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/300	Jundong Li, Jiliang Tang, Huan Liu
Radar: Residual Analysis for Anomaly Detection in Attributed Networks	Attributed networks are pervasive in different domains, ranging from social networks, gene regulatory networks to financial transaction networks. This kind of rich network representation presents challenges for anomaly detection due to the heterogeneity of two data representations. A vast majority of existing algorithms assume certain properties of anomalies are given a prior. Since various types of anomalies in real-world attributed networks co-exist, the assumption that priori knowledge regarding anomalies is available does not hold. In this paper, we investigate the problem of anomaly detection in attributed networks generally from a residual analysis perspective, which has been shown to be effective in traditional anomaly detection problems. However, it is a non-trivial task in attributed networks as interactions among instances complicate the residual modeling process. Methodologically, we propose a learning framework to characterize the residuals of attribute information and its coherence with network information for anomaly detection. By learning and analyzing the residuals, we detect anomalies whose behaviors are singularly different from the majority. Experiments on real datasets show the effectiveness and generality of the proposed framework.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/299	Jundong Li, Harsh Dani, Xia Hu, Huan Liu
Projective Low-rank Subspace Clustering via Learning Deep Encoder	Low-rank subspace clustering (LRSC) has been considered as the state-of-the-art method on small datasets. LRSC constructs a desired similarity graph by low-rank representation (LRR), and employs a spectral clustering to segment the data samples. However, effectively applying LRSC into clustering big data becomes a challenge because both LRR and spectral clustering suffer from high computational cost. To address this challenge, we create a projective low-rank subspace clustering (PLrSC) scheme for large scale clustering problem. First, a small dataset is randomly sampled from big dataset. Second, our proposed predictive low-rank decomposition (PLD) is applied to train a deep encoder by using the small dataset, and the deep encoder is used to fast compute the low-rank representations of all data samples. Third, fast spectral clustering is employed to segment the representations. As a non-trivial contribution, we theoretically prove the deep encoder can universally approximate to the exact (or bounded) recovery of the row space. Experiments verify that our scheme outperforms the related methods on large scale datasets in a small amount of time. We achieve the state-of-art clustering accuracy by 95.8% on MNIST using scattering convolution features.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/298	Jun Li, Liu Hongfu, Handong Zhao, Yun Fu
Large-scale Subspace Clustering by Fast Regression Coding	Large-Scale Subspace Clustering (LSSC) is an interesting and important problem in big data era. However, most existing methods (i.e., sparse or low-rank subspace clustering) cannot be directly used for solving LSSC because they suffer from the high time complexity-quadratic or cubic in n (the number of data points). To overcome this limitation, we propose a Fast Regression Coding (FRC) to optimize regression codes, and simultaneously train a non-linear function to approximate the codes. By using FRC, we develop an efficient Regression Coding Clustering (RCC) framework to solve the LSSC problem. It consists of sampling, FRC and clustering. RCC randomly samples a small number of data points, quickly calculates the codes of all data points by using the non-linear function learned from FRC, and employs a large-scale spectral clustering method to cluster the codes. Besides, we provide a theorem guarantee that the non-linear function has a first-order approximation ability and a group effect. The theorem manifests that the codes are easily used to construct a dividable similarity graph. Compared with the state-of-the-art LSSC methods, our model achieves better clustering results in large-scale datasets.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/297	Jun Li, Handong Zhao, Zhiqiang Tao, Yun Fu
Improving the Generalization Performance of Multi-class SVM via Angular Regularization	In multi-class support vector machine (MSVM) for classification, one core issue is to regularize the coefficient vectors to reduce overfitting. Various regularizers have been proposed such as L2, L1, and trace norm. In this paper, we introduce a new type of regularization approach -- angular regularization, that encourages the coefficient vectors to have larger angles such that class regions can be widen to flexibly accommodate unseen samples. We propose a novel angular regularizer based on the singular values of the coefficient matrix, where the uniformity of singular values reduces the correlation among different classes and drives the angles between coefficient vectors to increase. In generalization error analysis, we show that decreasing this regularizer effectively reduces generalization error bound. On various datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of the regularizer in reducing overfitting.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/296	Jianxin Li, Haoyi Zhou, Pengtao Xie, Yingchun Zhang
Efficient Kernel Selection via Spectral Analysis	Kernel selection is a fundamental problem of kernel methods. Existing measures for kernel selection either provide less theoretical guarantee or have high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel kernel selection criterion based on a newly defined spectral measure of a kernel matrix, with sound theoretical foundation and high computational efficiency. We first show that the spectral measure can be used to derive generalization bounds for some kernel-based algorithms. By minimizing the derived generalization bounds, we propose the kernel selection criterion with spectral measure. Moreover, we demonstrate that the popular minimum graph cut and maximum mean discrepancy are two special cases of the proposed criterion. Experimental results on lots of data sets show that our proposed criterion can not only give the comparable results as the state-of-the-art criterion, but also significantly improve the efficiency.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/295	Jian Li, Yong Liu, Hailun  Lin, Yinliang Yue, Weiping Wang
Learning User's Intrinsic and Extrinsic Interests for Point-of-Interest Recommendation: A Unified Approach	Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has been an important service on location-based social networks. However, it is very challenging to generate accurate recommendations due to the complex nature of user's interest in POI and the data sparseness. In this paper, we propose a novel unified approach that could effectively learn fine-grained and interpretable user's interest, and adaptively model the missing data. Specifically, a user's general interest in POI is modeled as a mixture of her intrinsic and extrinsic interests, upon which we formulate the ranking constraints in our unified recommendation approach. Furthermore, a self-adaptive location-oriented method is proposed to capture the inherent property of missing data, which is formulated as squared error based loss in our unified optimization objective. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of our approach.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/294	Huayu Li, Yong Ge, Defu Lian, Hao Liu
Self-paced Convolutional Neural Networks	Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved breakthrough performance in many pattern recognition tasks. In order to distinguish the reliable data from the noisy and confusing data, we improve CNNs with self-paced learning (SPL) for enhancing the learning robustness of CNNs. In the proposed self-paced convolutional network (SPCN), each sample is assigned to a weight to reflect the easiness of the sample. Then a dynamic self-paced function is incorporated into the leaning objective of CNN to jointly learn the parameters of CNN and the latent weight variable. SPCN learns the samples from easy to complex and the sample weights can dynamically control the learning rates for converging to better values. To gain more insights of SPCN, theoretical studies are conducted to show that SPCN converges to a stationary solution and is robust to the noisy and confusing data. Experimental results on MNIST and rectangles datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/293	Hao Li, Maoguo Gong
Effective Representing of Information Network by Variational Autoencoder	Network representation is the basis of many applications and of extensive interest in various fields, such as information retrieval, social network analysis, and recommendation systems. Most previous methods for network representation only consider the incomplete aspects of a problem, including link structure, node information, and partial integration. The present study proposes a deep network representation model that seamlessly integrates the text information and structure of a network. Our model captures highly non-linear relationships between nodes and complex features of a network by exploiting the variational autoencoder (VAE), which is a deep unsupervised generation algorithm. We also merge the representation learned with a paragraph vector model and that learned with the VAE to obtain the network representation that preserves both structure and text information. We conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on benchmark datasets and find our model performs better than state-of-the-art techniques by a large margin.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/292	Hang Li, Haozheng Wang, Zhenglu Yang, Haochen Liu
High Dimensional Bayesian Optimization using Dropout	"Scaling Bayesian optimization to high dimensions is challenging task as the global optimization of high-dimensional acquisition function can be expensive and often infeasible. Existing methods depend either on limited ""active"" variables or the additive form of the objective function. We propose a new method for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization, that uses a drop-out strategy to optimize only a subset of variables at each iteration. We derive theoretical bounds for the regret and show how it can inform the derivation of our algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms for optimization on two benchmark functions and two real-world applications - training cascade classifiers and optimizing alloy composition."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/291	Cheng Li, Sunil Gupta, Santu Rana, Vu Nguyen, Svetha Venkatesh, Alistair Shilton
Constrained Bayesian Reinforcement Learning via Approximate Linear Programming	In this paper, we consider the safe learning scenario where we need to restrict the exploratory behavior of a reinforcement learning agent. Specifically, we treat the problem as a form of Bayesian reinforcement learning in an environment that is modeled as a constrained MDP (CMDP) where the cost function penalizes undesirable situations. We propose a model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning (BRL) algorithm for such an environment, eliciting risk-sensitive exploration in a principled way. Our algorithm efficiently solves the constrained BRL problem by approximate linear programming, and generates a finite state controller in an off-line manner. We provide theoretical guarantees and demonstrate empirically that our approach outperforms the state of the art.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/290	Jongmin Lee, Youngsoo Jang, Pascal Poupart, Kee-Eung Kim
Name Nationality Classification with Recurrent Neural Networks	Personal names tend to have many variations differing from country to country. Though there exists a large amount of personal names on the Web, nationality prediction solely based on names has not been fully studied due to its difficulties in extracting subtle character level features. We propose a recurrent neural network based model which predicts nationalities of each name using automatic feature extraction. Evaluation of Olympic record data shows that our model achieves greater accuracy than previous feature based approaches in nationality prediction tasks. We also evaluate our proposed model and baseline models on name ethnicity classification task, again achieving better or comparable performances. We further investigate the effectiveness of character embeddings used in our proposed model.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/289	Jinhyuk Lee, Hyunjae Kim, Miyoung Ko, Donghee Choi, Jaehoon Choi, Jaewoo Kang
Semantic Visualization for Short Texts with Word Embeddings	Semantic visualization integrates topic modeling and visualization, such that every document is associated with a topic distribution as well as visualization coordinates on a low-dimensional Euclidean space. We address the problem of semantic visualization for short texts. Such documents are increasingly common, including tweets, search snippets, news headlines, or status updates. Due to their short lengths, it is difficult to model semantics as the word co-occurrences in such a corpus are very sparse. Our approach is to incorporate auxiliary information, such as word embeddings from a larger corpus, to supplement the lack of co-occurrences. This requires the development of a novel semantic visualization model that seamlessly integrates visualization coordinates, topic distributions, and word vectors. We propose a model called GaussianSV, which outperforms pipelined baselines that derive topic models and visualization coordinates as disjoint steps, as well as semantic visualization baselines that do not consider word embeddings.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/288	Tuan M.

Learning Sparse Representations in Reinforcement Learning with Sparse Coding	A variety of representation learning approaches have been investigated for reinforcement learning; much less attention, however, has been given to investigating the utility of sparse coding. Outside of reinforcement learning, sparse coding representations have been widely used, with non-convex objectives that result in discriminative representations. In this work, we develop a supervised sparse coding objective for policy evaluation. Despite the non-convexity of this objective, we prove that all local minima are global minima, making the approach amenable to simple optimization strategies. We empirically show that it is key to use a supervised objective, rather than the more straightforward unsupervised sparse coding approach. We then compare the learned representations to a canonical fixed sparse representation, called tile-coding, demonstrating that the sparse coding representation outperforms a wide variety of tile-coding representations.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/287	Lei Le, Raksha Kumaraswamy, Martha White
Basket-Sensitive Personalized Item Recommendation	Personalized item recommendation is useful in narrowing down the list of options provided to a user. In this paper, we address the problem scenario where the user is currently holding a basket of items, and the task is to recommend an item to be added to the basket. Here, we assume that items currently in a basket share some association based on an underlying latent need, e.g., ingredients to prepare some dish, spare parts of some device. Thus, it is important that a recommended item is relevant not only to the user, but also to the existing items in the basket. Towards this goal, we propose two approaches. First, we explore a factorization-based model called BFM that incorporates various types of associations involving the user, the target item to be recommended, and the items currently in the basket. Second, based on our observation that various recommendations towards constructing the same basket should have similar likelihoods, we propose another model called CBFM that further incorporates basket-level constraints. Experiments on three real-life datasets from different domains empirically validate these models against baselines based on matrix factorization and association rules.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/286	Duc-Trong Le, Hady W.

Saliency Guided End-to-End Learning for Weakly Supervised Object Detection	Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD), which is the problem of learning detectors using only image-level labels, has been attracting more and more interest. However, this problem is quite challenging due to the lack of location supervision. To address this issue, this paper integrates saliency into a deep architecture, in which the location information is explored both explicitly and implicitly. Specifically, we select highly confident object proposals under the guidance of class-specific saliency maps. The location information, together with semantic and saliency information, of the select proposals are then used to explicitly supervise the network by imposing two additional losses. Meanwhile, a saliency prediction sub-network is built in the architecture. The prediction results are used to implicitly guide the localization procedure. The entire network is trained end-to-end. Experiments on PASCAL VOC demonstrate that our approach outperforms all state-of-the-arts.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/285	Baisheng Lai, Xiaojin Gong
Earth Mover's Distance Pooling over Siamese LSTMs for Automatic Short Answer Grading	"Automatic short answer grading (ASAG) can reduce tedium for instructors, but is complicated by free-form student inputs. An important ASAG task is to assign ordinal scores to student answers, given some ""model"" or ideal answers. Here we introduce a novel framework for ASAG by cascading three neural building blocks: Siamese bidirectional LSTMs applied to a model and a student answer, a novel pooling layer based on earth-mover distance (EMD) across all hidden states from both LSTMs, and a flexible final regression layer to output scores. On standard ASAG data sets, our system shows substantial reduction in grade estimation error compared to competitive baselines. We demonstrate that EMD pooling results in substantial accuracy gains, and that a support vector ordinal regression (SVOR) output layer helps outperform softmax. Our system also outperforms recent attention mechanisms on LSTM states."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/284	Sachin Kumar, Soumen Chakrabarti, Shourya Roy
Learning Latest Classifiers without Additional Labeled Data	In various applications such as spam mail classification, the performance of classifiers deteriorates over time. Although retraining classifiers using labeled data helps to maintain the performance, continuously preparing labeled data is quite expensive. In this paper, we propose a method to learn classifiers by using newly obtained unlabeled data, which are easy to prepare, as well as labeled data collected beforehand. A major reason for the performance deterioration is the emergence of new features that do not appear in the training phase. Another major reason is the change of the distribution between the training and test phases. The proposed method learns the latest classifiers that overcome both problems. With the proposed method, the conditional distribution of new features given existing features is learned using the unlabeled data. In addition, the proposed method estimates the density ratio between training and test distributions by using the labeled and unlabeled data. We approximate the classification error of a classifier, which exploits new features as well as existing features, at the test phase by incorporating both the conditional distribution of new features and the densityratio, simultaneously. By minimizing the approximated error while integrating out new feature values, we obtain a classifier that exploits new features and fits on the test phase. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with experiments using synthetic and real-world data sets.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/283	Atsutoshi Kumagai, Tomoharu Iwata
Decreasing Uncertainty in Planning with State Prediction	In real world environments the state is almost never completely known. Exploration is often expensive. The application of planning in these environments is consequently more difficult and less robust. In this paper we present an approach for predicting new information about a partially-known state. The state is translated into a partially-known multigraph, which can then be extended using machine-learning techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it enhances the scalability of our planners, and leads to less time spent on sensing actions.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/282	Senka Krivic, Michael Cashmore, Daniele Magazzeni, Bram Ridder, Sandor Szedmak, Justus Piater
Efficiency Through Procrastination: Approximately Optimal Algorithm Configuration with Runtime Guarantees	Algorithm configuration methods have achieved much practical success, but to date have not been backed by meaningful performance guarantees. We address this gap with a new algorithm configuration framework, Structured Procrastination. With high probability and nearly as quickly as possible in the worst case, our framework finds an algorithm configuration that provably achieves near optimal performance. Moreover, its running time requirements asymptotically dominate those of existing methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/281	Robert Kleinberg, Kevin Leyton-Brown, Brendan Lucier
DeepStory: Video Story QA by Deep Embedded Memory Networks	Question-answering (QA) on video contents is a significant challenge for achieving human-level intelligence as it involves both vision and language in real-world settings. Here we demonstrate the possibility of an AI agent performing video story QA by learning from a large amount of cartoon videos. We develop a video-story learning model, i.e. Deep Embedded Memory Networks (DEMN), to reconstruct stories from a joint scene-dialogue video stream using a latent embedding space of observed data. The video stories are stored in a long-term memory component. For a given question, an LSTM-based attention model uses the long-term memory to recall the best question-story-answer triplet by focusing on specific words containing key information. We trained the DEMN on a novel QA dataset of children's cartoon video series, Pororo. The dataset contains 16,066 scene-dialogue pairs of 20.5-hour videos, 27,328 fine-grained sentences for scene description, and 8,913 story-related QA pairs. Our experimental results show that the DEMN outperforms other QA models. This is mainly due to 1) the reconstruction of video stories in a scene-dialogue combined form that utilize the latent embedding and 2) attention. DEMN also achieved state-of-the-art results on the MovieQA benchmark.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/280	Kyung-Min Kim, Min-Oh Heo, Seong-Ho Choi, Byoung-Tak Zhang
Learning deep structured network for weakly supervised change detection	Conventional change detection methods require a large number of images to learn background models or depend on tedious pixel-level labeling by humans. In this paper, we present a weakly supervised approach that needs only image-level labels to simultaneously detect and localize changes in a pair of images. To this end, we employ a deep neural network with DAG topology to learn patterns of change from image-level labeled training data. On top of the initial CNN activations, we define a CRF model to incorporate the local differences and context with the dense connections between individual pixels. We apply a constrained mean-field algorithm to estimate the pixel-level labels, and use the estimated labels to update the parameters of the CNN in an iterative EM framework. This enables imposing global constraints on the observed foreground probability mass function. Our evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate superior detection and localization performance.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/279	Salman Khan, Xuming He, Fatih Porikli, Mohammed Bennamoun, Ferdous Sohel, Roberto Togneri
Bernoulli Rank-1 Bandits for Click Feedback	"The probability that a user will click a search result depends both on its relevance and its position on the results page. The position based model explains this behavior by ascribing to every item an attraction probability, and to every position an examination probability. To be clicked, a result must be both attractive and examined. The probabilities of an item-position pair being clicked thus form the entries of a rank-1 matrix. We propose the learning problem of a Bernoulli rank-1 bandit where at each step, the learning agent chooses a pair of row and column arms, and receives the product of their Bernoulli-distributed values as a reward. This is a special case of the stochastic rank-1 bandit problem considered in recent work that proposed an elimination based algorithm Rank1Elim, and showed that Rank1Elim's regret scales linearly with the number of rows and columns on ""benign"" instances. These are the instances where the minimum of the average row and column rewards mu is bounded away from zero. The issue with Rank1Elim is that it fails to be competitive with straightforward bandit strategies as mu tends to 0. In this paper we propose Rank1ElimKL, which replaces the crude confidence intervals of Rank1Elim with confidence intervals based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences. With the help of a novel result concerning the scaling of KL divergences we prove that with this change, our algorithm will be competitive no matter the value of mu. Experiments with synthetic data confirm that on benign instances the performance of Rank1ElimKL is significantly better than that of even Rank1Elim. Similarly, experiments with models derived from real-data confirm that the improvements are significant across the board, regardless of whether the data is benign or not."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/278	Sumeet Katariya, Branislav Kveton, Csaba Szepesvári, Claire Vernade, Zheng Wen
Modelling the Working Week for Multi-Step Forecasting using Gaussian Process Regression	In time-series forecasting, regression is a popular method, with Gaussian Process Regression widely held to be the state of the art. The versatility of Gaussian Processes has led to them being used in many varied application domains. However, though many real-world applications involve data which follows a working-week structure, where weekends exhibit substantially different behavior to weekdays, methods for explicit modelling of working-week effects in Gaussian Process Regression models have not been proposed. Not explicitly modelling the working week fails to incorporate a significant source of information which can be invaluable in forecasting scenarios. In this work we provide novel kernel-combination methods to explicitly model working-week effects in time-series data for more accurate predictions using Gaussian Process Regression. Further, we demonstrate that prediction accuracy can be improved by constraining the non-convex optimization process of finding optimal hyperparameter values. We validate the effectiveness of our methods by performing multi-step prediction on two real-world publicly available time-series datasets - one relating to electricity Smart Meter data of the University of Melbourne, and the other relating to the counts of pedestrians in the City of Melbourne.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/277	Pasan Karunaratne, Masud Moshtaghi, Shanika Karunasekera, Aaron Harwood, Trevor Cohn
A Functional Dynamic Boltzmann Machine	Dynamic Boltzmann machines (DyBMs) are recently developed generative models of a time series. They are designed to learn a time series by efficient online learning algorithms, whilst taking long-term dependencies into account with help of eligibility traces, recursively updatable memory units storing descriptive statistics of all the past data. The current DyBMs assume a finite-dimensional time series and cannot be applied to a functional time series, in which the dimension goes to infinity (e.g., spatiotemporal data on a continuous space). In this paper, we present a functional dynamic Boltzmann machine (F-DyBM) as a generative model of a functional time series. A technical challenge is to devise an online learning algorithm with which F-DyBM, consisting of functions and integrals, can learn a functional time series using only finite observations of it. We rise to the above challenge by combining a kernel-based function approximation method along with a statistical interpolation method and finally derive closed-form update rules. We design numerical experiments to empirically confirm the effectiveness of our solutions. The experimental results demonstrate consistent error reductions as compared to baseline methods, from which we conclude the effectiveness of F-DyBM for functional time series prediction.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/276	Hiroshi Kajino
Confusion Graph: Detecting Confusion Communities in Large Scale Image Classification	"For deep CNN-based image classification models, we observe that confusions between classes with high visual similarity are much stronger than those where classes are visually dissimilar. With these unbalanced confusions, classes can be organized in communities, which is similar to cliques of people in the social network. Based on this, we propose a graph-based tool named ""confusion graph"" to quantify these confusions and further reveal the community structure inside the database. With this community structure, we can diagnose the model's weaknesses and improve the classification accuracy using specialized expert sub-nets, which is comparable to other state-of-the-art techniques. Utilizing this community information, we can also employ pre-trained models to automatically identify mislabeled images in the large scale database. With our method, researchers just need to manually check approximate 3% of the ILSVRC2012 classification database to locate almost all mislabeled samples."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/275	Ruochun Jin, Yong Dou, Yueqing Wang, Xin Niu
Improving Classification Accuracy of Feedforward Neural Networks for Spiking Neuromorphic Chips	Deep Neural Networks (DNN) achieve human level performance in many image analytics tasks but DNNs are mostly deployed to GPU platforms that consume a considerable amount of power. New hardware platforms using lower precision arithmetic achieve drastic reductions in power consumption. More recently, brain-inspired spiking neuromorphic chips have achieved even lower power consumption, on the order of milliwatts, while still offering real-time processing. However, for deploying DNNs to energy efficient neuromorphic chips the incompatibility between continuous neurons and synaptic weights of traditional DNNs, discrete spiking neurons and synapses of neuromorphic chips need to be overcome. Previous work has achieved this by training a network to learn continuous probabilities, before it is deployed to a neuromorphic architecture, such as IBM TrueNorth Neurosynaptic System, by random sampling these probabilities. The main contribution of this paper is a new learning algorithm that learns a TrueNorth configuration ready for deployment. We achieve this by training directly a binary hardware crossbar that accommodates the TrueNorth axon configuration constrains and we propose a different neuron model. Results of our approach trained on electroencephalogram (EEG) data show a significant improvement with previous work (76% vs 86% accuracy) while maintaining state of the art performance on the MNIST handwritten data set.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/274	Antonio Jimeno Yepes, Jianbin Tang, Benjamin Scott Mashford
Variational Deep Embedding: An Unsupervised and Generative Approach to Clustering	Clustering is among the most fundamental tasks in machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose Variational Deep Embedding (VaDE), a novel unsupervised generative clustering approach within the framework of Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). Specifically, VaDE models the data generative procedure with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a deep neural network (DNN): 1) the GMM picks a cluster; 2) from which a latent embedding is generated; 3) then the DNN decodes the latent embedding into an observable. Inference in VaDE is done in a variational way: a different DNN is used to encode observables to latent embeddings, so that the evidence lower bound (ELBO) can be optimized using the Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) estimator and the reparameterization trick. Quantitative comparisons with strong baselines are included in this paper, and experimental results show that VaDE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art clustering methods on 5 benchmarks from various modalities. Moreover, by VaDE's generative nature, we show its capability of generating highly realistic samples for any specified cluster, without using supervised information during training.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/273	Zhuxi Jiang, Yin Zheng, Huachun Tan, Bangsheng Tang, Hanning Zhou
Theoretic Analysis and Extremely Easy Algorithms for Domain Adaptive Feature Learning	Domain adaptation problems arise in a variety of applications, where a training dataset from the source domain and a test dataset from the target domain typically follow different distributions. The primary difficulty in designing effective learning models to solve such problems lies in how to bridge the gap between the source and target distributions. In this paper, we provide comprehensive analysis of feature learning algorithms used in conjunction with linear classifiers for domain adaptation. Our analysis shows that in order to achieve good adaptation performance, the second moments of the source domain distribution and target domain distribution should be similar. Based on our new analysis, a novel extremely easy feature learning algorithm for domain adaptation is proposed. Furthermore, our algorithm is extended by leveraging multiple layers, leading to another feature learning algorithm. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in terms of domain adaptation tasks on Amazon review and spam datasets from the ECML/PKDD 2006 discovery challenge.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/272	Wenhao Jiang, Cheng Deng, Wei Liu, Feiping Nie, Fu-lai Chung, Heng Huang
Exploration of Tree-based Hierarchical Softmax for Recurrent Language Models	Recently, variants of neural networks for computational linguistics have been proposed and successfully applied to neural language modeling and neural machine translation. These neural models can leverage knowledge from massive corpora but they are extremely slow as they predict candidate words from a large vocabulary during training and inference. As an alternative to gradient approximation and softmax with class decomposition, we explore the tree-based hierarchical softmax method and reform its architecture, making it compatible with modern GPUs and introducing a compact tree-based loss function. When combined with several word hierarchical clustering algorithms, improved performance is achieved in language modelling task with intrinsic evaluation criterions on PTB, WikiText-2 and WikiText-103 datasets.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/271	Nan Jiang, Wenge Rong, Min Gao, Yikang Shen, Zhang Xiong
Semi-supervised Learning over Heterogeneous Information Networks by Ensemble of Meta-graph Guided Random Walks	Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) is a general representation of many real world applications. The difference between HIN and traditional homogeneous graphs is that the nodes and edges in HIN are with types. Then in the many applications, we need to consider the types to make the approach more semantically meaningful. For the applications that annotation is expensive, on natural way is to consider semi-supervised learning over HIN. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised learning algorithm constrained by the types of HINs. We first decompose the original HIN into several semantically meaningful sub-graphs based the meta-graphs composed of entity and relation types. Then we perform random walk over the sub-graphs to propagate the labels from labeled data to unlabeled data. After we obtain all the labels propagated by different trials of random walk guided by meta-graphs, we use an ensemble algorithm to vote for the final labeling results. We use two public available datasets, 20-newsgroups and RCV1 datasets to test our algorithm. Experimental results show that our algorithm is better than the traditional semi-supervised learning algorithms for HINs. One particular by-product of this work is that we show that previous random walk approach guided by meta-paths can be non-stationary, which is the major reason we propose a meta-graph guide random walk for semi-supervised learning over HINs.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/270	He Jiang, Yangqiu Song, Chenguang Wang, Ming Zhang, Yizhou Sun
Embedding-based Representation of Categorical Data by Hierarchical Value Coupling Learning	Learning the representation of categorical data with hierarchical value coupling relationships is very challenging but critical for the effective analysis and learning of such data. This paper proposes a novel coupled unsupervised categorical data representation (CURE) framework and its instantiation, i.e., a coupled data embedding (CDE) method, for representing categorical data by hierarchical value-to-value cluster coupling learning. Unlike existing embedding- and similarity-based representation methods which can capture only a part or none of these complex couplings, CDE explicitly incorporates the hierarchical couplings into its embedding representation. CDE first learns two complementary feature value couplings which are then used to cluster values with different granularities. It further models the couplings in value clusters within the same granularity and with different granularities to embed feature values into a new numerical space with independent dimensions. Substantial experiments show that CDE significantly outperforms three popular unsupervised embedding methods and three state-of-the-art similarity-based representation methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/269	Songlei Jian, Longbing Cao, Guansong Pang, Kai Lu, Hang Gao
Privacy Issues Regarding the Application of DNNs to Activity-Recognition using Wearables and Its Countermeasures by Use of Adversarial Training	Deep neural networks have been successfully applied to activity recognition with wearables in terms of recognition performance. However, the black-box nature of neural networks could lead to privacy concerns. Namely, generally it is hard to expect what neural networks learn from data, and so they possibly learn features that highly discriminate user-information unintentionally, which increases the risk of information-disclosure. In this study, we analyzed the features learned by conventional deep neural networks when applied to data of wearables to confirm this phenomenon.Based on the results of our analysis, we propose the use of an adversarial training framework to suppress the risk of sensitive/unintended information disclosure. Our proposed model considers both an adversarial user classifier and a regular activity-classifier during training, which allows the model to learn representations that help the classifier to distinguish the activities but which, at the same time, prevents it from accessing user-discriminative information. This paper provides an empirical validation of the privacy issue and efficacy of the proposed method using three activity recognition tasks based on data of wearables. The empirical validation shows that our proposed method suppresses the concerns without any significant performance degradation, compared to conventional deep nets on all three tasks.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/268	Yusuke Iwasawa, Kotaro Nakayama, Ikuko Yairi, Yutaka Matsuo
Adaptive Learning Rate via Covariance Matrix Based Preconditioning for Deep Neural Networks	Adaptive learning rate algorithms such as RMSProp are widely used for training deep neural networks. RMSProp offers efficient training since it uses first order gradients to approximate Hessian-based preconditioning. However, since the first order gradients include noise caused by stochastic optimization, the approximation may be inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive learning rate algorithm called SDProp. Its key idea is effective handling of the noise by preconditioning based on covariance matrix. For various neural networks, our approach is more efficient and effective than RMSProp and its variant.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/267	Yasutoshi Ida, Yasuhiro Fujiwara, Sotetsu Iwamura
Ordinal Zero-Shot Learning	Zero-shot learning predicts new class even if no training data is available for that class. The solution to conventional zero-shot learning usually depends on side information such as attribute or text corpora. But these side information is not easy to obtain or use. Fortunately in many classification tasks, the class labels are ordered, and therefore closely related to each other. This paper deals with zero-shot learning for ordinal classification. The key idea is using label relevance to expand supervision information from seen labels to unseen labels. The proposed method SIDL generates a supervision intensity distribution (SID) that contains each label's supervision intensity, and then learns a mapping from instance to SID. Experiments on two typical ordinal classification problems, i.e., head pose estimation and age estimation, show that SIDL performs significantly better than the compared regression methods. Furthermore, SIDL appears much more robust against the increase of unseen labels than other compared baselines.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/266	Zengwei Huo, Xin Geng
Enhancing the Unified Features to Locate Buggy Files by Exploiting the Sequential Nature of Source Code	Bug reports provide an effective way for end-users to disclose potential bugs hidden in a software system, while automatically locating the potential buggy source files according to a bug report remains a great challenge in software maintenance. Many previous approaches represent bug reports and source code from lexical and structural information correlated their relevance by measuring their similarity, and recently a CNN-based model is proposed to learn the unified features for bug localization, which overcomes the difficulty in modeling natural and programming languages with different structural semantics. However, previous studies fail to capture the sequential nature of source code, which carries additional semantics beyond the lexical and structural terms and such information is vital in modeling program functionalities and behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel model LS-CNN, which enhances the unified features by exploiting the sequential nature of source code. LS-CNN combines CNN and LSTM to extract semantic features for automatically identifying potential buggy source code according to a bug report. Experimental results on widely-used software projects indicate that LS-CNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in locating buggy files.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/265	Xuan Huo, Ming Li
Incremental Matrix Factorization: A Linear Feature Transformation Perspective	Matrix Factorization (MF) is among the most widely used techniques for collaborative filtering based recommendation. Along this line, a critical demand is to incrementally refine the MF models when new ratings come in an online scenario. However, most of existing incremental MF algorithms are limited by specific MF models or strict use restrictions. In this paper, we propose a general incremental MF framework by designing a linear transformation of user and item latent vectors over time. This framework shows a relatively high accuracy with a computation and space efficient training process in an online scenario. Meanwhile, we explain the framework with a low-rank approximation perspective, and give an upper bound on the training error when this framework is used for incremental learning in some special cases. Finally, extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly validate the effectiveness, efficiency and storage performance of the proposed framework.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/264	Xunpeng Huang, Le Wu, Enhong Chen, Hengshu Zhu, Qi Liu, Yijun Wang
Cross-modal Common Representation Learning by Hybrid Transfer Network	DNN-based cross-modal retrieval is a research hotspot to retrieve across different modalities as image and text, but existing methods often face the challenge of insufficient cross-modal training data. In single-modal scenario, similar problem is usually relieved by transferring knowledge from large-scale auxiliary datasets (as ImageNet). Knowledge from such single-modal datasets is also very useful for cross-modal retrieval, which can provide rich general semantic information that can be shared across different modalities. However, it is challenging to transfer useful knowledge from single-modal (as image) source domain to cross-modal (as image/text) target domain. Knowledge in source domain cannot be directly transferred to both two different modalities in target domain, and the inherent cross-modal correlation contained in target domain provides key hints for cross-modal retrieval which should be preserved during transfer process. This paper proposes Cross-modal Hybrid Transfer Network (CHTN) with two subnetworks: Modal-sharing transfer subnetwork utilizes the modality in both source and target domains as a bridge, for transferring knowledge to both two modalities simultaneously; Layer-sharing correlation subnetwork preserves the inherent cross-modal semantic correlation to further adapt to cross-modal retrieval task. Cross-modal data can be converted to common representation by CHTN for retrieval, and comprehensive experiment on 3 datasets shows its effectiveness.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/263	Xin Huang, Yuxin Peng, Mingkuan Yuan
Multi-instance multi-label active learning	Multi-instance multi-label learning(MIML) has been successfully applied into many real-world applications. Along with the enhancing of the expressive power, the cost of labelling a MIML example increases significantly. And thus it becomes an important task to train an effective MIML model with as few labelled examples as possible. Active learning, which actively selects the most valuable data to query their labels, is a main approach to reducing labeling cost. Existing active methods achieved great success in traditional learning tasks, but cannot be directly applied to MIML problems. In this paper, we propose a MIML active learning algorithm, which exploits diversity and uncertainty in both the input and output space to query the most valuable information. This algorithm designs a novel query strategy for MIML objects specifically and acquires more precise information from the oracle without addition cost. Based on the queried information, the MIML model is then effectively trained by simultaneously optimizing the relative rank among instances and labels.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/262	Sheng-Jun Huang, Nengneng Gao, Songcan Chen
Cost-Effective Active Learning from Diverse Labelers	In traditional active learning, there is only one labeler that always returns the ground truth of queried labels. However, in many applications, multiple labelers are available to offer diverse qualities of labeling with different costs. In this paper, we perform active selection on both instances and labelers, aiming to improve the classification model most with the lowest cost. While the cost of a labeler is proportional to its overall labeling quality, we also observe that different labelers usually have diverse expertise, and thus it is likely that labelers with a low overall quality can provide accurate labels on some specific instances. Based on this fact, we propose a novel active selection criterion to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of instance-labeler pairs, which ensures that the selected instance is helpful for improving the classification model, and meanwhile the selected labeler can provide an accurate label for the instance with a relative low cost. Experiments on both UCI and real crowdsourcing data sets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach on selecting cost-effective queries.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/261	Sheng-Jun Huang, Jia-Lve Chen, Xin Mu, Zhi-Hua Zhou
Mention Recommendation for Twitter with End-to-end Memory Network	In this study, we investigated the problem of recommending usernames when people attempt to use the ``@'' sign to mention other people in twitter-like social media. With the extremely rapid development of social networking services, this problem has received considerable attention in recent years. Previous methods have studied the problem from different aspects. Because most of Twitter-like microblogging services limit the length of posts, statistical learning methods may be affected by the problems of word sparseness and synonyms. Although recent progress in neural word embedding methods have advanced the state-of-the-art in many natural language processing tasks, the benefits of word embedding have not been taken into consideration for this problem. In this work, we proposed a novel end-to-end memory network architecture to perform this task. We incorporated the interests of users with external memory. A hierarchical attention mechanism was also applied to better consider the interests of users. The experimental results on a dataset we collected from Twitter demonstrated that the proposed method could outperform state-of-the-art approaches.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/260	Haoran Huang, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang
Semi-supervised Max-margin Topic Model with Manifold Posterior Regularization	Supervised topic models leverage label information to learn discriminative latent topic representations. As collecting a fully labeled dataset is often time-consuming, semi-supervised learning is of high interest. In this paper, we present an effective semi-supervised max-margin topic model by naturally introducing manifold posterior regularization to a regularized Bayesian topic model, named LapMedLDA. The model jointly learns latent topics and a related classifier with only a small fraction of labeled documents. To perform the approximate inference, we derive an efficient stochastic gradient MCMC method. Unlike the previous semi-supervised topic models, our model adopts a tight coupling between the generative topic model and the discriminative classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate that such tight coupling brings significant benefits in quantitative and qualitative performance.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/259	Wenbo Hu, Jun Zhu, Hang Su, Jingwei Zhuo, Bo Zhang
Diversifying Personalized Recommendation with User-session Context	Recommender systems (RS) have become an integral part of our daily life. However, most current RS often repeatedly recommend items to users with similar profiles. We argue that recommendation should be diversified by leveraging session contexts with personalized user profiles. For this, current session-based RS (SBRS) often assume a rigidly ordered sequence over data which does not fit in many real-world cases. Moreover, personalization is often omitted in current SBRS. Accordingly, a personalized SBRS over relaxedly ordered user-session contexts is more pragmatic. In doing so, deep-structured models tend to be too complex to serve for online SBRS owing to the large number of users and items. Therefore, we design an efficient SBRS with shallow wide-in-wide-out networks, inspired by the successful experience in modern language modelings. The experiments on a real-world e-commerce dataset show the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/258	Liang Hu, Longbing Cao, Shoujin Wang, Guandong Xu, Jian Cao, Zhiping Gu
Fast Recursive Low-rank Tensor Learning for Regression	In this work, we develop a fast sequential low-rank tensor regression framework, namely recursive higher-order partial least squares (RHOPLS). It addresses the great challenges posed by the limited storage space and fast processing time required by dynamic environments when dealing with large-scale high-speed general tensor sequences. Smartly integrating a low-rank modification strategy of Tucker into a PLS-based framework, we efficiently update the regression coefficients by effectively merging the new data into the previous low-rank approximation of the model at a small-scale factor (feature) level instead of the large raw data (observation) level. Unlike batch models, which require accessing the entire data, RHOPLS conducts a blockwise recursive calculation scheme and thus only a small set of factors is needed to be stored. Our approach is orders of magnitude faster than all other methods while maintaining a highly comparable predictability with the cutting-edge batch methods, as verified on challenging real-life tasks.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/257	Ming Hou, Brahim Chaib-draa
Storage Fit Learning with Unlabeled Data	By using abundant unlabeled data, semi-supervised learning approaches have been found very useful in various tasks. Existing approaches, however, neglect the fact that the storage available for the learning process is different under different situations, and thus, the learning approaches should be flexible subject to the storage budget limit. In this paper, we focus on graph-based semi-supervised learning and propose two storage fit learning approaches which can adjust their behaviors to different storage budgets. Specifically, we utilize techniques of low-rank matrix approximation to find a low-rank approximator of the similarity matrix so as to reduce the space complexity. The first approach is based on stochastic optimization, which is an iterative approach that converges to the optimal low-rank approximator globally. The second approach is based on Nystrom method, which can find a good low-rank approximator efficiently and is suitable for real-time applications. Experiments on classification tasks show that the proposed methods can fit dynamically different storage budgets and obtain good performances in different scenarios.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/256	Bo-Jian Hou, Lijun Zhang, Zhi-Hua Zhou
Category-aware Next Point-of-Interest Recommendation via Listwise Bayesian Personalized Ranking	Next Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation has become an important task for location-based social networks (LBSNs). However, previous efforts suffer from the high computational complexity and the transition pattern between POIs has not been well studied. In this paper, we propose a two-fold approach for next POI recommendation. First, the preferred next category is predicted by using a third-rank tensor optimized by a Listwise Bayesian Personalized Ranking (LBPR) approach. Specifically we introduce two functions, namely Plackett-Luce model and cross entropy, to generate the likelihood of ranking list for posterior computation. Then POI candidates filtered by the predicated category are ranked based on the spatial influence and category ranking influence. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the significant improvements of our methods over several state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/255	Jing He, Xin Li, Lejian Liao
Nonlinear Maximum Margin Multi-View Learning with Adaptive Kernel	Existing multi-view learning methods based on kernel function either require the user to select and tune a single predefined kernel or have to compute and store many Gram matrices to perform multiple kernel learning. Apart from the huge consumption of manpower, computation and memory resources, most of these models seek point estimation of their parameters, and are prone to overfitting to small training data. This paper presents an adaptive kernel nonlinear max-margin multi-view learning model under the Bayesian framework. Specifically, we regularize the posterior of an efficient multi-view latent variable model by explicitly mapping the latent representations extracted from multiple data views to a random Fourier feature space where max-margin classification constraints are imposed. Assuming these random features are drawn from Dirichlet process Gaussian mixtures, we can adaptively learn shift-invariant kernels from data according to Bochners theorem. For inference, we employ the data augmentation idea for hinge loss, and design an efficient gradient-based MCMC sampler in the augmented space. Having no need to compute the Gram matrix, our algorithm scales linearly with the size of training set. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method has superior performance.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/254	Jia He, Changying Du, Changde Du, Fuzhen Zhuang, Qing He, Guoping Long
Online Multitask Relative Similarity Learning	Relative similarity learning~(RSL) aims to learn similarity functions from data with relative constraints. Most previous algorithms developed for RSL are batch-based learning approaches which suffer from poor scalability when dealing with real-world data arriving sequentially. These methods are often designed to learn a single similarity function for a specific task. Therefore, they may be sub-optimal to solve multiple task learning problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose a scalable RSL framework named OMTRSL (Online Multi-Task Relative Similarity Learning). Specifically, we first develop a simple yet effective online learning algorithm for multi-task relative similarity learning. Then, we also propose an active learning algorithm to save the labeling cost. The proposed algorithms not only enjoy theoretical guarantee, but also show high efficacy and efficiency in extensive experiments on real-world datasets.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/253	Shuji Hao, Peilin Zhao, Yong Liu, Steven C.

Self-paced Mixture of Regressions	Mixture of regressions (MoR) is the well-established and effective approach to model discontinuous and heterogeneous data in regression problems. Existing MoR approaches assume smooth joint distribution for its good anlaytic properties. However, such assumption makes existing MoR very sensitive to intra-component outliers (the noisy training data residing in certain components) and the inter-component imbalance (the different amounts of training data in different components). In this paper, we make the earliest effort on Self-paced Learning (SPL) in MoR, i.e., Self-paced mixture of regressions (SPMoR) model. We propose a novel self-paced regularizer based on the Exclusive LASSO, which improves inter-component balance of training data. As a robust learning regime, SPL pursues confidence sample reasoning. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SPMoR, we conducted experiments on both the sythetic examples and real-world applications to age estimation and glucose estimation. The results show that SPMoR outperforms the state-of-the-arts methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/252	Longfei Han, Dingwen Zhang, Dong Huang, Xiaojun Chang, Jun Ren, Senlin Luo, Junwei Han
Orthogonal and Nonnegative Graph Reconstruction for Large Scale Clustering	Spectral clustering has been widely used due to its simplicity for solving graph clustering problem in recent years. However, it suffers from the high computational cost as data grow in scale, and is limited by the performance of post-processing. To address these two problems simultaneously, in this paper, we propose a novel approach denoted by orthogonal and nonnegative graph reconstruction (ONGR) that scales linearly with the data size. For the relaxation of Normalized Cut, we add nonnegative constraint to the objective. Due to the nonnegativity, ONGR offers interpretability that the final cluster labels can be directly obtained without post-processing. Extensive experiments on clustering tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/251	Junwei Han, Kai Xiong, Feiping Nie
Knowledge Transfer for Out-of-Knowledge-Base Entities : A Graph Neural Network Approach	Knowledge base completion (KBC) aims to predict missing information in a knowledge base. In this paper, we address the out-of-knowledge-base (OOKB) entity problem in KBC: how to answer queries concerning test entities not observed at training time. Existing embedding-based KBC models assume that all test entities are available at training time, making it unclear how to obtain embeddings for new entities without costly retraining. To solve the OOKB entity problem without retraining, we use graph neural networks (Graph-NNs) to compute the embeddings of OOKB entities, exploiting the limited auxiliary knowledge provided at test time. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed model in the OOKB setting. Additionally, in the standard KBC setting in which OOKB entities are not involved, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WordNet dataset.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/250	Takuo Hamaguchi, Hidekazu Oiwa, Masashi Shimbo, Yuji Matsumoto
Instability Prediction in Power Systems using Recurrent Neural Networks	Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) can model temporal dependencies in time series well. In this paper we present an interesting application of stacked Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) based RNN for early prediction of imminent instability in a power system based on normal measurements of power system variables over time. In a power system, disturbances like a fault can result in transient instability which may lead to blackouts. Early pre-diction of any such contingency can aid the operator to take timely preventive control actions. In recent times some machine learning techniques such as SVMs have been proposed to predict such instability. However, these approaches assume availability of accurate fault information like its occurrence and clearance instants which is impractical. In this paper we propose an Online Monitoring System (OMS), which is a GRU based RNN, that continuously keeps predicting the current status based on past measurements. Through extensive simulations using a standard 118-bus system, the effectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated. We also show how we can use PCA and predictions from the RNN to identify the most critical generator that leads to transient instability.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/249	Ankita Gupta, Gurunath Gurrala, Pidaparthy S Sastry
Improved Strong Worst-case Upper Bounds for MDP Planning	The Markov Decision Problem (MDP) plays a central role in AI as an abstraction of sequential decision making. We contribute to the theoretical analysis of MDP PLANNING, which is the problem of computing an optimal policy for a given MDP. Specifically, we furnish improved STRONG WORST-CASE upper bounds on the running time of MDP planning. Strong bounds are those that depend only on the number of states n and the number of actions k in the specified MDP; they have no dependence on affiliated variables such as the discount factor and the number of bits needed to represent the MDP. Worst-case bounds apply to EVERY run of an algorithm; randomised algorithms can typically yield faster EXPECTED running times. While the special case of 2-action MDPs (that is, k = 2) has recently received some attention, bounds for general k have remained to be improved for several decades. Our contributions are to this general case. For k >= 3, the tightest strong upper bound shown to date for MDP planning belongs to a family of algorithms called Policy Iteration. This bound is only a polynomial improvement over a trivial bound of poly(n, k) k^{n} [Mansour and Singh, 1999]. In this paper, we generalise a contrasting algorithm called the Fibonacci Seesaw, and derive a bound of poly(n, k) k^{0.6834n}. The key construct we use is a template to map algorithms for the 2-action setting to the general setting. Interestingly, this idea can also be used to design Policy Iteration algorithms with a running time upper bound of poly(n, k) k^{0.7207n}. Both our results improve upon bounds that have stood for several decades.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/248	Anchit Gupta, Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan
Understanding Users' Budgets for Recommendation with Hierarchical Poisson Factorization	People consume and rate products in online shopping websites. The historical purchases of customers reflect their personal consumption habits and indicate their future shopping behaviors. Traditional preference-based recommender systems try to provide recommendations by analyzing users' feedback such as ratings and clicks. But unfortunately, most of the existing recommendation algorithms ignore the budget of the users. So they cannot avoid recommending users with products that will exceed their budgets. And they also cannot understand how the users will assign their budgets to different products. In this paper, we develop a generative model named collaborative budget-aware Poisson factorization (CBPF) to connect users' ratings and budgets. The CBPF model is intuitive and highly interpretable. We compare the proposed model with several state-of-the-art budget-unaware recommendation methods on several real-world datasets. The results show the advantage of uncovering users' budgets for recommendation.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/247	Yunhui Guo, Congfu Xu, Hanzhang Song, Xin Wang
Synthesizing Samples for Zero-shot Learning	Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is to construct recognition models for unseen target classes that have no labeled samples for training. It utilizes the class attributes or semantic vectors as side information and transfers supervision information from related source classes with abundant labeled samples. Existing ZSL approaches adopt an intermediary embedding space to measure the similarity between a sample and the attributes of a target class to perform zero-shot classification. However, this way may suffer from the information loss caused by the embedding process and the similarity measure cannot fully make use of the data distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel approach which turns the ZSL problem into a conventional supervised learning problem by synthesizing samples for the unseen classes. Firstly, the probability distribution of an unseen class is estimated by using the knowledge from seen classes and the class attributes. Secondly, the samples are synthesized based on the distribution for the unseen class. Finally, we can train any supervised classifiers based on the synthesized samples. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach to the state-of-the-art ZSL approaches.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/246	Yuchen Guo, Guiguang Ding, Jungong Han, Yue Gao
SitNet: Discrete Similarity Transfer Network for Zero-shot Hashing	Hashing has been widely utilized for fast image retrieval recently. With semantic information as supervision, hashing approaches perform much better, especially when combined with deep convolution neural network(CNN). However, in practice, new concepts emerge every day, making collecting supervised information for re-training hashing model infeasible. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot hashing approach, called Discrete Similarity Transfer Network (SitNet), to preserve the semantic similarity between images from both ``seen'' concepts and new ``unseen'' concepts. Motivated by zero-shot learning, the semantic vectors of concepts are adopted to capture the similarity structures among classes, making the model trained with seen concepts generalize well for unseen ones benefiting from the transferability of the semantic vector space. We adopt a multi-task architecture to exploit the supervised information for seen concepts and the semantic vectors simultaneously. Moreover, a discrete hashing layer is integrated into the network for hashcode generating to avoid the information loss caused by real-value relaxation in training phase, which is a critical problem in existing works. Experiments on three benchmarks validate the superiority of SitNet to the state-of-the-arts.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/245	Yuchen Guo, Guiguang Ding, Jungong Han, Yue Gao
Robust Asymmetric Bayesian Adaptive Matrix Factorization	Low rank matrix factorizations(LRMF) have attracted much attention due to its wide range of applications in computer vision, such as image impainting and video denoising. Most of the existing methods assume that the loss between an observed measurement matrix and its bilinear factorization follows symmetric distribution, like gaussian or gamma families. However, in real-world situations, this assumption is often found too idealized, because pictures under various illumination and angles may suffer from multi-peaks, asymmetric and irregular noises. To address these problems, this paper assumes that the loss follows a mixture of Asymmetric Laplace distributions and proposes robust Asymmetric Laplace Adaptive Matrix Factorization model(ALAMF) under bayesian matrix factorization framework. The assumption of Laplace distribution makes our model more robust and the asymmetric attribute makes our model more flexible and adaptable to real-world noise. A variational method is then devised for model inference. We compare ALAMF with other state-of-the-art matrix factorization methods both on data sets ranging from synthetic and real-world application. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/244	Xin Guo, Boyuan Pan, Deng Cai, Xiaofei He
Improved Deep Embedded Clustering with Local Structure Preservation	Deep clustering learns deep feature representations that favor clustering task using neural networks. Some pioneering work proposes to simultaneously learn embedded features and perform clustering by explicitly defining a clustering oriented loss. Though promising performance has been demonstrated in various applications, we observe that a vital ingredient has been overlooked by these work that the defined clustering loss may corrupt feature space, which leads to non-representative meaningless features and this in turn hurts clustering performance. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the Improved Deep Embedded Clustering (IDEC) algorithm to take care of data structure preservation. Specifically, we manipulate feature space to scatter data points using a clustering loss as guidance. To constrain the manipulation and maintain the local structure of data generating distribution, an under-complete autoencoder is applied. By integrating the clustering loss and autoencoder's reconstruction loss, IDEC can jointly optimize cluster labels assignment and learn features that are suitable for clustering with local structure preservation. The resultant optimization problem can be effectively solved by mini-batch stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation. Experiments on image and text datasets empirically validate the importance of local structure preservation and the effectiveness of our algorithm.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/243	Xifeng Guo, Long Gao, Xinwang Liu, Jianping Yin
ROUTE: Robust Outlier Estimation for Low Rank Matrix Recovery	In practice, even very high-dimensional data are typically sampled from low-dimensional subspaces but with intrusion of outliers and/or noises. Recovering the underlying structure and the pollution from the observations is key to understanding and processing such data. Besides properly modeling the low-rank structure of subspace, how to handle the pollution, is core regarding the performance of recovery. Often, the observed data is posed as a superimposition of the clean data and residual, while the residual can be roughly divided into two groups, including small dense noises and gross sparse outliers. Compared with small noises, outliers more likely ruin the recovery, as they can be arbitrarily large. By considering the above, this paper designs a method for recovering the low rank matrix with robust outlier estimation, termed as ROUTE, in a unified manner. Theoretical analysis on convergence and optimality, and experimental results on both synthetic and real data are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method and show its superiority over other state-of-the-arts.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/242	Xiaojie Guo, Zhouchen Lin
Exclusivity Regularized Machine: A New Ensemble SVM Classifier	The diversity of base learners is of utmost importance to a good ensemble. This paper defines a novel measurement of diversity, termed as exclusivity. With the designed exclusivity, we further propose an ensemble SVM classifier, namely Exclusivity Regularized Machine (ExRM), to jointly suppress the training error of ensemble and enhance the diversity between bases. Moreover, an Augmented Lagrange Multiplier based algorithm is customized to effectively and efficiently seek the optimal solution of ExRM. Theoretical analysis on convergence, global optimality and linear complexity of the proposed algorithm, as well as experiments are provided to reveal the efficacy of our method and show its superiority over state-of-the-arts in terms of accuracy and efficiency.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/241	Xiaojie Guo, Xiaobo Wang, Haibin Ling
A Density-based Nonparametric Model for Online Event Discovery from the Social Media Data	In this paper, we propose a novel online event discovery model DP-density to capture various events from the social media data. The proposed model can flexibly accommodate the incremental arriving of the social documents in an online manner by leveraging Dirichlet Process, and a density based technique is exploited to deduce the temporal dynamics of events. The spatial patterns of events are also incorporated in the model by a mixture of Gaussians. To remove the bias caused by the streaming process of the documents, Sequential Monte Carlo is used for the parameter inference. Our extensive experiments over two different real datasets show that the proposed model is capable to extract interpretable events effectively in terms of perplexity and coherence.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/240	Jinjin Guo, Zhiguo Gong
DeepFM: A Factorization-Machine based Neural Network for CTR Prediction	"Learning sophisticated feature interactions behind user behaviors is critical in maximizing CTR for recommender systems. Despite great progress, existing methods seem to have a strong bias towards low- or high-order interactions, or require expertise feature engineering. In this paper, we show that it is possible to derive an end-to-end learning model that emphasizes both low- and high-order feature interactions. The proposed model, DeepFM, combines the power of factorization machines for recommendation and deep learning for feature learning in a new neural network architecture. Compared to the latest Wide & Deep model from Google, DeepFM has a shared input to its ""wide"" and ""deep"" parts, with no need of feature engineering besides raw features. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DeepFM over the existing models for CTR prediction, on both benchmark data and commercial data."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/239	Huifeng Guo, Ruiming TANG, Yunming Ye, Zhenguo Li, Xiuqiang He
Extracting Visual Knowledge from the Web with Multimodal Learning	We consider the problem of automatically extracting visual objects from web images. Despite the extraordinary advancement in deep learning, visual object detection remains a challenging task. To overcome the deficiency of pure visual techniques, we propose to make use of meta text surrounding images on the Web for enhanced detection accuracy. In this paper we present a multimodal learning algorithm to integrate text information into visual knowledge extraction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we developed a system that takes raw webpages as input, and automatically extracts visual knowledge (e.g. object bounding boxes) from tens of millions of images crawled from the Web. Experimental results based on 46 object categories show that the extraction precision is improved significantly from 73% (with state-of-the-art deep learning programs) to 81%, which is equivalent to a 31% reduction in error rates.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/238	Dihong Gong, Daisy Zhe Wang
Sample Efficient Policy Search for Optimal Stopping Domains	Optimal stopping problems consider the question of deciding when to stop an observation-generating process in order to maximize a return. We examine the problem of simultaneously learning and planning in such domains, when data is collected directly from the environment. We propose GFSE, a simple and flexible model-free policy search method that reuses data for sample efficiency by leveraging problem structure. We bound the sample complexity of our approach to guarantee uniform convergence of policy value estimates, tightening existing PAC bounds to achieve logarithmic dependence on horizon length for our setting. We also examine the benefit of our method against prevalent model-based and model-free approaches on 3 domains taken from diverse fields.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/237	Karan Goel, Christoph Dann, Emma Brunskill
Towards Understanding the Invertibility of Convolutional Neural Networks	Several recent works have empirically observed that Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs) are (approximately) invertible. To understand this approximate invertibility phenomenon and how to leverage it more effectively, we focus on a theoretical explanation and develop a mathematical model of sparse signal recovery that is consistent with CNNs with random weights. We give an exact connection to a particular model of model-based compressive sensing (and its recovery algorithms) and random-weight CNNs. We show empirically that several learned networks are consistent with our mathematical analysis and then demonstrate that with such a simple theoretical framework, we can obtain reasonable reconstruction results on real images. We also discuss gaps between our model assumptions and the CNN trained for classification in practical scenarios.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/236	Anna Gilbert, Yi Zhang, Kibok Lee, Yuting Zhang, Honglak Lee
Neurogenesis-Inspired Dictionary Learning: Online Model Adaption in a Changing World	"We address the problem of online model adaptation when learning representations from non-stationary data streams. Specifically, we focus here on online dictionary learning (i.e. sparse linear autoencoder), and propose a simple but effective online model selection approach involving ""birth"" (addition) and ""death"" (removal) of hidden units representing dictionary elements, in response to changing inputs; we draw inspiration from the adult neurogenesis phenomenon in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, known to be associated with better adaptation to new environments. Empirical evaluation on real-life datasets (images and text), as well as on synthetic data, demonstrates that the proposed approach can considerably outperform the state-of-art non-adaptive online sparse coding of [Mairal et al., 2009] in the presence of non-stationary data. Moreover, we identify certain data- and model properties associated with such improvements."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/235	Sahil Garg, Irina Rish, Guillermo Cecchi, Aurelie Lozano
Identifying Human Mobility via Trajectory Embeddings	Understanding human trajectory patterns is an important task in many location based social networks (LBSNs) applications, such as personalized recommendation and preference-based route planning. Most of the existing methods classify a trajectory (or its segments) based on spatio-temporal values and activities, into some predefined categories, e.g., walking or jogging. We tackle a novel trajectory classification problem: we identify and link trajectories to users who generate them in the LBSNs, a problem called Trajectory-User Linking (TUL). Solving the TUL problem is not a trivial task because: (1) the number of the classes (i.e., users) is much larger than the number of motion patterns in the common trajectory classification problems; and (2) the location based trajectory data, especially the check-ins, are often extremely sparse. To address these challenges, a Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) based semi-supervised learning model, called TULER (TUL via Embedding and RNN) is proposed, which exploits the spatio-temporal data to capture the underlying semantics of user mobility patterns. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that TULER achieves better accuracy than the existing methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/234	Qiang Gao, Fan Zhou, Kunpeng Zhang, Goce Trajcevski, Xucheng Luo, Fengli Zhang
SVD-Based Screening for the Graphical Lasso	The graphical lasso is the most popular approach to estimating the inverse covariance matrix of high-dimension data. It iteratively estimates each row and column of the matrix in a round-robin style until convergence. However, the graphical lasso is infeasible due to its high computation cost for large size of datasets. This paper proposes Sting, a fast approach to the graphical lasso. In order to reduce the computation cost, it efficiently identifies blocks in the estimated matrix that have nonzero elements before entering the iterations by exploiting the singular value decomposition of data matrix. In addition, it selectively updates elements of the estimated matrix expected to have nonzero values. Theoretically, it guarantees to converge to the same result as the original algorithm of the graphical lasso. Experiments show that our approach is faster than existing approaches.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/233	Yasuhiro Fujiwara, Naoki Marumo, Mathieu Blondel, Koh Takeuchi, Hideaki Kim, Tomoharu Iwata, Naonori Ueda
On the Complexity of Learning from Label Proportions	In the problem of learning with label proportions (also known as the problem of estimating class ratios), the training data is unlabeled, and only the proportions of examples receiving each label are given. The goal is to learn a hypothesis that predicts the proportions of labels on the distribution underlying the sample. This model of learning is useful in a wide variety of settings, including predicting the number of votes for candidates in political elections from polls. In this paper, we resolve foundational questions regarding the computational complexity of learning in this setting. We formalize a simple version of the setting, and we compare the computational complexity of learning in this model to classical PAC learning. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that what can be learned efficiently in this model is a strict subset of what may be leaned efficiently in PAC, under standard complexity assumptions. We give a characterization in terms of VC dimension, and we show that there are non-trivial problems in this model that can be efficiently learned. We also give an algorithm that demonstrates the feasibility of learning under well-behaved distributions.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/232	Benjamin Fish, Lev Reyzin
Dynamic Multi-Task Learning with Convolutional Neural Network	Multi-task learning and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) have been successfully used in various fields. This paper considers the integration of CNN and multi-task learning in a novel way to further improve the performance of multiple related tasks. Existing multi-task CNN models usually empirically combine different tasks into a group which is then trained jointly with a strong assumption of model commonality. Furthermore, traditional approaches usually only consider small number of tasks with rigid structure, which is not suitable for large-scale applications. In light of this, we propose a dynamic multi-task CNN model to handle these problems. The proposed model directly learns the task relations from data instead of subjective task grouping. Due to its flexible structure, it supports task-wise incremental training, which is useful for efficient training of massive tasks. Specifically, we add a new task transfer connection (TTC) between the layers of each task. The learned TTC is able to reflect the correlation among different tasks guiding the model dynamically adjusting the multiplexing of the information among different tasks. With the help of TTC, multiple related tasks can further boost the whole performance for each other. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed dynamic multi-task CNN model outperforms traditional approaches.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/231	Yuchun Fang, Zhengyan Ma, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Xu-Yao Zhang, Xiang Bai
Object Detection Meets Knowledge Graphs	Object detection in images is a crucial task in computer vision, with important applications ranging from security surveillance to autonomous vehicles. Existing state-of-the-art algorithms, including deep neural networks, only focus on utilizing features within an image itself, largely neglecting the vast amount of background knowledge about the real world. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of knowledge-aware object detection, which enables the integration of external knowledge such as knowledge graphs into any object detection algorithm. The framework employs the notion of semantic consistency to quantify and generalize knowledge, which improves object detection through a re-optimization process to achieve better consistency with background knowledge. Finally, empirical evaluation on two benchmark datasets show that our approach can significantly increase recall by up to 6.3 points without compromising mean average precision, when compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/230	Yuan Fang, Kingsley Kuan, Jie Lin, Cheston Tan, Vijay Chandrasekhar
Improved Bounded Matrix Completion for Large-Scale Recommender Systems	Matrix completion is a widely used technique for personalized recommender system. In this paper, we focus on the idea of Bounded Matrix Completion (BMC) which imposes bounded constraint into the original matrix completion problem. It has been shown that BMC works well for several real world datasets, and an efficient coordinate descent solver called BMA has been proposed in~\cite{bma}. However, we observe that the BMA algorithm sometimes fails to converge to a stationary point, resulting in a relatively poor accuracy in those cases. To overcome this issue, we propose our new approach for solving BMC under the ADMM framework. The proposed algorithm is gauranteed to converge to stationary points. Experimental results on real world datasets show that our algorithm can reach a lower objective value, obtain a higher predict accuracy rate and have better scalability compared with BMA. We also present that our method outperforms the state-of-art standard matrix factorization in most cases.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/229	Huang Fang, Zhang Zhen, Yiqun Shao, Cho-Jui Hsieh
Top-k Supervise Feature Selection via ADMM for Integer Programming	Recently, structured sparsity inducing based feature selection has become a hot topic in machine learning and pattern recognition. Most of the sparsity inducing feature selection methods are designed to rank all features by certain criterion and then select the k top ranked features, where k is an integer. However, the k top features are usually not the top k features and therefore maybe a suboptimal result. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised feature selection method to directly identify the top k features. The new method is formulated as a classic regularized least squares regression model with two groups of variables. The problem with respect to one group of the variables turn out to be a 0-1 integer programming, which had been considered very hard to solve. To address this, we utilize an efficient optimization method to solve the integer programming, which first replaces the discrete 0-1 constraints with two continuous constraints and then utilizes the alternating direction method of multipliers to optimize the equivalent problem. The obtained result is the top subset with k features under the proposed criterion rather than the subset of k top features. Experiments have been conducted on benchmark data sets to show the effectiveness of proposed method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/228	Mingyu Fan, Xiaojun Chang, Xiaoqin Zhang, Di Wang, Liang Du
Learning to Learn Programs from Examples: Going Beyond Program Structure	Programming-by-example technologies let end users construct and run new programs by providing examples of the intended program behavior. But, the few provided examples seldom uniquely determine the intended program. Previous approaches to picking a program used a bias toward shorter or more naturally structured programs. Our work here gives a machine learning approach for learning to learn programs that departs from previous work by relying upon features that are independent of the program structure, instead relying upon a learned bias over program behaviors, and more generally over program execution traces. Our approach leverages abundant unlabeled data for semisupervised learning, and incorporates simple kinds of world knowledge for common-sense reasoning during program induction. These techniques are evaluated in two programming-by-example domains, improving the accuracy of program learners.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/227	Kevin Ellis, Sumit Gulwani
Clustering-Based Relational Unsupervised Representation Learning with an Explicit Distributed Representation	The goal of unsupervised representation learning is to extract a new representation of data, such that solving many different tasks becomes easier. Existing methods typically focus on vectorized data and offer little support for relational data, which additionally describes relationships among instances. In this work we introduce an approach for relational unsupervised representation learning. Viewing a relational dataset as a hypergraph, new features are obtained by clustering vertices and hyperedges. To find a representation suited for many relational learning tasks, a wide range of similarities between relational objects is considered, e.g. feature and structural similarities. We experimentally evaluate the proposed approach and show that models learned on such latent representations perform better, have lower complexity, and outperform the existing approaches on classification tasks.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/226	Sebastijan Dumancic, Hendrik Blockeel
Semi-Supervised Learning for Surface EMG-based Gesture Recognition	Conventionally, gesture recognition based on non-intrusive muscle-computer interfaces required a strongly-supervised learning algorithm and a large amount of labeled training signals of surface electromyography (sEMG). In this work, we show that temporal relationship of sEMG signals and data glove provides implicit supervisory signal for learning the gesture recognition model. To demonstrate this, we present a semi-supervised learning framework with a novel Siamese architecture for sEMG-based gesture recognition. Specifically, we employ auxiliary tasks to learn visual representation; predicting the temporal order of two consecutive sEMG frames; and, optionally, predicting the statistics of 3D hand pose with a sEMG frame. Experiments on the NinaPro, CapgMyo and csl-hdemg datasets validate the efficacy of our proposed approach, especially when the labeled samples are very scarce.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/225	Yu Du, Yongkang Wong, Wenguang Jin, Wentao Wei, Yu Hu, Mohan Kankanhalli, Weidong Geng
Collaborative Rating Allocation	This paper studies the collaborative rating allocation problem, in which each user has limited ratings on all items. These users are termed ``energy limited''. Different from existing methods which treat each rating independently, we investigate the geometric properties of a user's rating vector, and design a matrix completion method on the simplex. In this method, a user's rating vector is estimated by the combination of user profiles as basis points on the simplex. Instead of using Euclidean metric, a non-linear pull-back distance measurement from the sphere is adopted since it can depict the geometric constraints on each user's rating vector. The resulting objective function is then efficiently optimized by a Riemannian conjugate gradient method on the simplex. Experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate our model's competitiveness versus other collaborative rating prediction methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/224	Yali Du, Chang Xu, Dacheng Tao
Privileged Matrix Factorization for Collaborative Filtering	Collaborative filtering plays a crucial role in reducing excessive information in online consuming by suggesting products to customers that fulfil their potential interests. Observing that a user's review comments on purchases are often in companion with ratings, recent works exploit the review texts in representing user or item factors and have achieved prominent performance. Although effectiveness of reviews has been verified, one major defect of existing works is that reviews are used in justifying the learning of either user or item factors without noticing that each review associates a pair of user and item concurrently. To better explore the value of review comments, this paper presents the privileged matrix factorization method that utilize reviews in the learning of both user and item factors. By mapping review texts into the privileged feature space, a learned privileged function compensates the discrepancies between predicted ratings and groundtruth values rating-wisely. Thus by minimizing discrepancies and prediction errors, our method harnesses the information present in the review comments for the learning of both user and item factors. Experiments on five real datasets testify the effectiveness of the proposed method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/223	Yali Du, Chang Xu, Dacheng Tao
Autoencoder Regularized Network For Driving Style Representation Learning	In this paper, we study learning generalized driving style representations from automobile GPS trip data. We propose a novel Autoencoder Regularized deep neural Network (ARNet) and a trip encoding framework trip2vec to learn drivers' driving styles directly from GPS records, by combining supervised and unsupervised feature learning in a unified architecture. Experiments on a challenging driver number estimation problem and the driver identification problem show that ARNet can learn a good generalized driving style representation: It significantly outperforms existing methods and alternative architectures by reaching the least estimation error on average (0.68, less than one driver) and the highest identification accuracy (by at least 3% improvement) compared with traditional supervised learning methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/222	Weishan Dong, Ting Yuan, Kai Yang, Changsheng Li, Shilei Zhang
Logic Tensor Networks for Semantic Image Interpretation	Semantic Image Interpretation (SII) is the task of extracting structured semantic descriptions from images. It is widely agreed that the combined use of visual data and background knowledge is of great importance for SII. Recently, Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) approaches have been developed for reasoning under uncertainty and learning in the presence of data and rich knowledge. Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) are a SRL framework which integrates neural networks with first-order fuzzy logic to allow (i) efficient learning from noisy data in the presence of logical constraints, and (ii) reasoning with logical formulas describing general properties of the data. In this paper, we develop and apply LTNs to two of the main tasks of SII, namely, the classification of an image's bounding boxes and the detection of the relevant part-of relations between objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of SRL to such SII tasks. The proposed approach is evaluated on a standard image processing benchmark. Experiments show that background knowledge in the form of logical constraints can improve the performance of purely data-driven approaches, including the state-of-the-art Fast Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Fast R-CNN). Moreover, we show that the use of logical background knowledge adds robustness to the learning system when errors are present in the labels of the training data.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/221	Ivan Donadello, Luciano Serafini, Artur d'Avila Garcez
Disguise Adversarial Networks for Click-through Rate Prediction	We introduced an adversarial learning framework for improving CTR prediction in Ads recommendation. Our approach was motivated by observing the extremely low click-through rate and imbalanced label distribution in the historical Ads impressions. We hence proposed a Disguise-Adversarial-Networks (DAN) to improve the accuracy of supervised learning with limited positive-class information. In the context of CTR prediction, the rationality behind DAN could be intuitively understood as ``non-clicked Ads makeup''. DAN disguises the disliked Ads impressions (non-clicks) to be interesting ones and encourages a discriminator to classify these disguised Ads as positive recommendations. In an adversarial aspect, the discriminator should be sober-minded which is optimized to allocate these disguised Ads to their inherent classes according to an unsupervised information theoretic assignment strategy. We applied DAN to two Ads datasets including both mobile and display Ads for CTR prediction. The results showed that our DAN approach significantly outperformed other supervised learning and generative adversarial networks (GAN) in CTR prediction.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/220	Yue Deng, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin
Real-Time Navigation in Classical Platform Games via Skill Reuse	"In platform videogames, players are frequently tasked with solving medium-term navigation problems in order to gather items or powerups. Artificial agents must generally obtain some form of direct experience before they can solve such tasks. Experience is gained either through training runs, or by exploiting knowledge of the game's physics to generate detailed simulations. Human players, on the other hand, seem to look ahead in high-level, abstract steps. Motivated by human play, we introduce an approach that leverages not only abstract ""skills"", but also knowledge of what those skills can and cannot achieve. We apply this approach to Infinite Mario, where despite facing randomly generated, maze-like levels, our agent is capable of deriving complex plans in real-time, without relying on perfect knowledge of the game's physics."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/219	Michael Dann, Fabio Zambetta, John Thangarajah
Analogy-preserving functions: A way to extend Boolean samples	Training set extension is an important issue in machine learning. Indeed when the examples at hand are in a limited quantity, the performances of standard classifiers may significantly decrease and it can be helpful to build additional examples. In this paper, we consider the use of analogical reasoning, and more particularly of analogical proportions for extending training sets. Here the ground truth labels are considered to be given by a (partially known) function. We examine the conditions that are required for such functions to ensure an error-free extension in a Boolean setting. To this end, we introduce the notion of Analogy Preserving (AP) functions, and we prove that their class is the class of affine Boolean functions. This noteworthy theoretical result is complemented with an empirical investigation of approximate AP functions, which suggests that they remain suitable for training set extension.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/218	Miguel Couceiro, Nicolas Hug, Henri Prade, Gilles Richard
Further Results on Predicting Cognitive Abilities for Adaptive Visualizations	Previous work has shown that some user cognitive abilities relevant for processing information visualizations can be predicted from eye tracking data. Performing this type of user modeling is important for devising user-adaptive visualizations that can adapt to a user's abilities as needed during the interaction. In this paper, we contribute to previous work by extending the type of visualizations considered and the set of cognitive abilities that can be predicted from gaze data, thus providing evidence on the generality of these findings. We also evaluate how quality of gaze data impacts prediction.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/217	Cristina Conati, Sébastien Lallé, Md. Abed Rahman, Dereck Toker
Stacked Similarity-Aware Autoencoders	As one of the most popular unsupervised learning approaches, the autoencoder aims at transforming the inputs to the outputs with the least discrepancy. The conventional autoencoder and most of its variants only consider the one-to-one reconstruction, which ignores the intrinsic structure of the data and may lead to overfitting. In order to preserve the latent geometric information in the data, we propose the stacked similarity-aware autoencoders. To train each single autoencoder, we first obtain the pseudo class label of each sample by clustering the input features. Then the hidden codes of those samples sharing the same category label will be required to satisfy an additional similarity constraint. Specifically, the similarity constraint is implemented based on an extension of the recently proposed center loss. With this joint supervision of the autoencoder reconstruction error and the center loss, the learned feature representations not only can reconstruct the original data, but also preserve the geometric structure of the data. Furthermore, a stacked framework is introduced to boost the representation capacity. The experimental results on several benchmark datasets show the remarkable performance improvement of the proposed algorithm compared with other autoencoder based approaches.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/216	Wenqing Chu, Deng Cai
Optimal Feature Selection for Decision Robustness in Bayesian Networks	In many applications, one can define a large set of features to support the classification task at hand. At test time, however, these become prohibitively expensive to evaluate, and only a small subset of features is used, often selected for their information-theoretic value. For threshold-based, Naive Bayes classifiers, recent work has suggested selecting features that maximize the expected robustness of the classifier, that is, the expected probability it maintains its decision after seeing more features. We propose the first algorithm to compute this expected same-decision probability for general Bayesian network classifiers, based on compiling the network into a tractable circuit representation. Moreover, we develop a search algorithm for optimal feature selection that utilizes efficient incremental circuit modifications. Experiments on Naive Bayes, as well as more general networks, show the efficacy and distinct behavior of this decision-making approach.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/215	YooJung Choi, Adnan  Darwiche, Guy Van den Broeck
End-to-End Prediction of Buffer Overruns from Raw Source Code via Neural Memory Networks	Detecting buffer overruns from a source code is one of the most common and yet challenging tasks in program analysis. Current approaches based on rigid rules and handcrafted features are limited in terms of flexible applicability and robustness due to diverse bug patterns and characteristics existing in sophisticated real-world software programs. In this paper, we propose a novel, data-driven approach that is completely end-to-end without requiring any hand-crafted features, thus free from any program language-specific structural limitations. In particular, our approach leverages a recently proposed neural network model called memory networks that have shown the state-of-the-art performances mainly in question-answering tasks. Our experimental results using source code samples demonstrate that our proposed model is capable of accurately detecting different types of buffer overruns. We also present in-depth analyses on how a memory network can learn to understand the semantics in programming languages solely from raw source codes, such as tracing variables of interest, identifying numerical values, and performing their quantitative comparisons.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/214	Min-je Choi, Sehun Jeong, Hakjoo Oh, Jaegul Choo
Projection Free Rank-Drop Steps	The Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm has been widely used in solving nuclear norm constrained problems, since it does not require projections. However, FW often yields high rank intermediate iterates, which can be very expensive in time and space costs for large problems. To address this issue, we propose a rank-drop method for nuclear norm constrained problems. The goal is to generate descent steps that lead to rank decreases, maintaining low-rank solutions throughout the algorithm. Moreover, the optimization problems are constrained to ensure that the rank-drop step is also feasible and can be readily incorporated into a projection-free minimization method, e.g., Frank-Wolfe. We demonstrate that by incorporating rank-drop steps into the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, the rank of the solution is greatly reduced compared to the original Frank-Wolfe or its common variants.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/213	Edward Cheung, Yuying Li
Training Group Orthogonal Neural Networks with Privileged Information	Learning rich and diverse representations is critical for the performance of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we consider how to use privileged information to promote inherent diversity of a single CNN model such that the model can learn better representations and offer stronger generalization ability. To this end, we propose a novel group orthogonal convolutional neural network (GoCNN) that learns untangled representations within each layer by exploiting provided privileged information and enhances representation diversity effectively. We take image classification as an example where image segmentation annotations are used as privileged information during the training process. Experiments on two benchmark datasets – ImageNet and PASCAL VOC – clearly demonstrate the strong generalization ability of our proposed GoCNN model. On the ImageNet dataset, GoCNN improves the performance of state-of-the-art ResNet-152 model by absolute value of 1.2% while only uses privileged information of 10% of the training images, confirming effectiveness of GoCNN on utilizing available privileged knowledge to train better CNNs.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/212	Yunpeng Chen, Xiaojie Jin, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan
Semi-supervised Feature Selection via Rescaled Linear Regression	With the rapid increase of complex and high-dimensional sparse data, demands for new methods to select features by exploiting both labeled and unlabeled data have increased. Least regression based feature selection methods usually learn a projection matrix and evaluate the importances of features using the projection matrix, which is lack of theoretical explanation. Moreover, these methods cannot find both global and sparse solution of the projection matrix. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised feature selection method which can learn both global and sparse solution of the projection matrix. The new method extends the least square regression model by rescaling the regression coefficients in the least square regression with a set of scale factors, which are used for ranking the features. It has shown that the new model can learn global and sparse solution. Moreover, the introduction of scale factors provides a theoretical explanation for why we can use the projection matrix to rank the features. A simple yet effective algorithm with proved convergence is proposed to optimize the new model. Experimental results on eight real-life data sets show the superiority of the method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/211	Xiaojun Chen, Guowen Yuan, Feiping Nie, Joshua Zhexue Huang
Scalable Normalized Cut with Improved Spectral Rotation	Many spectral clustering algorithms have been proposed and successfully applied to many high-dimensional applications. However, there are still two problems that need to be solved: 1) existing methods for obtaining the final clustering assignments may deviate from the true discrete solution, and 2) most of these methods usually have very high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a Scalable Normalized Cut method for clustering of large scale data. In the new method, an efficient method is used to construct a small representation matrix and then clustering is performed on the representation matrix. In the clustering process, an improved spectral rotation method is proposed to obtain the solution of the final clustering assignments. A series of experimental were conducted on 14 benchmark data sets and the experimental results show the superior performance of the new method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/210	Xiaojun Chen, Feiping Nie, Joshua Zhexue Huang, Min Yang
Multilingual Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Cross-lingual Knowledge Alignment	Many recent works have demonstrated the benefits of knowledge graph embeddings in completing monolingual knowledge graphs. Inasmuch as related knowledge bases are built in several different languages, achieving cross-lingual knowledge alignment will help people in constructing a coherent knowledge base, and assist machines in dealing with different expressions of entity relationships across diverse human languages. Unfortunately, achieving this highly desirable cross-lingual alignment by human labor is very costly and error-prone. Thus, we propose MTransE, a translation-based model for multilingual knowledge graph embeddings, to provide a simple and automated solution. By encoding entities and relations of each language in a separated embedding space, MTransE provides transitions for each embedding vector to its cross-lingual counterparts in other spaces, while preserving the functionalities of monolingual embeddings. We deploy three different techniques to represent cross-lingual transitions, namely axis calibration, translation vectors, and linear transformations, and derive five variants for MTransE using different loss functions. Our models can be trained on partially aligned graphs, where just a small portion of triples are aligned with their cross-lingual counterparts. The experiments on cross-lingual entity matching and triple-wise alignment verification show promising results, with some variants consistently outperforming others on different tasks. We also explore how MTransE preserves the key properties of its monolingual counterpart.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/209	Muhao Chen, Yingtao Tian, Mohan Yang, Carlo Zaniolo
Importance-Aware Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving System	"Semantic Segmentation (SS) partitions an image into several coherent semantically meaningful parts, and classifies each part into one of the pre-determined classes. In this paper, we argue that existing SS methods cannot be reliably applied to autonomous driving system as they ignore the different importance levels of distinct classes for safe-driving. For example, pedestrians in the scene are much more important than sky when driving a car, so their segmentations should be as accurate as possible. To incorporate the importance information possessed by various object classes, this paper designs an ""Importance-Aware Loss"" (IAL) that specifically emphasizes the critical objects for autonomous driving. IAL operates under a hierarchical structure, and the classes with different importance are located in different levels so that they are assigned distinct weights. Furthermore, we derive the forward and backward propagation rules for IAL and apply them to deep neural networks for realizing SS in intelligent driving system. The experiments on CamVid and Cityscapes datasets reveal that by employing the proposed loss function, the existing deep learning models including FCN, SegNet and ENet are able to consistently obtain the improved segmentation results on the pre-defined important classes for safe-driving."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/208	Bi-ke Chen, Chen Gong, Jian Yang
Data-driven Random Fourier Features using Stein Effect	"Large-scale kernel approximation is an important problem in machine learning research. Approaches using random Fourier features have become increasingly popular \cite{Rahimi_NIPS_07}, where kernel approximation is treated as empirical mean estimation via Monte Carlo (MC) or Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration \cite{Yang_ICML_14}. A limitation of the current approaches is that all the features receive an equal weight summing to 1. In this paper, we propose a novel shrinkage estimator from ""Stein effect"", which provides a data-driven weighting strategy for random features and enjoys theoretical justifications in terms of lowering the empirical risk. We further present an efficient randomized algorithm for large-scale applications of the proposed method. Our empirical results on six benchmark data sets demonstrate the advantageous performance of this approach over representative baselines in both kernel approximation and supervised learning tasks."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/207	Wei-Cheng Chang, Chun-Liang Li, Yiming Yang, Barnabás Póczos
Encoding and Recall of Spatio-Temporal Episodic Memory in Real Time	Episodic memory enables a cognitive system to improve its performance by reflecting upon past events. In this paper, we propose a computational model called STEM for encoding and recall of episodic events together with the associated contextual information in real time. Based on a class of self-organizing neural networks, STEM is designed to learn memory chunks or cognitive nodes, each encoding a set of co-occurring multi-modal activity patterns across multiple pattern channels. We present algorithms for recall of events based on partial and inexact input patterns. Our empirical results based on a public domain data set show that STEM displays a high level of efficiency and robustness in encoding and retrieval with both partial and noisy search cues when compared with a state-of-the-art associative memory model.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/206	Poo-Hee Chang, Ah-Hwee Tan
Multiple-Weight Recurrent Neural Networks	Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have enjoyed great success in speech recognition, natural language processing, etc. Many variants of RNNs have been proposed, including vanilla RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs. However, current architectures are not particularly adept at dealing with tasks involving multi-faceted contents. In this work, we solve this problem by proposing Multiple-Weight RNNs and LSTMs, which rely on multiple weight matrices in an attempt to mimic the human ability of switching between contexts. We present a framework for adapting RNN-based models and analyze the properties of this approach. Our detailed experimental results show that our model outperforms previous work across a range of different tasks and datasets.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/205	Zhu Cao, Linlin Wang, Gerard de Melo
SPMC: Socially-Aware Personalized Markov Chains for Sparse Sequential Recommendation	Dealing with sparse, long-tailed datasets, and cold-start problems is always a challenge for recommender systems. These issues can partly be dealt with by making predictions not in isolation, but by leveraging information from related events; such information could include signals from social relationships or from the sequence of recent activities. Both types of additional information can be used to improve the performance of state-of-the-art matrix factorization-based techniques. In this paper, we propose new methods to combine both social and sequential information simultaneously, in order to further improve recommendation performance. We show these techniques to be particularly effective when dealing with sparsity and cold-start issues in several large, real-world datasets.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/204	Chenwei Cai, Ruining He, Julian McAuley
Context Attentive Bandits: Contextual Bandit with Restricted Context	We consider a novel formulation of the multi-armed bandit model, which we call the contextual bandit with restricted context, where only a limited number of features can be accessed by the learner at every iteration. This novel formulation is motivated by different online problems arising in clinical trials, recommender systems and attention modeling.Herein, we adapt the standard multi-armed bandit algorithm known as Thompson Sampling to take advantage of our restricted context setting, and propose two novel algorithms, called the Thompson Sampling with Restricted Context (TSRC) and the Windows Thompson Sampling with Restricted Context (WTSRC), for handling stationary and nonstationary environments, respectively. Our empirical results demonstrate advantages of the proposed approaches on several real-life datasets.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/203	Djallel Bouneffouf, Irina Rish, Guillermo Cecchi, Raphaël Féraud
Human-Centric Justification of Machine Learning Predictions	Human decision makers in many domains can make use of predictions made by machine learning models in their decision making process, but the usability of these predictions is limited if the human is unable to justify his or her trust in the prediction. We propose a novel approach to producing justifications that is geared towards users without machine learning expertise, focusing on domain knowledge and on human reasoning, and utilizing natural language generation. Through a task-based experiment, we show that our approach significantly helps humans to correctly decide whether or not predictions are accurate, and significantly increases their satisfaction with the justification.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/202	Or Biran, Kathleen McKeown
Using Graphs of Classifiers to Impose Declarative Constraints on Semi-supervised Learning	We propose a general approach to modeling semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms. Specifically, we present a declarative language for modeling both traditional supervised classification tasks and many SSL heuristics, including both well-known heuristics such as co-training and novel domain-specific heuristics. In addition to representing individual SSL heuristics, we show that multiple heuristics can be automatically combined using Bayesian optimization methods. We experiment with two classes of tasks, link-based text classification and relation extraction. We show modest improvements on well-studied link-based classification benchmarks, and state-of-the-art results on relation-extraction tasks for two realistic domains.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/201	Lidong Bing, William W.

Unsupervised Learning of Deep Feature Representation for Clustering Egocentric Actions	Popularity of wearable cameras in life logging, law enforcement, assistive vision and other similar applications is leading to explosion in generation of egocentric video content. First person action recognition is an important aspect of automatic analysis of such videos. Annotating such videos is hard, not only because of obvious scalability constraints, but also because of privacy issues often associated with egocentric videos. This motivates the use of unsupervised methods for egocentric video analysis. In this work, we propose a robust and generic unsupervised approach for first person action clustering. Unlike the contemporary approaches, our technique is neither limited to any particular class of actions nor requires priors such as pre-training, fine-tuning, etc. We learn time sequenced visual and flow features from an array of weak feature extractors based on convolutional and LSTM autoencoder networks. We demonstrate that clustering of such features leads to the discovery of semantically meaningful actions present in the video. We validate our approach on four disparate public egocentric actions datasets amounting to approximately 50 hours of videos. We show that our approach surpasses the supervised state of the art accuracies without using the action labels.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/200	Bharat Lal Bhatnagar, Suriya Singh, Chetan Arora, C.V.

AccGenSVM: Selectively Transferring from Previous Hypotheses	In our research, we consider transfer learning scenarios where a target learner does not have access to the source data, but instead to hypotheses or models induced from it. This is called the Hypothesis Transfer Learning (HTL) problem. Previous approaches concentrated on transferring source hypotheses as a whole. We introduce a novel method for selectively transferring elements from previous hypotheses learned with Support Vector Machines. The representation of an SVM hypothesis as a set of support vectors allows us to treat this information as privileged to aid learning during a new task. Given a possibly large number of source hypotheses, our approach selects the source support vectors that more closely resemble the target data, and transfers their learned coefficients as constraints on the coefficients to be learned. This strategy increases the importance of relevant target data points based on their similarity to source support vectors, while learning from the target data. Our method shows important improvements on the convergence rate on three classification datasets of varying sizes, decreasing the number of iterations by up to 56% on average compared to learning with no transfer and up to 92% compared to regular HTL, while maintaining similar accuracy levels.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/199	Diana Benavides-Prado, Yun Sing Koh, Patricia Riddle
Handling Noise in Boolean Matrix Factorization	We critically examine and point out weaknesses of the existing considerations in Boolean matrix factorization (BMF) regarding noise and the algorithms' ability to deal with noise. We argue that the current understanding is underdeveloped and that the current approaches are missing an important aspect. We provide a new, quantitative way to assess the ability of an algorithm to handle noise. Our approach is based on a common-sense definition of robustness requiring that the computed factorizations should not be affected much by varying the noise in data. We present an experimental evaluation of several existing algorithms and compare the results to the observations available in the literature. In addition to providing justification of some properties claimed in the literature without proper justification, our experiments reveal properties which were not reported as well as properties which counter certain claims made in the literature. Importantly, our approach reveals a line separating robust-to-noise from sensitive-to-noise algorithms, which has not been revealed by the previous approaches.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/198	Radim Belohlavek, Martin Trnecka
Mining Convex Polygon Patterns with Formal Concept Analysis	Pattern mining is an important task in AI for eliciting hypotheses from the data. When it comes to spatial data, the geo-coordinates are often considered independently as two different attributes. Consequently, rectangular patterns are searched for. Such an arbitrary form is not able to capture interesting regions in general. We thus introduce convex polygons, a good trade-off for capturing high density areas in any pattern mining task. Our contribution is threefold: (i) We formally introduce such patterns in Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), (ii) we give all the basic bricks for mining polygons with exhaustive search and pattern sampling, and (iii) we design several algorithms that we compare experimentally.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/197	Aimene Belfodil, Sergei O.

Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Hierarchies of Machines by Leveraging Internal Transitions	In the context of hierarchical reinforcement learning, the idea of hierarchies of abstract machines (HAMs) is to write a partial policy as a set of hierarchical finite state machines with unspecified choice states, and use reinforcement learning to learn an optimal completion of this partial policy. Given a HAM with potentially deep hierarchical structure, there often exist many internal transitions where a machine calls another machine with the environment state unchanged. In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm that discovers such internal transitions automatically, and shortcircuits them recursively in computation of Q values. The resulting HAMQ-INT algorithm outperforms the state of the art significantly on the benchmark Taxi domain and a much more complex RoboCup Keepaway domain.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/196	Aijun Bai, Stuart Russell
Bayesian Aggregation of Categorical Distributions with Applications in Crowdsourcing	A key problem in crowdsourcing is the aggregation of judgments of proportions. For example, workers might be presented with a news article or an image, and be asked to identify the proportion of each topic, sentiment, object, or colour present in it. These varying judgments then need to be aggregated to form a consensus view of the document's or image's contents. Often, however, these judgments are skewed by workers who provide judgments randomly. Such spammers make the cost of acquiring judgments more expensive and degrade the accuracy of the aggregation. For such cases, we provide a new Bayesian framework for aggregating these responses (expressed in the form of categorical distributions) that for the first time accounts for spammers. We elicit 796 judgments about proportions of objects and coloursin images. Experimental results show comparable aggregation accuracy when 60% of the workers are spammers, as other state of the art approaches do when there are no spammers.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/195	Alexandry Augustin, Matteo Venanzi, Alex Rogers, Nicholas R.

Universal Reinforcement Learning Algorithms: Survey and Experiments	Many state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically assume that the environment is an ergodic Markov Decision Process (MDP). In contrast, the field of universal reinforcement learning (URL) is concerned with algorithms that make as few assumptions as possible about the environment. The universal Bayesian agent AIXI and a family of related URL algorithms have been developed in this setting. While numerous theoretical optimality results have been proven for these agents, there has been no empirical investigation of their behavior to date. We present a short and accessible survey of these URL algorithms under a unified notation and framework, along with results of some experiments that qualitatively illustrate some properties of the resulting policies, and their relative performance on partially-observable gridworld environments. We also present an open- source reference implementation of the algorithms which we hope will facilitate further understanding of, and experimentation with, these ideas.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/194	John Aslanides, Jan Leike, Marcus Hutter
Grounding of Human Environments and Activities for Autonomous Robots	With the recent proliferation of human-oriented robotic applications in domestic and industrial scenarios, it is vital for robots to continually learn about their environments and about the humans they share their environments with. In this paper, we present a novel, online, incremental framework for unsupervised symbol grounding in real-world, human environments for autonomous robots. We demonstrate the flexibility of the framework by learning about colours, people names, usable objects and simple human activities, integrating state-of-the-art object segmentation, pose estimation, activity analysis along with a number of sensory input encodings into a continual learning framework. Natural language is grounded to the learned concepts, enabling the robot to communicate in a human-understandable way. We show, using a challenging real-world dataset of human activities as perceived by a mobile robot, that our framework is able to extract useful concepts, ground natural language descriptions to them, and, as a proof-of-concept, generate simple sentences from templates to describe people and the activities they are engaged in.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/193	Muhannad  Alomari, Paul Duckworth, Nils Bore, Majd Hawasly, David C.

RHash: Robust Hashing via L_infinity-norm Distortion	Hashing is an important tool in large-scale machine learning. Unfortunately, current data-dependent hashing algorithms are not robust to small perturbations of the data points, which degrades the performance of nearest neighbor (NN) search. The culprit is the minimization of the L_2-norm, average distortion among pairs of points to find the hash function. Inspired by recent progress in robust optimization, we develop a novel hashing algorithm, dubbed RHash, that instead minimizes the L_1-norm, worst-case distortion among pairs of points. We develop practical and efficient implementations of RHash that couple the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework with column generation to scale well to large datasets. A range of experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of RHash over ten state-of-the-art binary hashing schemes. In particular, we show that RHash achieves the same retrieval performance as the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of average precision while using up to 60% fewer bits.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/192	Amirali Aghazadeh, Andrew Lan, Anshumali Shrivastava, Richard Baraniuk
Contextual Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategies	Many stochastic search algorithms are designed to optimize a fixed objective function to learn a task, i.e., if the objective function changes slightly, for example, due to a change in the situation or context of the task, relearning is required to adapt to the new context. For instance, if we want to learn a kicking movement for a soccer robot, we have to relearn the movement for different ball locations. Such relearning is undesired as it is highly inefficient and many applications require a fast adaptation to a new context/situation. Therefore, we investigate contextual stochastic search algorithms that can learn multiple, similar tasks simultaneously. Current contextual stochastic search methods are based on policy search algorithms and suffer from premature convergence and the need for parameter tuning. In this paper, we extend the well known CMA-ES algorithm to the contextual setting and illustrate its performance on several contextual tasks. Our new algorithm, called contextual CMA-ES, leverages from contextual learning while it preserves all the features of standard CMA-ES such as stability, avoidance of premature convergence, step size control and a minimal amount of parameter tuning.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/191	Abbas Abdolmaleki, Bob Price, Nuno Lau, Luis Paulo Reis, Gerhard Neumann
A Unifying Framework for Probabilistic Belief Revision	"In this paper we provide a general, unifying framework for probabilistic belief revision. We first introduce a probabilistic logic called p-logic that is capable of representing and reasoning with basic probabilistic information. With p-logic as the background logic, we define a revision function called p-revision that resembles partial meet revision in the AGM framework. We provide a representation theorem for p-revision which shows that it can be characterised by the set of basic AGM revision postulates. P-revision represents an ""all purpose"" method for revising probabilistic information that can be used for, but not limited to, the revision problems behind Bayesian conditionalisation, Jeffrey conditionalisation, and Lewis's imaging. Importantly, p-revision subsumes all three approaches indicating that Bayesian conditionalisation, Jeffrey conditionalisation, and Lewis' imaging all obey the basic principles of AGM revision. As well our investigation sheds light on the corresponding operation of AGM expansion in the probabilistic setting."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/190	Zhiqiang Zhuang, James Delgrande, Abhaya Nayak, Abdul Sattar
Symbolic LTLf Synthesis	LTLf synthesis is the process of finding a strategy that satisfies a linear temporal specification over finite traces. An existing solution to this problem relies on a reduction to a DFA game. In this paper, we propose a symbolic framework for LTLf synthesis based on this technique, by performing the computation over a representation of the DFA as a boolean formula rather than as an explicit graph. This approach enables strategy generation by utilizing the mechanism of boolean synthesis. We implement this symbolic synthesis method in a tool called Syft, and demonstrate by experiments on scalable benchmarks that the symbolic approach scales better than the explicit one.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/189	Shufang Zhu, Lucas M.

Role Forgetting for ALCOQH(universal role)-Ontologies Using an Ackermann-Based Approach	Forgetting refers to a non-standard reasoning problem concerned with eliminating concept and role symbols from description logic-based ontologies while preserving all logical consequences up to the remaining symbols. Whereas previous research has primarily focused on forgetting concept symbols, in this paper, we turn our attention to role symbol forgetting. In particular, we present a practical method for semantic role forgetting for ontologies expressible in the description logic ALCOQH(universal role), i.e., the basic description logic ALC extended with nominals, qualified number restrictions, role inclusions and the universal role. Being based on an Ackermann approach, the method is the only approach so far for forgetting role symbols in description logics with qualified number restrictions. The method is goal-oriented and incremental. It always terminates and is sound in the sense that the forgetting solution is equivalent to the original ontology up to the forgotten symbols possibly with new concept definer symbols. Despite our method not being complete, performance results of an evaluation with a prototypical implementation have shown very good success rates on real-world ontologies.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/188	Yizheng Zhao, Renate A.

Causal Discovery from Nonstationary/Heterogeneous Data: Skeleton Estimation and Orientation Determination	It is commonplace to encounter nonstationary or heterogeneous data, of which the underlying generating process changes over time or across data sets (the data sets may have different experimental conditions or data collection conditions). Such a distribution shift feature presents both challenges and opportunities for causal discovery. In this paper we develop a principled framework for causal discovery from such data, called Constraint-based causal Discovery from Nonstationary/heterogeneous Data (CD-NOD), which addresses two important questions. First, we propose an enhanced constraint-based procedure to detect variables whose local mechanisms change and recover the skeleton of the causal structure over observed variables. Second, we present a way to determine causal orientations by making use of independence changes in the data distribution implied by the underlying causal model, benefiting from information carried by changing distributions. Experimental results on various synthetic and real-world data sets are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of our methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/187	Kun Zhang, Biwei Huang, Jiji Zhang, Clark Glymour, Bernhard Schölkopf
Transfer Learning in Multi-Armed Bandits: A Causal Approach	Reinforcement learning (RL) agents have been deployed in complex environments where interactions are costly, and learning is usually slow. One prominent task in these settings is to reuse interactions performed by other agents to accelerate the learning process. Causal inference provides a family of methods to infer the effects of actions from a combination of data and qualitative assumptions about the underlying environment. Despite its success of transferring invariant knowledge across domains in the empirical sciences, causal inference has not been fully realized in the context of transfer learning in interactive domains. In this paper, we use causal inference as a basis to support a principled and more robust transfer of knowledge in RL settings. In particular, we tackle the problem of transferring knowledge across bandit agents in settings where causal effects cannot be identified by do-calculus [Pearl, 2000] and standard learning techniques. Our new identification strategy combines two steps -- first, deriving bounds over the arm's distribution based on structural knowledge; second, incorporating these bounds in a dynamic allocation procedure so as to guide the search towards more promising actions. We formally prove that our strategy dominates previously known algorithms and achieves orders of magnitude faster convergence rates than these algorithms. Finally, we perform simulations and empirically demonstrate that our strategy is consistently more efficient than the current (non-causal) state-of-the-art methods	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/186	Junzhe Zhang, Elias Bareinboim
Proposing a Highly Accurate Hybrid Component-Based Factorised Preference Model in Recommender Systems	Recommender systems play an important role in today's electronic markets due to the large benefits they bring by helping businesses understand their customers' needs and preferences. The major preference components modelled by current recommender systems include user and item biases, feature value preferences, conditional dependencies, temporal preference drifts, and social influence on preferences. In this paper, we introduce a new hybrid latent factor model that achieves great accuracy by integrating all these preference components in a unified model efficiently. The proposed model employs gradient descent to optimise the model parameters, and an evolutionary algorithm to optimise the hyper-parameters and gradient descent learning rates. Using two popular datasets, we investigate the interaction effects of the preference components with each other.We conclude that depending on the dataset, different interactions exist between the preference components. Therefore, understanding these interaction effects is crucial in designing an accurate preference model in every preference dataset and domain.Our results show that on both datasets, different combinations of components result in different accuracies of recommendation, suggesting that some parts of the model interact strongly. Moreover, these effects are highly dataset-dependent, suggesting the need for exploring these effects before choosing the appropriate combination of components.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/185	Farhad Zafari, Rasoul Rahmani, Irene Moser
Aggregating Crowd Wisdoms with Label-aware Autoencoders	Aggregating crowd wisdoms takes multiple labels from various sources and infers true labels for objects. Recent research work makes progress by learning source credibility from data and roughly form three kinds of modeling frameworks: weighted majority voting, trust propagation, and generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Label-Aware Autoencoders (LAA) to aggregate crowd wisdoms. LAA integrates a classifier and a reconstructor into a unified model to infer labels in an unsupervised manner. Analogizing classical autoencoders, we can regard the classifier as an encoder, the reconstructor as a decoder, and inferred labels as latent features. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first trial to combine label aggregation with autoencoders. We adopt networks to implement the classifier and the reconstructor which have the potential to automatically learn underlying patterns of source credibility. To further improve inference accuracy, we introduce object ambiguity and latent aspects into LAA. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that proposed models achieve impressive inference accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art models.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/184	Li'ang Yin, Jianhua Han, Weinan Zhang, Yong Yu
Knowledge Graph Representation with Jointly Structural and Textual Encoding	The objective of knowledge graph embedding is to encode both entities and relations of knowledge graphs into continuous low-dimensional vector spaces. Previously, most works focused on symbolic representation of knowledge graph with structure information, which can not handle new entities or entities with few facts well. In this paper, we propose a novel deep architecture to utilize both structural and textual information of entities. Specifically, we introduce three neural models to encode the valuable information from text description of entity, among which an attentive model can select related information as needed. Then, a gating mechanism is applied to integrate representations of structure and text into a unified architecture. Experiments show that our models outperform baseline and obtain state-of-the-art results on link prediction and triplet classification tasks.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/183	Jiacheng Xu, Xipeng Qiu, Kan Chen, Xuanjing Huang
Efficient Inference and Computation of Optimal Alternatives for Preference Languages Based On Lexicographic Models	We analyse preference inference, through consistency, for general preference languages based on lexicographic models. We identify a property, which we call strong compositionality, that applies for many natural kinds of preference statement, and that allows a greedy algorithm for determining consistency of a set of preference statements. We also consider different natural definitions of optimality, and their relations to each other, for general preference languages based on lexicographic models. Based on our framework, we show that testing consistency, and thus inference, is polynomial for a specific preference language which allows strict and non-strict statements, comparisons between outcomes and between partial tuples, both ceteris paribus and strong statements, and their combination. Computing different kinds of optimal sets is also shown to be polynomial; this is backed up by our experimental results.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/182	Nic Wilson, Anne-Marie George
A Characterization Theorem for a Modal Description Logic	Modal description logics feature modalities that capture dependence of knowledge on parameters such as time, place, or the information state of agents. E.g., the logic S5-ALC combines the standard description logic ALC with an S5-modality that can be understood as an epistemic operator or as representing (undirected) change. This logic embeds into a corresponding modal first-order logic S5-FOL. We prove a modal characterization theorem for this embedding, in analogy to results by van Benthem and Rosen relating ALC to standard first-order logic: We show that S5-ALC with only local roles is, both over finite and over unrestricted models, precisely the bisimulation-invariant fragment of S5-FOL, thus giving an exact description of the expressive power of S5-ALC with only local roles.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/181	Paul Wild, Lutz Schröder
Inferring Human Attention by Learning Latent Intentions	This paper addresses the problem of inferring 3D human attention in RGB-D videos at scene scale. 3D human attention describes where a human is looking in 3D scenes. We propose a probabilistic method to jointly model attention, intentions, and their interactions. Latent intentions guide human attention which conversely reveals the intention features. This mutual interaction makes attention inference a joint optimization with latent intentions. An EM-based approach is adopted to learn the latent intentions and model parameters. Given an RGB-D video with 3D human skeletons, a joint-state dynamic programming algorithm is utilized to jointly infer the latent intentions, the 3D attention directions, and the attention voxels in scene point clouds. Experiments on a new 3D human attention dataset prove the strength of our method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/180	Ping Wei, Dan Xie, Nanning Zheng, Song-Chun Zhu
Explicit Knowledge-based Reasoning for Visual Question Answering	We describe a method for visual question answering which is capable of reasoning about an image on the basis of information extracted from a large-scale knowledge base. The method not only answers natural language questions using concepts not contained in the image, but can explain the reasoning by which it developed its answer. It is capable of answering far more complex questions than the predominant long short-term memory-based approach, and outperforms it significantly in testing. We also provide a dataset and a protocol by which to evaluate general visual question answering methods.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/179	Peng Wang, Qi Wu, Chunhua Shen, Anthony Dick, Anton van den Hengel
How a General-Purpose Commonsense Ontology can Improve Performance of Learning-Based Image Retrieval	"The knowledge representation community has built general-purpose ontologies which contain large amounts of commonsense knowledge over relevant aspects of the world, including useful visual information, e.g.: ""a ball is used by a football player"", ""a tennis player is located at a tennis court"". Current state-of-the-art approaches for visual recognition do not exploit these rule-based knowledge sources. Instead, they learn recognition models directly from training examples. In this paper, we study how general-purpose ontologies—specifically, MIT's ConceptNet ontology—can improve the performance of state-of-the-art vision systems. As a testbed, we tackle the problem of sentence-based image retrieval. Our retrieval approach incorporates knowledge from ConceptNet on top of a large pool of object detectors derived from a deep learning technique. In our experiments, we show that ConceptNet can improve performance on a common benchmark dataset. Key to our performance is the use of the ESPGAME dataset to select visually relevant relations from ConceptNet. Consequently, a main conclusion of this work is that general-purpose commonsense ontologies improve performance on visual reasoning tasks when properly filtered to select meaningful visual relations."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/178	Rodrigo Toro Icarte, Jorge A.

GDL-III: A Description Language for Epistemic General Game Playing	GDL-III, a description language for general game playing with imperfect information and introspection, supports the specification of epistemic games. These are characterised by rules that depend on the knowledge of players. GDL-III provides a simpler language for representing actions and knowledge than existing formalisms: domain descriptions require neither explicit axioms about the epistemic effects of actions, nor explicit specifications of accessibility relations. We develop a formal semantics for GDL-III and demonstrate that this language, despite its syntactic simplicity, is expressive enough to model the famous Muddy Children domain. We also show that it significantly enhances the expressiveness of its predecessor GDL-II by formally proving that termination of games becomes undecidable, and we present experimental results with a reasoner for GDL-III applied to general epistemic puzzles.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/177	Michael Thielscher
On Computing World Views of Epistemic Logic Programs	This paper presents a novel algorithm for computing world views of different semantics of epistemic logic programs (ELP) and two of its realization, called Ep-asp (for an older semantics) and Ep-asp^{se} (for the newest semantics), whose implementation builds on the theoretical advancement in the study of ELPs and takes advantage of the multi-shot computation paradigm of the answer set solver Clingo. The new algorithm differs from the majority of earlier algorithms in its strategy. Specifically, it computes one world view at a time and utilizes properties of world views to reduce its search space. It starts by computing an answer set and then determines whether or not a world view containing this answer set exists. In addition, it allows for the computation to focus on world views satisfying certain properties. The paper includes an experimental analysis of the performance of the two solvers comparing against a recently developed solver. It also contains an analysis of their performance in goal directed computing against a logic programming based conformant planning system, dlv-k. It concludes with some final remarks and discussion on the future work.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/176	Tran Cao Son, Tiep Le, Patrick Kahl, Anthony Leclerc
Efficiently Enforcing Path Consistency on Qualitative Constraint Networks by Use of Abstraction	Partial closure under weak composition, or partial weak path-consistency for short, is essential for tackling fundamental reasoning problems associated with qualitative constraint networks, such as the satisfiability checking problem, and therefore it is crucial to be able to enforce it as fast as possible. To this end, we propose a new algorithm, called PWCα, for efficiently enforcing partial weak path-consistency on qualitative constraint networks, that exploits the notion of abstraction for qualitative constraint networks, utilizes certain properties of partial weak path-consistency,and adapts the functionalities of some state-of-the-art algorithms to its design. It is worth noting that, as opposed to a related approach in the recent literature, algorithm PWCα is complete for arbitrary qualitative constraint networks. The evaluation that we conducted with qualitative constraint networks of the Region Connection Calculus against a competing state-of-the-art generic algorithm for enforcing partial weak path-consistency, demonstrates the usefulness and efficiency of algorithm PWCα.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/175	Michael Sioutis, Jean-François Condotta
Fair Allocation based on Diminishing Differences	Ranking alternatives is a natural way for humans to explain their preferences. It is being used in many settings, such as school choice (NY, Boston), Course allocations, and the Israeli medical lottery. In some cases (such as the latter two), several ``items'' are given to each participant. Without having any information on the underlying cardinal utilities, arguing about fairness of allocation requires extending the ordinal item ranking to ordinal bundle ranking. The most commonly used such extension is stochastic dominance (SD), where a bundle X is preferred over a bundle Y if its score is better according to all additive score functions. SD is a very conservative extension, by which few allocations are necessarily fair while many allocations are possibly fair. We propose to make a natural assumption on the underlying cardinal utilities of the players, namely that the difference between two items at the top is larger than the difference between two items at the bottom. This assumption implies a preference extension which we call diminishing differences (DD), where a X is preferred over Y if its score is better according to all additive score functions satisfying the DD assumption. We give a full characterization of allocations that are necessarily-proportional or possibly-proportional according to this assumption. Based on this characterization, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a necessarily-DD-proportional allocation if it exists. Using simulations, we show that with high probability, a necessarily-proportional allocation does not exist but a necessarily-DD-proportional allocation exists, and moreover, that allocation is proportional according to the underlying cardinal utilities.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/174	Erel Segal-Halevi, Haris Aziz, Avinatan Hassidim
A Reasoning System for a First-Order Logic of Limited Belief	Logics of limited belief aim at enabling computationally feasible reasoning in highly expressive representation languages. These languages are often dialects of first-order logic with a weaker form of logical entailment that keeps reasoning decidable or even tractable. While a number of such logics have been proposed in the past, they tend to remain for theoretical analysis only and their practical relevance is very limited. In this paper, we aim to go beyond the theory. Building on earlier work by Liu, Lakemeyer, and Levesque, we develop a logic of limited belief that is highly expressive but remains decidable in the first-order and tractable in the propositional case and exhibits some characteristics that make it attractive for an implementation. We introduce a reasoning system that employs this logic as representation language and present experimental results that showcase the benefit of limited belief.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/173	Christoph Schwering
Conflict-driven ASP Solving with External Sources and Program Splits	Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a well-known problem solving approach based on nonmonotonic reasoning. HEX-programs extend ASP with external atoms for access to arbitrary external sources, which can also introduce constants that do not appear in the program (value invention). In order to determine the relevant constants during (pre-)grounding, external atoms must in general be evaluated under up to exponentially many possible inputs. While program splitting techniques allow for eliminating exhaustive pre-grounding, they prohibit effective conflict-driven solving. Thus, current techniques suffer either a grounding or a solving bottleneck. In this work we introduce a new technique for conflict-driven learning over multiple program components. To this end, we identify reasons for inconsistency of program components wrt. input from predecessor components and propagate them back. Experiments show a significant, potentially exponential speedup.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/172	Christoph Redl
Efficient and Complete FD-solving for extended array constraints	Array constraints are essential for handling data structures in automated reasoning and software verification. Unfortunately, the use of a typical finite domain (FD) solver based on local consistency-based filtering has strong limitations when constraints on indexes are combined with constraints on array elements and size. This paper proposes an efficient and complete FD-solving technique for extended constraints over (possibly unbounded) arrays. We describe a simple but particularly powerful transformation for building an equisatisfiable formula that can be efficiently solved using standard FD reasoning over arrays, even in the unbounded case. Experiments show that the proposed solver significantly outperforms FD solvers, and successfully competes with the best SMT-solvers.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/171	Quentin Plazar, Mathieu Acher, Sébastien Bardin, Arnaud Gotlieb
The Bag Semantics of Ontology-Based Data Access	Ontology-based data access (OBDA) is a popular approach for integrating and querying multiple data sources by means of a shared ontology. The ontology is linked to the sources using mappings, which assign views over the data to ontology predicates. Motivated by the need for OBDA systems supporting database-style aggregate queries, we propose a bag semantics for OBDA, where duplicate tuples in the views defined by the mappings are retained, as is the case in standard databases. We show that bag semantics makes conjunctive query answering in OBDA coNP-hard in data complexity. To regain tractability, we consider a rather general class of queries and show its rewritability to a generalisation of the relational calculus to bags.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/170	Charalampos Nikolaou, Egor V.

Generalized Target Assignment and Path Finding Using Answer Set Programming	In Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), a team of agents needs to find collision-free paths from their starting locations to their respective targets. Combined Target Assignment and Path Finding (TAPF) extends MAPF by including the problem of assigning targets to agents as a precursor to the MAPF problem. A limitation of both models is their assumption that the number of agents and targets are equal, which is invalid in some applications such as autonomous warehouse systems. We address this limitation by generalizing TAPF to allow for (1)~unequal number of agents and tasks; (2)~tasks to have deadlines by which they must be completed; (3)~ordering of groups of tasks to be completed; and (4)~tasks that are composed of a sequence of checkpoints that must be visited in a specific order. Further, we model the problem using answer set programming (ASP) to show that customizing the desired variant of the problem is simple one only needs to choose the appropriate combination of ASP rules to enforce it. We also demonstrate experimentally that if problem specific information can be incorporated into the ASP encoding then ASP based method can be efficient and can scale up to solve practical applications.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/169	Van  Nguyen, Philipp   Obermeier, Tran Cao Son, Torsten Schaub, William Yeoh
Dominance and Optimisation Based on Scale-Invariant Maximum Margin Preference Learning	In the task of preference learning, there can be natural invariance properties that one might often expect a method to satisfy. These include (i) invariance to scaling of a pair of alternatives, e.g., replacing a pair (a,b) by (2a,2b); and (ii) invariance to rescaling of features across all alternatives. Maximum margin learning approaches satisfy such invariance properties for pairs of test vectors, but not for the preference input pairs, i.e., scaling the inputs in a different way could result in a different preference relation. In this paper we define and analyse more cautious preference relations that are invariant to the scaling of features, or inputs, or both simultaneously; this leads to computational methods for testing dominance with respect to the induced relations, and for generating optimal solutions among a set of alternatives. In our experiments, we compare the relations and their associated optimality sets based on their decisiveness, computation time and cardinality of the optimal set. We also discuss connections with imprecise probability.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/168	Mojtaba Montazery, Nic Wilson
Contract Design for Energy Demand Response	Power companies such as Southern California Edison (SCE) uses Demand Response (DR) contracts to incentivize consumers to reduce their power consumption during periods when demand forecast exceeds supply. Current mechanisms in use offer contracts to consumers independent of one another, do not take into consideration consumers' heterogeneity in consumption profile or reliability, and fail to achieve high participation. We introduce DR-VCG, a new DR mechanism that offers a flexible set of contracts (which may include the standard SCE contracts) and uses VCG pricing. We prove that DR-VCG elicits truthful bids, incentivizes honest preparation efforts, and enables efficient computation of allocation and prices. With simple fixed-penalty contracts, the optimization goal of the mechanism is an upper bound on probability that the reduction target is missed. Extensive simulations show that compared to the current mechanism deployed by SCE, the DR-VCG mechanism achieves higher participation, increased reliability, and significantly reduced total expenses.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/167	Reshef Meir, Hongyao Ma, Valentin Robu
Context-aware Path Ranking for Knowledge Base Completion	Knowledge base (KB) completion aims to infer missing facts from existing ones in a KB. Among various approaches, path ranking (PR) algorithms have received increasing attention in recent years. PR algorithms enumerate paths between entity-pairs in a KB and use those paths as features to train a model for missing fact prediction. Due to their good performances and high model interpretability, several methods have been proposed. However, most existing methods suffer from scalability (high RAM consumption) and feature explosion (trains on an exponentially large number of features) problems. This paper proposes a Context-aware Path Ranking (C-PR) algorithm to solve these problems by introducing a selective path exploration strategy. C-PR learns global semantics of entities in the KB using word embedding and leverages the knowledge of entity semantics to enumerate contextually relevant paths using bidirectional random walk. Experimental results on three large KBs show that the path features (fewer in number) discovered by C-PR not only improve predictive performance but also are more interpretable than existing baselines.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/166	Sahisnu Mazumder, Bing Liu
Logic on MARS: Ontologies for Generalised Property Graphs	Graph-structured data is used to represent large information collections, called knowledge graphs, in many applications. Their exact format may vary, but they often share the concept that edges can be annotated with additional information, such as validity time or provenance information. Property Graph is a popular graph database format that also provides this feature. We give a formalisation of a generalised notion of Property Graphs, called multi-attributed relational structures (MARS), and introduce a matching knowledge representation formalism, multi-attributed predicate logic (MAPL). We analyse the expressive power of MAPL and suggest a simpler, rule-based fragment of MAPL that can be used for ontological reasoning on Property Graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to making Property Graphs and related data structures accessible to symbolic AI.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/165	Maximilian Marx, Markus Krötzsch, Veronika Thost
Ontology-Mediated Querying with the Description Logic EL: Trichotomy and Linear Datalog Rewritability	We consider ontology-mediated queries (OMQs) based on an EL ontology and an atomic query (AQ), provide an ultimately fine-grained analysis of data complexity and study rewritability into linear Datalog-aiming to capture linear recursion in SQL. Our main results are that every such OMQ is in AC0, NL-complete or PTime-complete, and that containment in NL coincides with rewritability into linear Datalog (whereas containment in AC0 coincides with rewritability into first-order logic). We establish natural characterizations of the three cases, show that deciding linear Datalog rewritability (as well as the mentioned complexities) is ExpTime-complete, give a way to construct linear Datalog rewritings when they exist, and prove that there is no constant bound on the arity of IDB relations in linear Datalog rewritings.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/164	Carsten Lutz, Leif Sabellek
A Data-Driven Approach to Infer Knowledge Base Representation for Natural Language Relations	This paper studies the problem of discovering the structured knowledge representation of binary natural language relations.The representation, known as the schema, generalizes the traditional path of predicates to support more complex semantics.We present a search algorithm to generate schemas over a knowledge base, and propose a data-driven learning approach to discover the most suitable representations to one relation. Evaluation results show that inferred schemas are able to represent precise semantics, and can be used to enrich manually crafted knowledge bases.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/163	Kangqi Luo, Xusheng Luo, Xianyang Chen, Kenny Q.

Temporalising Separation Logic for Planning with Search Control Knowledge	Temporal logics are widely adopted in Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning for specifying Search Control Knowledge (SCK). However, traditional temporal logics are limited in expressive power since they are unable to express spatial constraints which are as important as temporal ones in many planning domains. To this end, we propose a two-dimensional (spatial and temporal) logic namely PPTL^SL by temporalising separation logic with Propositional Projection Temporal Logic (PPTL). The new logic is well-suited for specifying SCK containing both spatial and temporal constraints which are useful in AI planning. We show that PPTL^SL is decidable and present a decision procedure. With this basis, a planner namely S-TSolver for computing plans based on the spatio-temporal SCK expressed in PPTL^SL formulas is developed. Evaluation on some selected benchmark domains shows the effectiveness of S-TSolver.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/162	Xu Lu, Cong Tian, Zhenhua Duan
Mapping Repair in Ontology-based Data Access Evolving Systems	In this paper we study the evolution of ontology-based data access (OBDA) specifications, and focus on the case in which the ontology and/or the data source schema change, which may require a modification to the mapping between them to preserve both consistency and knowledge. Our approach is based on the idea of repairing the mapping according to the usual principle of minimal change and on a recent, mapping-based notion of consistency of the specification. We define and analyze two notions of mapping repair under ontology and source schema update. We then present a set of results on the complexity of query answering in the above framework, when the ontology is expressed in DL-LiteR.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/161	Domenico Lembo, Riccardo Rosati, Valerio Santarelli, Domenico Fabio Savo, Evgenij Thorstensen
Induction of Interpretable Possibilistic Logic Theories from Relational Data	The field of statistical relational learning (SRL) is concerned with learning probabilistic models from relational data. Learned SRL models are typically represented using some kind of weighted logical formulas, which makes them considerably more interpretable than those obtained by e.g. neural networks. In practice, however, these models are often still difficult to interpret correctly, as they can contain many formulas that interact in non-trivial ways and weights do not always have an intuitive meaning. To address this, we propose a new SRL method which uses possibilistic logic to encode relational models. Learned models are then essentially stratified classical theories, which explicitly encode what can be derived with a given level of certainty. Compared to Markov Logic Networks (MLNs), our method is faster and produces considerably more interpretable models.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/160	Ondrej Kuzelka, Jesse Davis, Steven Schockaert
On the Complexity of Enumerating the Extensions of Abstract Argumentation Frameworks	Several computational problems of abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs) such as skeptical and credulous reasoning, existence of a non-empty extension, verification, etc. have been thoroughly analyzed for various semantics. In contrast, the enumeration problem of AFs (i.e., the problem of computing all extensions according to some semantics) has been left unexplored so far. The goal of this paper is to fill this gap. We thus investigate the enumeration complexity of AFs for a large collection of semantics and, in addition, consider the most common structural restrictions on AFs.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/159	Markus Kröll, Reinhard Pichler, Stefan Woltran
Model Checking Multi-Agent Systems against LDLK Specifications	We define the logic LDLK, a formalism for specifying multi-agent systems. LDLK extends LDL with epistemic modalities, including common knowledge, for reasoning about the evolution of knowledge states of the agents in the system. We study the complexity of verifying a multi-agent system against LDLK specifications and show this to be in PSPACE. We give an algorithm for the practical verification of multi-agent systems specified in LDLK. We show that the model checking algorithm, based on alternating-automata and nFA, is amenable to symbolic implementation on OBDDs. We introduce MCMAS LDLK , an extension of the open-source model checker MCMAS, implementing the algorithm and discuss the experimental results obtained.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/158	Jeremy Kong, Alessio Lomuscio
Strong Syntax Splitting for Iterated Belief Revision	AGM theory is the most influential formal account of belief revision. Nevertheless, there are some issues with the original proposal. In particular, Parikh has pointed out that completely irrelevant information may be affected in AGM revision. To remedy this, he proposed an additional axiom (P) aiming to capture (ir)relevance by a notion of syntax splitting. In this paper we generalize syntax splitting from logical sentences to epistemic states, a step which is necessary to cover iterated revision. The generalization is based on the notion of marginalization of epistemic states. Furthermore, we study epistemic syntax splitting in the context of ordinal conditional functions. Our approach substantially generalizes the semantical treatment of (P) in terms of faithful preorders recently presented by Peppas and colleagues.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/157	Gabriele Kern-Isberner, Gerhard Brewka
Foundations of Declarative Data Analysis Using Limit Datalog Programs	Motivated by applications in declarative data analysis, we study DatalogZ---an extension of positive Datalog with arithmetic functions over integers. This language is known to be undecidable, so we propose two fragments. In limit DatalogZ predicates are axiomatised to keep minimal/maximal numeric values, allowing us to show that fact entailment is coNExpTime-complete in combined, and coNP-complete in data complexity. Moreover, an additional stability requirement causes the complexity to drop to ExpTime and PTime, respectively. Finally, we show that stable DatalogZ can express many useful data analysis tasks, and so our results provide a sound foundation for the development of advanced information systems.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/156	Mark Kaminski, Bernardo Cuenca Grau, Egor V.

Query Conservative Extensions in Horn Description Logics with Inverse Roles	We investigate the decidability and computational complexity of query conservative extensions in Horn description logics (DLs) with inverse roles. This is more challenging than without inverse roles because characterizations in terms of unbounded homomorphisms between universal models fail, blocking the standard approach to establishing decidability. We resort to a combination of automata and mosaic techniques, proving that the problem is 2EXPTIME-complete in Horn-ALCHIF (and also in Horn-ALC and in ELI). We obtain the same upper bound for deductive conservative extensions, for which we also prove a coNEXPTIME lower bound.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/155	Jean Christoph Jung, Carsten Lutz, Mauricio Martel, Thomas Schneider
Belief Manipulation Through Propositional Announcements	Public announcements cause each agent in a group to modify their beliefs to incorporate some new piece of information, while simultaneously being aware that all other agents are doing the same. Given a set of agents and a set of epistemic goals, it is natural to ask if there is a single announcement that will make each agent believe the corresponding goal. This problem is known to be undecidable in a general modal setting, where the presence of nested beliefs can lead to complex dynamics. In this paper, we consider not necessarily truthful public announcements in the setting of AGM belief revision. We prove that announcement finding in this setting is not only decidable, but that it is simpler than the corresponding problem in the most simplified modal logics. We then describe AnnB, an implemented tool that uses announcement finding as the basis for controlling robot behaviour through belief manipulation.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/154	Aaron Hunter, François Schwarzentruber, Eric Tsang
ATL Strategic Reasoning Meets Correlated Equilibrium	This paper is motivated by analysing a Google self-driving car accident, i.e., the car hit a bus, with the framework and the tools of strategic reasoning by model checking. First of all, we find that existing ATL model checking may find a solution to the accident with {\it irrational} joint strategy of the bus and the car. This leads to a restriction of treating both the bus and the car as rational agents, by which their joint strategy is an equilibrium of certain solution concepts. Second, we find that a randomly-selected joint strategy from the set of equilibria may result in the collision of the two agents, i.e., the accident. Based on these, we suggest taking Correlated Equilibrium (CE) as agents' joint stratgey and optimising over the utilitarian value which is the expected sum of the agents' total rewards. The language ATL is extended with two new modalities to express the existence of an CE and a unique CE, respectively. We implement the extension into a software model checker and use the tool to analyse the examples in the paper. We also study the complexity of the model checking problems.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/153	Xiaowei Huang, Ji Ruan
A General Multi-agent Epistemic Planner Based on Higher-order Belief Change	In recent years, multi-agent epistemic planning has received attention from both dynamic logic and planning communities. Existing implementations of multi-agent epistemic planning are based on compilation into classical planning and suffer from various limitations, such as generating only linear plans, restriction to public actions, and incapability to handle disjunctive beliefs. In this paper, we propose a general representation language for multi-agent epistemic planning where the initial KB and the goal, the preconditions and effects of actions can be arbitrary multi-agent epistemic formulas, and the solution is an action tree branching on sensing results.To support efficient reasoning in the multi-agent KD45 logic, we make use of a normal form called alternative cover disjunctive formula (ACDF). We propose basic revision and update algorithms for ACDF formulas. We also handle static propositional common knowledge, which we call constraints. Based on our reasoning, revision and update algorithms, adapting the PrAO algorithm for contingent planning from the literature, we implemented a multi-agent epistemic planner called MAEP. Our experimental results show the viability of our approach.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/152	Xiao Huang, Biqing Fang, Hai Wan, Yongmei Liu
Revisiting Unrestricted Rebut and Preferences in Structured Argumentation.	In structured argumentation frameworks such as ASPIC+, rebuts are only allowed in conclusions produced by defeasible rules. This has been criticized as counter-intuitive especially in dialectical contexts. In this paper we show that ASPIC-, a system allowing for unrestricted rebuts, suffers from contamination problems. We remedy this shortcoming by generalizing the attack rule of unrestricted rebut. Our resulting system satisfies the usual rationality postulates for prioritized rule bases.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/151	Jesse Heyninck, Christian Straßer
Characterising the Manipulability of Boolean Games	The existence of (Nash) equilibria with undesirable properties is a well-known problem in game theory, which has motivated much research directed at the possibility of mechanisms for modifying games in order to eliminate undesirable equilibria, or induce desirable ones. Taxation schemes are a well-known mechanism for modifying games in this way. In the multi-agent systems community, taxation mechanisms for incentive engineering have been studied in the context of Boolean games with costs. These are games in which each player assigns truth-values to a set of propositional variables she uniquely controls in pursuit of satisfying an individual propositional goal formula; different choices for the player are also associated with different costs. In such a game, each player prefers primarily to see the satisfaction of their goal, and secondarily, to minimise the cost of their choice, thereby giving rise to lexicographic preferences over goal-satisfaction and costs. Within this setting, where taxes operate on costs only, however, it may well happen that the elimination or introduction of equilibria can only be achieved at the cost of simultaneously introducing less desirable equilibria or eliminating more attractive ones. Although this framework has been studied extensively, the problem of precisely characterising the equilibria that may be induced or eliminated has remained open. In this paper we close this problem, giving a complete characterisation of those mechanisms that can induce a set of outcomes of the game to be exactly the set of Nash Equilibrium outcomes.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/150	Paul Harrenstein, Paolo Turrini, Michael Wooldridge
Combining DL-Lite_{bool}^N with Branching Time: A gentle Marriage	We study combinations of the description logic DL-Lite_{bool}^N with the branching temporal logics CTL* and CTL. We analyse two types of combinations, both with rigid roles: (i) temporal operators are applied to concepts and to ABox assertions, and (ii) temporal operators are applied to concepts and Boolean combinations of concept inclusions and ABox assertions. For the resulting logics, we present algorithms for the satisfiability problem and (mostly tight) complexity bounds ranging from ExpTime to 3ExpTime.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/149	Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto, Jean Christoph Jung
Nash Equilibria in Concurrent Games with Lexicographic Preferences	We study concurrent games with finite-memory strategies where players are given a Buchi and a mean-payoff objective, which are related by a lexicographic order: a player first prefers to satisfy its Buchi objective, and then prefers to minimise costs, which are given by a mean-payoff function. In particular, we show that deciding the existence of a strict Nash equilibrium in such games is decidable, even if players' deviations are implemented as infinite memory strategies.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/148	Julian Gutierrez, Aniello Murano, Giuseppe Perelli, Sasha Rubin, Michael Wooldridge
Relatedness-based Multi-Entity Summarization	Representing world knowledge in a machine processable format is important as entities and their descriptions have fueled tremendous growth in knowledge-rich information processing platforms, services, and systems. Prominent applications of knowledge graphs include search engines (e.g., Google Search and Microsoft Bing), email clients (e.g., Gmail), and intelligent personal assistants (e.g., Google Now, Amazon Echo, and Apple's Siri). In this paper, we present an approach that can summarize facts about a collection of entities by analyzing their relatedness in preference to summarizing each entity in isolation. Specifically, we generate informative entity summaries by selecting: (i) inter-entity facts that are similar and (ii) intra-entity facts that are important and diverse. We employ a constrained knapsack problem solving approach to efficiently compute entity summaries. We perform both qualitative and quantitative experiments and demonstrate that our approach yields promising results compared to two other stand-alone state-of-the-art entity summarization approaches.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/147	Kalpa Gunaratna, Amir Hossein Yazdavar, Krishnaprasad Thirunarayan, Amit Sheth, Gong Cheng
Non-Determinism and the Dynamics of Knowledge	In this paper we attempt to shed light on the concept of an agent's knowledge after a non-deterministic action is executed. We start by making a comparison between notions of non-deterministic choice, and between notions of sequential composition, of settings with dynamic and/or epistemic character; namely Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL), Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), and the more recent logic of Semi-Public Environments (SPE). These logics represent two different approaches for defining the aforementioned actions, and in order to provide unified frameworks that encompass both, we define the logics DELVO (DEL+Vision+Ontic change) and PDLVE (PDL+Vision+Epistemic operators). DELVO is given a sound and complete axiomatisation.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/146	Davide Grossi, Andreas Herzig, Wiebe van der Hoek, Christos Moyzes
The Tractability of the Shapley Value over Bounded Treewidth Matching Games	Matching games form a class of coalitional games that attracted much attention in the literature. Indeed, several results are known about the complexity of computing over them {solution concepts}. In particular, it is known that computing the Shapley value is intractable in general, formally #P-hard, and feasible in polynomial time over games defined on trees. In fact, it was an open problem whether or not this tractability result holds over classes of graphs properly including acyclic ones. The main contribution of the paper is to provide a positive answer to this question, by showing that the Shapley value is tractable for matching games defined over graphs having bounded treewidth. The proposed technique has been implemented and tested on classes of graphs having different sizes and treewidth at most three.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/145	Gianluigi Greco, Francesco Lupia, Francesco Scarcello
What Can You Do with a Rock? Affordance Extraction via Word Embeddings	Autonomous agents must often detect affordances: the set of behaviors enabled by a situation. Affordance extraction is particularly helpful in domains with large action spaces, allowing the agent to prune its search space by avoiding futile behaviors. This paper presents a method for affordance extraction via word embeddings trained on a tagged Wikipedia corpus. The resulting word vectors are treated as a common knowledge database which can be queried using linear algebra. We apply this method to a reinforcement learning agent in a text-only environment and show that affordance-based action selection improves performance in most cases. Our method increases the computational complexity of each learning step but significantly reduces the total number of steps needed. In addition, the agent's action selections begin to resemble those a human would choose.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/144	Nancy Fulda, Daniel Ricks, Ben Murdoch, David Wingate
Strategically knowing how	In this paper, we propose a single-agent logic of goal-directed knowing how extending the standard epistemic logic of knowing that with a new knowing how operator. The semantics of the new operator is based on the idea that knowing how to achieve phi means that there exists a (uniform) strategy such that the agent knows that it can make sure phi. We give an intuitive axiomatisation of our logic and prove the soundness, completeness, and decidability of the logic. The crucial axioms relating knowing that and knowing how illustrate our understanding of knowing how in this setting. This logic can be used in representing and reasoning about knowledge-how.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/143	Raul Fervari, Andreas Herzig, Yanjun Li, Yanjing Wang
Process Plan Controllers for Non-Deterministic Manufacturing Systems	Determining the most appropriate means of producing a given product, i.e., which manufacturing and assembly tasks need to be performed in which order and how, is termed process planning. In process planning, abstract manufacturing tasks in a process recipe are matched to available manufacturing resources, e.g., CNC machines and robots, to give an executable process plan. A process plan controller then delegates each operation in the plan to specific manufacturing resources. In this paper we present an approach to the automated computation of process plans and process plan controllers. We extend previous work to support both non-deterministic (i.e., partially controllable) resources, and to allow operations to be performed in parallel on the same part. We show how implicit fairness assumptions can be captured in this setting, and how this impacts the definition of process plans.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/142	Paolo Felli, Lavindra de Silva, Brian Logan, Svetan Ratchev
Lazy-Grounding for Answer Set Programs with External Source Access	HEX-programs enrich the well-known Answer Set Programming (ASP) paradigm. In HEX, problems are solved using nonmonotonic logic programs with bidirectional access to external sources. ASP evaluation is traditionally based on grounding the input program first, but recent advances in lazy-grounding make the latter also interesting for HEX, as the grounding bottleneck of ASP may be avoided. We explore this issue and present a new evaluation algorithm for HEX-programs based on lazy-grounding solving for ASP. Nonmonotonic dependencies and value invention (i.e., import of new constants) from external sources make an efficient solution nontrivial. However, illustrative benchmarks show a clear advantage of the new algorithm for grounding-intense programs, which is a new perspective to make HEX more suitable for real-world application needs.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/141	Thomas Eiter, Tobias Kaminski, Antonius Weinzierl
Bounded Timed Propositional Temporal Logic with Past Captures Timeline-based Planning with Bounded Constraints	Within the timeline-based framework, planning problems are modeled as sets of independent, but interacting, components whose behavior over time is described by a set of temporal constraints. Timeline-based planning is being used successfully in a number of complex tasks, but its theoretical properties are not so well studied. In particular, while it is known that Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) can capture classical action-based planning, a similar logical characterization was not available for timeline-based planning formalisms. This paper shows that timeline-based planning with bounded temporal constraints can be captured by a bounded version of Timed Propositional Temporal Logic, augmented with past operators, which is an extension of LTL originally designed for the verification of real-time systems. As a byproduct, we get that the proposed logic is expressive enough to capture temporal action-based planning problems.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/140	Dario Della Monica, Nicola Gigante, Angelo Montanari, Pietro Sala, Guido Sciavicco
Streaming Multi-Context Systems	Multi-Context Systems (MCS) are a powerful framework to interlink heterogeneous knowledge bases under equilibrium semantics. Recent extensions of MCS to dynamic data settings either abstract from computing time, or abandon a dynamic equilibrium semantics. We thus present streaming MCS, which have a run-based semantics that accounts for asynchronous, distributed execution and supports obtaining equilibria for contexts in cyclic exchange (avoiding infinite loops); moreover, they equip MCS with native stream reasoning features. Ad-hoc query answering is NP-complete while prediction is PSpace-complete in relevant settings (but undecidable in general); tractability results for suitable restrictions.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/139	Minh Dao-Tran, Thomas Eiter
On Querying Incomplete Information in Databases under Bag Semantics	Querying incomplete data is an important task both in data management, and in many AI applications that use query rewriting to take advantage of relational database technology. Usually one looks for answers that are certain, i.e., true in every possible world represented by an incomplete database. For positive queries, expressed either in positive relational algebra or as unions of conjunctive queries, finding such answers can be done efficiently when databases and query answers are sets. Real-life databases however use bag, rather than set, semantics. For bags, instead of saying that a tuple is certainly in the answer, we have more detailed information: namely, the range of the numbers of occurrences of the tuple in query answers. We show that the behavior of positive queries is different under bag semantics: finding the minimum number of occurrences can still be done efficiently, but for maximum it becomes intractable. We use these results to investigate approximation schemes for computing certain answers to arbitrary first-order queries that have been proposed for set semantics. One of them cannot be adapted to bags, as it relies on the intractable maxima of occurrences, but another scheme only deals with minima, and we show how to adapt it to bag semantics without losing efficiency.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/138	Marco Console, Paolo Guagliardo, Leonid Libkin
Temporal Sequences of Qualitative Information: Reasoning about the Topology of Constant-Size Moving Regions	Relying on the recently introduced multi-algebras, we present a general approach for reasoning about temporal sequences of qualitative information that is generally more efficient than existing techniques. Applying our approach to the specific case of sequences of topological information about constant-size regions, we show that the resulting formalism has a complete procedure for deciding consistency, and we identify its three maximal tractable subclasses containing all basic relations.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/137	Quentin Cohen-Solal, Maroua Bouzid, Alexandre Niveau
Inferring Implicit Event Locations from Context with Distributional Similarities	"Automatic event location extraction from text plays a crucial role in many applications such as infectious disease surveillance and natural disaster monitoring. The fundamental limitation of previous work such as SpaceEval is the limited scope of extraction, targeting only at locations that are explicitly stated in a syntactic structure. This leads to missing a lot of implicit information inferable from context in a document, which amounts to nearly 40% of the entire location information. To overcome this limitation for the first time, we present a system that infers the implicit event locations from a given document. Our system exploits distributional semantics, based on the hypothesis that if two events are described by similar expressions, it is likely that they occur in the same location. For example, if ""A bomb exploded causing 30 victims"" and ""many people died from terrorist attack in Boston"" are reported in the same document, it is highly likely that the bomb exploded in Boston. Our system shows good performance of a 0.58 F1-score, where state-of-the-art classifiers for intra-sentential spatiotemporal relations achieve around 0.60 F1-scores."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/136	Jin-Woo Chung, Wonsuk Yang, Jinseon You, Jong C.

Handling non-local dead-ends in Agent Planning Programs	"We propose an approach to reason about agent planning programs with global information. Agent planning programs can be understood as a network of planning tasks, accommodating long-term goals, non-terminating behaviors, and interactive execution. We provide a technique that relies on reasoning about ``global"" dead-ends and that can be incorporated to any planning-based approach to agent planning problems. In doing so, we also introduce the notion of online execution of such planning structures. We provide experimental evidence suggesting the technique yields significant benefits."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/135	Lukas Chrpa, Nir Lipovetzky, Sebastian Sardina
Discriminative Dictionary Learning With Ranking Metric Embedded for Person Re-Identification	The goal of person re-identification (Re-Id) is to match pedestrians captured from multiple non-overlapping cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel dictionary learning based method with the ranking metric embedded, for person Re-Id. A new and essential ranking graph Laplacian term is introduced, which minimizes the intra-personal compactness and maximizes the inter-personal dispersion in the objective. Different from the traditional dictionary learning based approaches and their extensions, which just use the same or not information, our proposed method can explore the ranking relationship among the person images, which is essential for such retrieval related tasks. Simultaneously, one distance measurement has been explicitly learned in the model to further improve the performance. Since we have reformulated these ranking constraints into the graph Laplacian form, the proposed method is easy-to-implement but effective. We conduct extensive experiments on three widely used person Re-Id benchmark datasets, and achieve state-of-the-art performances.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/134	De Cheng, Xiaojun Chang, Li Liu, Alexander G.

Learning from Ontology Streams with Semantic Concept Drift	Data stream learning has been largely studied for extracting knowledge structures from continuous and rapid data records. In the semantic Web, data is interpreted in ontologies and its ordered sequence is represented as an ontology stream. Our work exploits the semantics of such streams to tackle the problem of concept drift i.e., unexpected changes in data distribution, causing most of models to be less accurate as time passes. To this end we revisited (i) semantic inference in the context of supervised stream learning, and (ii) models with semantic embeddings. The experiments show accurate prediction with data from Dublin and Beijing.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/133	Jiaoyan Chen, Freddy Lecue, Jeff Z. Pan, Huajun Chen
Most Probable Explanations for Probabilistic Database Queries	Forming the foundations of large-scale knowledge bases, probabilistic databases have been widely studied in the literature. In particular, probabilistic query evaluation has been investigated intensively as a central inference mechanism. However, despite its power, query evaluation alone cannot extract all the relevant information encompassed in large-scale knowledge bases. To exploit this potential, we study two inference tasks; namely finding the most probable database and the most probable hypothesis for a given query. As natural counterparts of most probable explanations (MPE) and maximum a posteriori hypotheses (MAP) in probabilistic graphical models, they can be used in a variety of applications that involve prediction or diagnosis tasks. We investigate these problems relative to a variety of query languages, ranging from conjunctive queries to ontology-mediated queries, and provide a detailed complexity analysis.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/132	İsmail İlkan Ceylan, Stefan Borgwardt, Thomas Lukasiewicz
Query Answering in Ontologies under Preference Rankings	We present an ontological framework, based on preference rankings, that allows users to express their preferences between the knowledge explicitly available in the ontology. Using this formalism, the answers for a given query to an ontology can be ranked by preference, allowing users to retrieve the most preferred answers only. We provide a host of complexity results for the main computational tasks in this framework, for the general case, and for EL and DL-Lite_core as underlying ontology languages.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/131	İsmail İlkan Ceylan, Thomas Lukasiewicz, Rafael Peñaloza, Oana Tifrea-Marciuska
An Algorithm for Constructing and Solving Imperfect Recall Abstractions of Large Extensive-Form Games	We solve large two-player zero-sum extensive-form games with perfect recall. We propose a new algorithm based on fictitious play that significantly reduces memory requirements for storing average strategies. The key feature is exploiting imperfect recall abstractions while preserving the convergence rate and guarantees of fictitious play applied directly to the perfect recall game. The algorithm creates a coarse imperfect recall abstraction of the perfect recall game and automatically refines its information set structure only where the imperfect recall might cause problems. Experimental evaluation shows that our novel algorithm is able to solve a simplified poker game with 7.10^5 information sets using an abstracted game with only 1.8% of information sets of the original game. Additional experiments on poker and randomly generated games suggest that the relative size of the abstraction decreases as the size of the solved games increases.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/130	Jiri Cermak, Branislav Bošanský, Viliam Lisý
Belief Change in a Preferential Non-monotonic Framework	Belief change and non-monotonic reasoning are usually viewed as two sides of the same coin, with results showing that one can formally be defined in terms of the other. In this paper we show that it also makes sense to analyse belief change within a (preferential) non-monotonic framework. We consider belief change operators in a non-monotonic propositional setting with a view towards preserving consistency. We show that the results obtained can also be applied to the preservation of coherence— an important notion within the field of logic-based ontologies. We adopt the AGM approach to belief change and show that standard AGM can be adapted to a preferential non-monotonic framework, with the definition of expansion, contraction, and revision operators, and corresponding representation results.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/129	Giovanni Casini, Thomas Meyer
Restricted Chase (Non)Termination for Existential Rules with Disjunctions	The restricted chase is a sound and complete algorithm for conjunctive query answering over ontologies of disjunctive existential rules. We develop acyclicity conditions to ensure its termination. Our criteria cannot always detect termination (the problem is undecidable), and we develop the first cyclicity criteria to show non-termination of the restricted chase. Experiments on real-world ontologies show that our acyclicity notions improve significantly over known criteria.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/128	David Carral, Irina Dragoste, Markus Krötzsch
Budget-Constrained Dynamics in Multiagent Systems	The paper introduces a notion of a budget-constrained multiagent transition system that associates two financial parameters with each transition: a pre-transition minimal budget requirement and a post-transition profit. The paper also proposes a new modal language for reasoning about such a system. The language uses a modality labeled by agent as well as by budget and profit constraints. The main technical result is a sound and complete logical system that describes all universal properties of this modality. Among these properties is a form of Transitivity axiom that captures the interplay between the budget and profit constraints.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/127	Rui Cao, Pavel Naumov
Classical Generalized Probabilistic Satisfiability	We analyze a classical generalized probabilistic satisfiability problem (GGenPSAT) which consists in deciding the satisfiability of Boolean combinations of linear inequalities involving probabilities of classical propositional formulas. GGenPSAT coincides precisely with the satisfiability problem of the probabilistic logic of Fagin et al. and was proved to be NP-complete. Here, we present a polynomial reduction of GGenPSAT to SMT over the quantifier-free theory of linear integer and real arithmetic. Capitalizing on this translation, we implement and test a solver for the GGenPSAT problem. As previously observed for many other NP-complete problems, we are able to detect a phase transition behavior for GGenPSAT.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/126	Carlos Caleiro, Filipe Casal, Andreia Mordido
Strong Inconsistency in Nonmonotonic Reasoning	Minimal inconsistent subsets of knowledge bases play an important role in classical logics, most notably for repair and inconsistency measurement. It turns out that for nonmonotonic reasoning a stronger notion is needed. In this paper we develop such a notion, called strong inconsistency. We show that—in an arbitrary logic, monotonic or not—minimal strongly inconsistent subsets play the same role as minimal inconsistent subsets in classical reasoning. In particular, we show that the well-known classical duality between hitting sets of minimal inconsistent subsets and maximal consistent subsets generalizes to arbitrary logics if the strong notion of inconsistency is used. We investigate the complexity of various related reasoning problems and present a generic algorithm for computing minimal strongly inconsistent subsets of a knowledge base. We also demonstrate the potential of our new notion for applications, focusing on repair and inconsistency measurement.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/125	Gerhard Brewka, Matthias Thimm, Markus Ulbricht
Manipulating Opinion Diffusion in Social Networks	We consider opinion diffusion in binary influence networks, where at each step one or more agents update their opinions so as to be in agreement with the majority of their neighbors. We consider several ways of manipulating the majority opinion in a stable outcome, such as bribing agents, adding/deleting links, and changing the order of updates, and investigate the computational complexity of the associated problems, identifying tractable and intractable cases.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/124	Robert Bredereck, Edith Elkind
On Coalitional Manipulation for Multiwinner Elections: Shortlisting	"Shortlisting of candidates—selecting a group of ""best"" candidates—is a special case of multiwinner elections. We provide the first in-depth study of the computational complexity of strategic voting for shortlisting based on the most natural and simple voting rule in this scenario, l-Bloc (every voter approves l candidates). In particular, we investigate the influence of several tie-breaking mechanisms (e.g. pessimistic versus optimistic) and group evaluation functions (e.g. egalitarian versus utilitarian) and conclude that in an egalitarian setting strategic voting may indeed be computationally intractable regardless of the tie-breaking rule. We provide a fairly comprehensive picture of the computational complexity landscape of this neglected scenario."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/123	Robert Bredereck, Andrzej Kaczmarczyk, Rolf Niedermeier
Making Cross Products and Guarded Ontology Languages Compatible	"Cross products form a useful modelling tool that allows us to express natural statements such as ""elephants are bigger than mice"", or, more generally, to define relations that connect every instance in a relation with every instance in another relation. Despite their usefulness, cross products cannot be expressed using existing guarded ontology languages, such as description logics (DLs) and guarded existential rules. The question that comes up is whether cross products are compatible with guarded ontology languages, and, if not, whether there is a way of making them compatible. This has been already studied for DLs, while for guarded existential rules remains unanswered. Our goal is to give an answer to the above question. To this end, we focus on the guarded fragment of first-order logic (which serves as a unifying framework that subsumes many of the aforementioned ontology languages) extended with cross products, and we investigate the standard tasks of satisfiability and query answering. Interestingly, we isolate relevant fragments that are compatible with cross products."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/122	Pierre Bourhis, Michael Morak, Andreas Pieris
Generalized Planning: Non-Deterministic Abstractions and Trajectory Constraints	We study the characterization and computation of general policies for families of problems that share a structure characterized by a common reduction into a single abstract problem. Policies mu that solve the abstract problem P have been shown to solve all problems Q that reduce to P provided that mu terminates in Q. In this work, we shed light on why this termination condition is needed and how it can be removed. The key observation is that the abstract problem P captures the common structure among the concrete problems Q that is local (Markovian) but misses common structure that is global. We show how such global structure can be captured by means of trajectory constraints that in many cases can be expressed as LTL formulas, thus reducing generalized planning to LTL synthesis. Moreover, for a broad class of problems that involve integer variables that can be increased or decreased, trajectory constraints can be compiled away, reducing generalized planning to fully observable non-deterministic planning.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/121	Blai Bonet, Giuseppe De Giacomo, Hector Geffner, Sasha Rubin
Semantics for Active Integrity Constraints Using Approximation Fixpoint Theory	"Active integrity constraints (AICs) constitute a formalism to associate with a database not just the constraints it should adhere to, but also how to fix the database in case one or more of these constraints are violated. The intuitions regarding which repairs are ""good"" given such a description are closely related to intuitions that live in various areas of non-monotonic reasoning. In this paper, we apply approximation fixpoint theory, an algebraic framework that unifies semantics of non-monotonic logics, to the field of AICs. This results in a new family of semantics for AICs, of which we study semantics and relationships to existing semantics. We argue that the AFT-well-founded semantics has some desirable properties."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/120	Bart Bogaerts, Luís Cruz-Filipe
Safe Inductions: An Algebraic Study	In many knowledge representation formalisms, a constructive semantics is defined based on sequential applications of rules or of a semantic operator. These constructions often share the property that rule applications must be delayed until it is safe to do so: until it is known that the condition that triggers the rule will remain to hold. This intuition occurs for instance in the well-founded semantics of logic programs and in autoepistemic logic. In this paper, we formally define the safety criterion algebraically. We study properties of so-called safe inductions and apply our theory to logic programming and autoepistemic logic. For the latter, we show that safe inductions manage to capture the intended meaning of a class of theories on which all classical constructive semantics fail.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/119	Bart Bogaerts, Joost Vennekens, Marc Denecker
The Impact of Treewidth on ASP Grounding and Solving	In this paper, we aim to study how the performance of modern answer set programming (ASP) solvers is influenced by the treewidth of the input program and to investigate the consequences of this relationship. We first perform an experimental evaluation that shows that the solving performance is heavily influenced by the treewidth, given ground input programs that are otherwise uniform, both in size and construction. This observation leads to an important question for ASP, namely, how to design encodings such that the treewidth of the resulting ground program remains small. To this end, we define the class of connection-guarded programs, which guarantees that the treewidth of the program after grounding only depends on the treewidth (and the degree) of the input instance. In order to obtain this result, we formalize the grounding process using MSO transductions.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/118	Bernhard Bliem, Marius Moldovan, Michael Morak, Stefan Woltran
Ontology-Mediated Query Answering for Key-Value Stores	We propose a novel rule-based ontology language for JSON records and investigate its computational properties. After providing a natural translation into first-order logic, we identify relationships to existing ontology languages, which yield decidability of query answering but only rough complexity bounds. By establishing an interesting and non-trivial connection to word rewriting, we are able to pinpoint the exact combined complexity of query answering in our framework and obtain tractability results for data complexity. The upper bounds are proven using a query reformulation technique, which can be implemented on top of key-value stores, thereby exploiting their querying facilities.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/117	Meghyn Bienvenu, Pierre Bourhis, Marie-Laure Mugnier, Sophie Tison, Federico Ulliana
Reformulating Queries: Theory and Practice	We consider a setting where a user wants to pose a query against a dataset where background knowledge, expressed as logical sentences, is available, but only a subset of the information can be used to answer the query. We thus want to reformulate the user query against the subvocabulary, arriving at a query equivalent to the user's query assuming the background theory, but using only the restricted vocabulary. We consider two variations of the problem, one where we want any such reformulation and another where we restrict the size. We present a classification of the complexity of the problem, then provide algorithms for solving the problems in practice and evaluate their performance.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/116	Michael Benedikt, Egor V.

Reasoning about Probabilities in Unbounded First-Order Dynamical Domains	When it comes to robotic agents operating in an uncertain world, a major concern in knowledge representation is to better relate high-level logical accounts of belief and action to the low-level probabilistic sensorimotor data. Perhaps the most general formalism for dealing with degrees of belief and, in particular, how such beliefs should evolve in the presence of noisy sensing and acting is the account by Bacchus, Halpern, and Levesque. In this paper, we reconsider that model of belief, and propose a new logical variant that has much of the expressive power of the original, but goes beyond it in novel ways. In particular, by moving to a semantical account of a modal variant of the situation calculus based on possible worlds with unbounded domains and probabilistic distributions over them, we are able to capture the beliefs of a fully introspective knowledge base with uncertainty by way of an only-believing operator. The paper introduces the new logic and discusses key properties as well as examples that demonstrate how the beliefs of a knowledge base change as a result of noisy actions.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/115	Vaishak Belle, Gerhard Lakemeyer
Dynamic Logic for Data-aware Systems: Decidability Results	We introduce a first-order extension of dynamic logic (FO-DL), suitable to represent and reason about the behaviour of Data-aware Systems (DaS), which are systems whose data content is explicitly exhibited in the system's description. We illustrate the expressivity of the formal framework by modelling English auctions as DaS, and by specifying relevant properties in FO-DL. Most importantly, we develop an abstraction-based verification procedure, thus proving that the model checking problem for DaS against FO-DL is actually decidable, provided some mild assumptions on the interpretationdomain.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/114	Francesco Belardinelli, Andreas Herzig
A Model for Accountable Ordinal Sorting	We address the problem of multicriteria ordinalsorting through the lens of accountability, i.e. theability of a human decision-maker to own a recommendationmade by the system. We put forward anumber of model features that would favor the capabilityto support the recommendation with a convincingexplanation. To account for that, we designa recommender system implementing and formalizingsuch features. This system outputs explanationsdefined under the form of specific argumentschemes tailored to represent the specific rules ofthe model. At the end, we discuss possible andpromising argumentative perspectives.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/113	Khaled  Belahcene, Christophe Labreuche, Nicolas Maudet, Vincent Mousseau, Wassila Ouerdane
A Study of Unrestricted Abstract Argumentation Frameworks	Research in abstract argumentation typically per-tains to finite argumentation frameworks (AFs). Ac-tual or potential infinite AFs frequently occur if theyare used for the purpose of nonmonotonic entail-ment, so-called instantiation-based argumentation,or if they are involved as modeling tool for dia-logues, n-person-games or action sequences. Apartfrom these practical cases a profound analysis yieldsa better understanding of how the nonmonotonic the-ory of abstract argumentation works in general. Inthis paper we study a bunch of abstract propertieslike SCC-recursiveness, expressiveness or intertrans-latability for unrestricted AFs.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/112	Ringo Baumann, Christof Spanring
A General Notion of Equivalence for Abstract Argumentation	We introduce a parametrized equivalence notion for abstract argumentation that subsumes standard and strong equivalence as corner cases. Under this notion, two argumentation frameworks are equivalent if they deliver the same extensions under any addition of arguments and attacks that do not affect a given set of core arguments. As we will see, this notion of equivalence nicely captures the concept of local simplifications. We provide exact characterizations and complexity results for deciding our new notion of equivalence.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/111	Ringo Baumann, Wolfgang Dvořák, Thomas Linsbichler, Stefan Woltran
Answering Conjunctive Regular Path Queries over Guarded Existential Rules	Ontology-mediated query answering is concerned with the problem of answering queries over knowledge bases consisting of a database instance and an ontology. While most work in the area focuses on conjunctive queries, navigational queries are gaining increasing attention. In this paper, we investigate the complexity of answering two-way conjunctive regular path queries (CRPQs) over knowledge bases whose ontology is given by a set of guarded existential rules. We first consider the subclass of linear existential rules and show that CRPQ answering is EXPTIME-complete in combined complexity and NL-complete in data complexity, matching the recently established bounds for answering non-conjunctive RPQs. For guarded rules, we provide a non-trivial reduction to the linear case, which allows us to show that the complexity of CRPQ answering is the same as for plain conjunctive queries, namely, 2EXPTIME-complete in combined complexity and PTIME-complete in data complexity.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/110	Jean-François Baget, Meghyn Bienvenu, Marie-Laure Mugnier, Michael Thomazo
Query Rewriting for DL-Lite with n-ary Concrete Domains	We investigate ontology-based query answering (OBQA) in a setting where both the ontology and the query can refer to concrete values such as numbers and strings. In contrast to previous work on this topic, the built-in predicates used to compare values are not restricted to being unary. We introduce restrictions on these predicates and on the ontology language that allow us to reduce OBQA to query answering in databases using the so-called combined rewriting approach. Though at first sight our restrictions are different from the ones used in previous work, we show that our results strictly subsume some of the existing first-order rewritability results for unary predicates.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/109	Franz Baader, Stefan Borgwardt, Marcel Lippmann
Weakening Covert Networks by Minimizing Inverse Geodesic Length	We consider the problem of deleting nodes in a covert network to minimize its performance. The inverse geodesic length (IGL) is a well-known and widely used measure of network performance. It equals the sum of the inverse distances of all pairs of vertices. In the MinIGL problem the input is a graph $G$, a budget $k$, and a target IGL $T$, and the question is whether there exists a subset of vertices $X$ with $|X|=k$, such that the IGL of $G-X$ is at most $T$. In network analysis, the IGL is often used to evaluate how well heuristics perform in strengthening or weakening a network. In this paper, we undertake a study of the classical and parameterized complexity of the MinIGL problem. The problem is NP-complete even if $T=0$ and remains both NP-complete and $W[1]$-hard for parameter $k$ on bipartite and on split graphs. On the positive side, we design several multivariate algorithms for the problem. Our main result is an algorithm for MinIGL parameterized by the twin cover number.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/108	Haris Aziz, Serge Gaspers, Kamran Najeebullah
Epistemic-entrenchment Characterization of Parikh’s Axiom	In this article, we provide the epistemic-entrenchment characterization of the weak version of Parikh's relevance-sensitive axiom for belief revision — known as axiom (P) — for the general case of incomplete theories. Loosely speaking, axiom (P) states that, if a belief set K can be divided into two disjoint compartments, and the new information φ relates only to the first compartment, then the second compartment should not be affected by the revision of K by φ. The above-mentioned characterization, essentially, constitutes additional constraints on epistemic-entrenchment preorders, that induce AGM revision functions, satisfying the weak version of Parikh's axiom (P).	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/107	Theofanis Aravanis, Pavlos Peppas, Mary-Anne Williams
On the Computational Complexity of Gossip Protocols	Gossip protocols deal with a group of communicating agents, each holding a private information, and aim at arriving at a situation in which all the agents know each other secrets. Distributed epistemic gossip protocols are particularly simple distributed programs that use formulas from an epistemic logic. Recently, the implementability of these distributed protocols was established (which means that the evaluation of these formulas is decidable), and the problems of their partial correctness and termination were shown to be decidable, but their exact computational complexity was left open. We show that for any monotonic type of calls the implementability of a distributed epistemic gossip protocol is a P^{NP}_{||}-complete problem, while the problems of its partial correctness and termination are in coNP^{NP}.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/106	Krzysztof R.

Player Movement Models for Video Game Level Generation	The use of statistical and machine learning approaches, such as Markov chains, for procedural content generation (PCG) has been growing in recent years in the field of Game AI. However, there has been little work in learning to generate content, specifically levels, accounting for player movement within those levels. We are interested in extracting player models automatically from play traces and using those learned models, paired with a machine learning-based generator to create levels that allow the same types of movements observed in the play traces. We test our approach by generating levels for Super Mario Bros. We compare our results against the original levels, a previous constrained sampling approach, and a previous approach that learned a combined player and level model.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/105	Sam Snodgrass, Santiago Ontañón
Nonlinear Hybrid Planning with Deep Net Learned Transition Models and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming	In many real-world hybrid (mixed discrete continuous) planning problems such as Reservoir Control, Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC), and Navigation, it is difficult to obtain a model of the complex nonlinear dynamics that govern state evolution. However, the ubiquity of modern sensors allow us to collect large quantities of data from each of these complex systems and build accurate, nonlinear deep network models of their state transitions. But there remains one major problem for the task of control -- how can we plan with deep network learned transition models without resorting to Monte Carlo Tree Search and other black-box transition model techniques that ignore model structure and do not easily extend to mixed discrete and continuous domains? In this paper, we make the critical observation that the popular Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) transfer function for deep networks not only allows accurate nonlinear deep net model learning, but also permits a direct compilation of the deep network transition model to a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) encoding in a planner we call Hybrid Deep MILP Planning (HD-MILP-PLAN). We identify deep net specific optimizations and a simple sparsification method for HD-MILP-PLAN that improve performance over a naive encoding, and show that we are able to plan optimally with respect to the learned deep network.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/104	Buser Say, Ga Wu, Yu Qing Zhou, Scott Sanner
Temporal Planning with Clock-Based SMT Encodings	We propose more scalable encodings of temporal planning in SMT. The first contribution is practical clock-based encodings of resources and effect delays. Existing encodings of effect delays (Shin and Davis, 2015) have a quadratic size, due to the necessity to determine the time differences between steps for a linear number of steps. Clocks improve this to linear. The second contribution is a new relaxed scheme for steps. Existing schemes require a step for every time point with discontinuous change. This is relaxed, improving scalability.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/103	Jussi Rintanen
On Neighborhood Singleton Consistencies	CP solvers predominantly use arc consistency (AC) as the default propagation method. Many stronger consistencies, such as triangle consistencies (e.g. RPC and maxRPC) exist, but their use is limited despite results showing that they outperform AC on many problems. This is due to the intricacies involved in incorporating them into solvers. On the other hand, singleton consistencies such as SAC can be easily crafted into solvers but they are too expensive. We seek a balance between the efficiency of triangle consistencies and the ease of implementation of singleton ones. Using the recently proposed variant of SAC called Neighborhood SAC as basis, we propose a family of weaker singleton consistencies. We study them theoretically, comparing their pruning power to existing consistencies. We make a detailed experimental study using a very simple algorithm for their implementation. Results demonstrate that they outperform the existing propagation techniques, often by orders of magnitude, on a wide range of problems.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/102	Anastasia Paparrizou, Kostas Stergiou
Constraint Games revisited	Constraint Games are a recent framework proposed to model and solve static games where Constraint Programming is used to express players preferences. In this paper, we rethink their solving technique in terms of constraint propagation by considering players preferences as global constraints. It yields not only a more elegant but also a more efficient framework. Our new complete solver is faster than previous state-of-the-art and is able to find all pure Nash equilibria for some problems with 200 players. We also show that performances can greatly be improved for graphical games, allowing some games with 2000 players to be solved.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/101	Anthony Palmieri, Arnaud Lallouet
Efficient Weighted Model Integration via SMT-Based Predicate Abstraction	Weighted model integration (WMI) is a recent formalism generalizing weighted model counting (WMC) to run probabilistic inference over hybrid domains, characterized by both discrete and continuous variables and relationships between them. Albeit powerful, the original formulation of WMI suffers from some theoretical limitations, and it is computationally very demanding as it requires to explicitly enumerate all possible models to be integrated over. In this paper we present a novel general notion of WMI, which fixes the theoretical limitations and allows for exploiting the power of SMT-based predicate abstraction techniques. A novel algorithm combines a strong reduction in the number of models to be integrated over with their efficient enumeration. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data show drastic computational improvements over the original WMI formulation as well as existing alternatives for hybrid inference.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/100	Paolo  Morettin, Andrea Passerini, Roberto Sebastiani
A Partitioning Algorithm for Maximum Common Subgraph Problems	We introduce a new branch and bound algorithm for the maximum common subgraph and maximum common connected subgraph problems which is based around vertex labelling and partitioning. Our method in some ways resembles a traditional constraint programming approach, but uses a novel compact domain store and supporting inference algorithms which dramatically reduce the memory and computation requirements during search, and allow better dual viewpoint ordering heuristics to be calculated cheaply. Experiments show a speedup of more than an order of magnitude over the state of the art, and demonstrate that we can operate on much larger graphs without running out of memory.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/99	Ciaran McCreesh, Patrick Prosser, James Trimble
An Effective Learnt Clause Minimization Approach for CDCL SAT Solvers	Learnt clauses in CDCL SAT solvers often contain redundant literals. This may have a negative impact on performance because redundant literals may deteriorate both the effectiveness of Boolean constraint propagation and the quality of subsequent learnt clauses. To overcome this drawback, we define a new inprocessing SAT approach which eliminates redundant literals from learnt clauses by applying Boolean constraint propagation. Learnt clause minimization is activated before the SAT solver triggers some selected restarts, and affects only some learnt clauses during the search process. Moreover, we conducted an empirical evaluation on instances coming from the hard combinatorial and application categories of recent SAT competitions. The results show that a remarkable number of additional instances are solved when the approach is incorporated into five of the best performing CDCL SAT solvers (Glucose, TC_Glucose, COMiniSatPS, MapleCOMSPS and MapleCOMSPS_LRB).	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/98	Mao Luo, Chu-Min Li, Fan Xiao, Felip Manyà, Zhipeng Lü
Enhancing Campaign Design in Crowdfunding: A Product Supply Optimization Perspective	Crowdfunding is an emerging Internet application for creators designing campaigns (projects) to collect funds from public investors. Usually, the limited budget of the creator is manually divided into several perks (reward options), that should fit various market demand and further bring different monetary contributions for the campaign. Therefore, it is very challenging for each creator to design an effective campaign. To this end, in this paper, we aim to enhance the funding performance of the newly proposed campaigns, with a focus on optimizing the product supply of perks. Specifically, given the expected budget and the perks of a campaign, we propose a novel solution to automatically recommend the optimal product supply to every perk for balancing the expected return of this campaign against the risk. Along this line, we define it as a constrained portfolio selection problem, where the risk of each campaign is measured by a multi-task learning method. Finally, experimental results on the real-world crowdfunding data clearly prove that the optimized product supply can help improve the campaign performance significantly, and meanwhile, our multi-task learning method could more precisely estimate the risk of each campaign.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/97	Qi Liu, Guifeng Wang, Hongke Zhao, Chuanren Liu, Tong Xu, Enhong Chen
Solving Stochastic Boolean Satisfiability under Random-Exist Quantification	Stochastic Boolean Satisfiability (SSAT) is a powerful formalism to represent computational problems with uncertainly, such as belief network inference and propositional probabilistic planning. Solving SSAT formulas lies in the same complexity class (PSPACE-complete) as solving Quantified Boolean Formula (QBF). While many endeavors have been made to enhance QBF solving, SSAT has drawn relatively less attention in recent years. This paper focuses on random-exist quantified SSAT formulas, and proposes an algorithm combining binary decision diagram (BDD), logic synthesis, and modern SAT techniques to improve computational efficiency. Unlike prior exact SSAT algorithms, the proposed method can be easily modified to solve approximate SSAT by deriving upper and lower bounds of satisfying probability. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm on random k-CNF formulas and has effective application to approximate SSAT on circuit benchmarks.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/96	Nian-Ze Lee, Yen-Shi Wang, Jie-Hong R.

Automatic Synthesis of Smart Table Constraints by Abstraction of Table Constraints	The smart table constraint represents a powerful modeling tool that has been recently introduced. This constraint allows the user to represent compactly a number of well-known (global) constraints and more generally any arbitrarily structured constraints, especially when disjunction is at stake. In many problems, some constraints are given under the basic and simple form of tables explicitly listing the allowed combinations of values. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to convert automatically any (ordinary) table into a compact smart table. Its theoretical time complexity is shown to be quadratic in the size of the input table. Experimental results demonstrate its compression efficiency on many constraint cases while showing its reasonable execution time. It is then shown that using filtering algorithms on the resulting smart table is more efficient than using state of the art filtering algorithms on the initial table.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/95	Baudouin Le Charlier, Minh Thanh Khong, Christophe Lecoutre, Yves Deville
A Recursive Shortcut for CEGAR: Application To The Modal Logic K Satisfiability Problem	Counter-Example-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR) has been very successful in model checking large systems. Since then, it has been applied to many different problems. It especially proved to be an highly successful practical approach for solving the PSPACE complete QBF problem. In this paper, we propose a new CEGAR-like approach for tackling PSPACE complete problems that we call RECAR (Recursive Explore and Check Abstraction Refinement). We show that this generic approach is sound and complete. Then we propose a specific implementation of the RECAR approach to solve the modal logic K satisfiability problem. We implemented both a CEGAR and a RECAR approach for the modal logic K satisfiability problem within the solver MoSaiC. We compared experimentally those approaches to the state-of-the-art solvers for that problem. The RECAR approach outperforms the CEGAR one for that problem and also compares favorably against the state-of-the-art on the benchmarks considered.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/94	Jean-Marie Lagniez, Daniel Le Berre, Tiago de Lima, Valentin Montmirail
An Improved Decision-DNNF Compiler	We present and evaluate a new compiler, called d4, targeting the Decision-DNNF language. As the state-of-the-art compilers C2D and Dsharp targeting the same language, d4 is a top-down tree-search algorithm exploring the space of propositional interpretations. d4 is based on the same ingredients as those considered in C2D and Dsharp (mainly, disjoint component analysis, conflict analysis and non-chronological backtracking, component caching). d4 takes advantage of a dynamic decomposition approach based on hypergraph partitioning, used sparingly. Some simplification rules are also used to minimize the time spent in the partitioning steps and to promote the quality of the decompositions. Experiments show that the compilation times and the sizes of the Decision-DNNF representations computed by d4 are in many cases significantly lower than the ones obtained by C2D and Dsharp.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/93	Jean-Marie Lagniez, Pierre Marquis
Learning to Run Heuristics in Tree Search	``Primal heuristics'' are a key contributor to the improved performance of exact branch-and-bound solvers for combinatorial optimization and integer programming. Perhaps the most crucial question concerning primal heuristics is that of at which nodes they should run, to which the typical answer is via hard-coded rules or fixed solver parameters tuned, offline, by trial-and-error. Alternatively, a heuristic should be run when it is most likely to succeed, based on the problem instance's characteristics, the state of the search, etc. In this work, we study the problem of deciding at which node a heuristic should be run, such that the overall (primal) performance of the solver is optimized. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at formalizing and systematically addressing this problem. Central to our approach is the use of Machine Learning (ML) for predicting whether a heuristic will succeed at a given node. We give a theoretical framework for analyzing this decision-making process in a simplified setting, propose a ML approach for modeling heuristic success likelihood, and design practical rules that leverage the ML models to dynamically decide whether to run a heuristic at each node of the search tree. Experimentally, our approach improves the primal performance of a state-of-the-art Mixed Integer Programming solver by up to 6% on a set of benchmark instances, and by up to 60% on a family of hard Independent Set instances.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/92	Elias B.

Cardinality Encodings for Graph Optimization Problems	Different optimization problems defined on graphs find application in complex network analysis. Existing propositional encodings render impractical the use of propositional satisfiability (SAT) and maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) solvers for solving a variety of these problems on large graphs. This paper has two main contributions. First, the paper identifies sources of inefficiency in existing encodings for different optimization problems in graphs. Second, for the concrete case of the maximum clique problem, the paper develops a novel encoding which is shown to be far more compact than existing encodings for large sparse graphs. More importantly, the experimental results show that the proposed encoding enables existing SAT solvers to compute a maximum clique for large sparse networks, often more efficiently than the state of the art.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/91	Alexey Ignatiev, Antonio Morgado, Joao Marques-Silva
A Core-Guided Approach to Learning Optimal Causal Graphs	Discovery of causal relations is an important part of data analysis. Recent exact Boolean optimization approaches enable tackling very general search spaces of causal graphs with feedback cycles and latent confounders, simultaneously obtaining high accuracy by optimally combining conflicting independence information in sample data. We propose several domain-specific techniques and integrate them into a core-guided maximum satisfiability solver, thereby speeding up current state of the art in exact search for causal graphs with cycles and latent confounders on simulated and real-world data.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/90	Antti Hyttinen, Paul Saikko, Matti Järvisalo
Locality in Random SAT Instances	Despite the success of CDCL SAT solvers solving industrial problems, there are still many open questions to explain such success. In this context, the generation of random SAT instances having computational properties more similar to real-world problems becomes crucial. Such generators are possibly the best tool to analyze families of instances and solvers behaviors on them. In this paper, we present a random SAT instances generator based on the notion of locality. We show that this is a decisive dimension of attractiveness among the variables of a formula, and how CDCL SAT solvers take advantage of it. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first random SAT model that generates both scale-free structure and community structure at once.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/89	Jesús Giráldez-Cru, Jordi Levy
Finding Robust Solutions to Stable Marriage	We study the notion of robustness in stable matching problems. We first define robustness by introducing (a,b)-supermatches. An (a,b)-supermatch is a stable matching in which if a pairs break up it is possible to find another stable matching by changing the partners of those a pairs and at most b other pairs. In this context, we define the most robust stable matching as a (1,b)-supermatch where b is minimum. We show that checking whether a given stable matching is a (1,b)-supermatch can be done in polynomial time. Next, we use this procedure to design a constraint programming model, a local search approach, and a genetic algorithm to find the most robust stable matching. Our empirical evaluation on large instances show that local search outperforms the other approaches.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/88	Begum Genc, Mohamed Siala, Barry O'Sullivan, Gilles Simonin
Restart and Random Walk in Local Search for Maximum Vertex Weight Cliques with Evaluations in Clustering Aggregation	The Maximum Vertex Weight Clique (MVWC) problem is NP-hard and also important in real-world applications. In this paper we propose to use the restart and the random walk strategies to improve local search for MVWC. If a solution is revisited in some particular situation, the search will restart. In addition, when the local search has no other options except dropping vertices, it will use random walk. Experimental results show that our solver outperforms state-of-the-art solvers in DIMACS and finds a new best-known solution. Also it is the unique solver which is comparable with state-of-the-art methods on both BHOSLIB and large crafted graphs. Furthermore we evaluated our solver in clustering aggregation. Experimental results on a number of real data sets demonstrate that our solver outperforms the state-of-the-art for solving the derived MVWC problem and helps improve the final clustering results.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/87	Yi Fan, Nan Li, Chengqian Li, Zongjie Ma, Longin Jan Latecki, Kaile Su
Personnel Scheduling as Satisfiability Modulo Theories	Rotating workforce scheduling (RWS) is an important real-life personnel rostering problem that appears in a large number of different business areas. In this paper, we propose a new exact approach to RWS that exploits the recent advances on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). While solving can be automated by using a number of so-called SMT-solvers, the most challenging task is to find an efficient formulation of the problem in first-order logic. We propose two new modeling techniques for RWS that encode the problem using formulas over different background theories. The first encoding provides an elegant approach based on linear integer arithmetic. Furthermore, we developed a new formulation based on bitvectors in order to achieve a more compact representation of the constraints and a reduced number of variables. These two modeling approaches were experimentally evaluated on benchmark instances from literature using different state-of-the-art SMT-solvers. Compared to other exact methods, the results of this approach showed an important improvement in the number of found solutions.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/86	Christoph Erkinger, Nysret Musliu
Solving Integer Linear Programs with a Small Number of Global Variables and Constraints	Integer Linear Programming (ILP) has a broad range of applications in various areas of artificial intelligence. Yet in spite of recent advances, we still lack a thorough understanding of which structural restrictions make ILP tractable. Here we study ILP instances consisting of a small number of ``global'' variables and/or constraints such that the remaining part of the instance consists of small and otherwise independent components; this is captured in terms of a structural measure we call fracture backdoors which generalizes, for instance, the well-studied class of N-fold ILP instances. Our main contributions can be divided into three parts. First, we formally develop fracture backdoors and obtain exact and approximation algorithms for computing these. Second, we exploit these backdoors to develop several new parameterized algorithms for ILP; the performance of these algorithms will naturally scale based on the number of global variables or constraints in the instance. Finally, we complement the developed algorithms with matching lower bounds. Altogether, our results paint a near-complete complexity landscape of ILP with respect to fracture backdoors.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/85	Pavel Dvořák, Eduard Eiben, Robert Ganian, Dušan Knop, Sebastian Ordyniak
The Hard Problems Are Almost Everywhere For Random CNF-XOR Formulas	Recent universal-hashing based approaches to sampling and counting crucially depend on the runtime performance of SAT solvers on formulas expressed as the conjunction of both CNF constraints and variable-width XOR constraints (known as CNF-XOR formulas). In this paper, we present the first study of the runtime behavior of SAT solvers equipped with XOR-reasoning techniques on random CNF-XOR formulas. We empirically demonstrate that a state-of-the-art SAT solver scales exponentially on random CNF-XOR formulas across a wide range of XOR-clause densities, peaking around the empirical phase-transition location. On the theoretical front, we prove that the solution space of a random CNF-XOR formula 'shatters' at all nonzero XOR-clause densities into well-separated components, similar to the behavior seen in random CNF formulas known to be difficult for many SAT algorithms.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/84	Jeffrey M.

Learning-Based Abstractions for Nonlinear Constraint Solving	We propose a new abstraction refinement procedure based on machine learning to improve the performance of nonlinear constraint solving algorithms on large-scale problems. The proposed approach decomposes the original set of constraints into smaller subsets, and uses learning algorithms to propose sequences of abstractions that take the form of conjunctions of classifiers. The core procedure is a refinement loop that keeps improving the learned results based on counterexamples that are obtained from partial constraints that are easy to solve. Experiments show that the proposed techniques significantly improve the performance of state-of-the-art constraint solvers on many challenging benchmarks. The mechanism is capable of producing intermediate symbolic abstractions that are also important for many applications and for understanding the internal structures of hard constraint solving problems.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/83	Sumanth Dathathri, Nikos Arechiga, Sicun Gao, Richard M.

The DNA Word Design Problem: A New Constraint Model and New Results	A fundamental problem in coding theory concerns the computation of the maximum cardinality of a set S of length n code words over an alphabet of size q, such that every pair of code words has Hamming distance at least d, and the set of additional constraints U on S is satisfied. This problem has application in several areas, one of which is the design of DNA codes where q=4 and the alphabet is {A,C,G,T}. We describe a new constraint model for this problem and demonstrate that it improves on previous solutions (computes better lower bounds) for various instances of the problem. Our approach is based on a clustering of DNA words into small sets of words. Solutions are then obtained as the union of such clusters. Our approach is SAT based: we specify constraints on clusters of DNA words and solve these using a Boolean satisfiability solver.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/82	Michael Codish, Michael Frank, Vitaly Lagoon
On the Kernelization of Global Constraints	"Kernelization is a powerful concept from parameterized complexity theory that captures (a certain idea of) efficient polynomial-time preprocessing for hard decision problems. However, exploiting this technique in the context of constraint programming is challenging. Building on recent results for the VertexCover constraint, we introduce novel ""loss-less"" kernelization variants that are tailored for constraint propagation. We showcase the theoretical interest of our ideas on two constraints, VertexCover and EdgeDominatingSet."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/81	Clément Carbonnel, Emmanuel Hebrard
From Decimation to Local Search and Back: A New Approach to MaxSAT	Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) is an important NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with many applications and MaxSAT solving has attracted much interest. This work proposes a new incomplete approach to MaxSAT. We propose a novel decimation algorithm for MaxSAT, and then combine it with a local search algorithm. Our approach works by interleaving between the decimation algorithm and the local search algorithm, with useful information passed between them. Experiments show that our solver DeciLS achieves state of the art performance on all unweighted benchmarks from the MaxSAT Evaluation 2016. Moreover, compared to SAT-based MaxSAT solvers which dominate industrial benchmarks for years, it performs better on industrial benchmarks and significantly better on application formulas from SAT Competition. We also extend this approach to (Weighted) Partial MaxSAT, and the resulting solvers significantly improve local search solvers on crafted and industrial benchmarks, and are complementary (better on WPMS crafted benchmarks) to SAT-based solvers.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/80	Shaowei Cai, Chuan Luo, Haochen Zhang
Relaxed Exists-Step Plans in Planning as SMT	Planning Modulo Theories (PMT), inspired by Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), allows the integration of arbitrary first order theories, such as linear arithmetic, with propositional planning. Under this setting, planning as SAT is generalized to planning as SMT. In this paper we introduce a new encoding for planning as SMT, which adheres to the relaxed relaxed ∃-step (R 2 ∃-step) semantics for parallel plans. We show the benefits of relaxing the requirements on the set of actions eligible to be executed at the same time, even though many redundant actions can be introduced. We also show how, by a MaxSMT based post-processing step, redundant actions can be efficiently removed, and provide experimental results showing the benefits of this approach.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/79	Miquel Bofill, Joan Espasa, Mateu Villaret
Compact MDDs for Pseudo-Boolean Constraints with At-Most-One Relations in Resource-Constrained Scheduling Problems	Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints are usually encoded into Boolean clauses using compact Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) representations. Although these constraints appear in many problems, they are particularly useful for representing resource constraints in scheduling problems. Sometimes, the Boolean variables in the PB constraints have implicit at-most-one relations. In this work we introduce a way to take advantage of these implicit relations to obtain a compact Multi-Decision Diagram (MDD) representation for those PB constraints. We provide empirical evidence of the usefulness of this technique for some Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) variants, namely the Multi-Mode RCPSP (MRCPSP) and the RCPSP with Time-Dependent Resource Capacities and Requests (RCPSP/t). The size reduction of the representation of the PB constraints lets us decrease the number of Boolean variables in the encodings by one order of magnitude. We close/certify the optimum of many instances of these problems.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/78	Miquel Bofill, Jordi Coll, Josep Suy, Mateu Villaret
Scalable Constraint-based Virtual Data Center Allocation	Constraint-based techniques can solve challenging problems arising from highly diverse applications. This paper considers the problem of virtual data center (VDC) allocation, an important, emerging challenge for modern data center operators. To solve this problem, we introduce NETSOLVER, which is based on the general-purpose constraint solver MONOSAT. NETSOLVER represents a major improvement over existing approaches: it is sound, complete, and scalable, providing support for end-to-end, multi-path bandwidth guarantees across all the layers of hosting infrastructure, from servers to top-of-rack switches to aggregation switches to access routers. NETSOLVER scales to realistic data center sizes and VDC topologies, typically requiring just seconds to allocate VDCs of 5–15 virtual machines to physical data centers with 1000+ servers, maintaining this efficiency even when the data center is nearly saturated. In many cases, NETSOLVER can allocate 150%−300% as many total VDCs to the same physical data center as previous methods. Essential to our solution efficiency is our formulation of VDC allocation using monotonic theories, illustrating the practical value of the recently proposed SAT modulo monotonic theories approach.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/77	Sam Bayless, Nodir Kodirov, Ivan Beschastnikh, Holger H.

Stochastic Constraint Programming with And-Or Branch-and-Bound	Complex multi-stage decision making problems often involve uncertainty, for example, regarding demand or processing times. Stochastic constraint programming was proposed as a way to formulate and solve such decision problems, involving arbitrary constraints over both decision and random variables. What stochastic constraint programming still lacks is support for the use of factorized probabilistic models that are popular in the graphical model community. We show how a state-of-the-art probabilistic inference engine can be integrated into standard constraint solvers. The resulting approach searches over the And-Or search tree directly, and we investigate tight bounds on the expected utility objective. This significantly improves search efficiency and outperforms scenario-based methods that ground out the possible worlds.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/76	Behrouz Babaki, Tias Guns, Luc de Raedt
Generating Hard Random Boolean Formulas and Disjunctive Logic Programs	We propose a model of random quantified boolean formulas and their natural random disjunctive logic program counterparts. The model extends the standard models for random SAT and 2QBF. We provide theoretical bounds for the phase transition region in the new model, and show experimentally the presence of the easy-hard-easy pattern. Importantly, we show that the model is well suited for assessing solvers tuned to real-world instances. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, our model and results on random disjunctive logic programs are the first of their kind.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/75	Giovanni Amendola, Francesco Ricca, Miroslaw Truszczynski
The Mixing of Markov Chains on Linear Extensions in Practice	We investigate almost uniform sampling from the set of linear extensions of a given partial order. The most efficient schemes stem from Markov chains whose mixing time bounds are polynomial, yet impractically large. We show that, on instances one encounters in practice, the actual mixing times can be much smaller than the worst-case bounds, and particularly so for a novel Markov chain we put forward. We circumvent the inherent hardness of estimating standard mixing times by introducing a refined notion, which admits estimation for moderate-size partial orders. Our empirical results suggest that the Markov chain approach to sample linear extensions can be made to scale well in practice, provided that the actual mixing times can be realized by instance-sensitive upper bounds or termination rules. Examples of the latter include existing perfect simulation algorithms, whose running times in our experiments follow the actual mixing times of certain chains, albeit with significant overhead.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/74	Topi Talvitie, Teppo Niinimäki, Mikko Koivisto
A Reduction based Method for Coloring Very Large Graphs	The graph coloring problem (GCP) is one of the most studied NP hard problems and has numerous applications. Despite the practical importance of GCP, there are limited works in solving GCP for very large graphs. This paper explores techniques for solving GCP on very large real world graphs.We first propose a reduction rule for GCP, which is based on a novel concept called degree bounded independent set.The rule is iteratively executed by interleaving between lower bound computation and graph reduction. Based on this rule, we develop a novel method called FastColor, which also exploits fast clique and coloring heuristics. We carry out experiments to compare our method FastColor with two best algorithms for coloring large graphs we could find. Experiments on a broad range of real world large graphs show the superiority of our method. Additionally, our method maintains both upper bound and lower bound on the optimal solution, and thus it proves an optimal solution when the upper bound meets the lower bound. In our experiments, it proves the optimal solution for 97 out of 142 instances.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/73	Jinkun Lin, Shaowei Cai, Chuan Luo, Kaile Su
Online Bridged Pruning for Real-Time Search with Arbitrary Lookaheads	Real-time search algorithms are relevant to time-sensitive decision-making domains such as video games and robotics. In such settings, the agent is required to decide on each action under a constant time bound, regardless of the search space size. Despite recent progress, poor-quality solutions can be produced mainly due to state re-visitation. Different techniques have been developed to reduce such a re-visitation with state pruning showing promise. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning approach applicable to the wide class of real-time search algorithms. Given a local search space of arbitrary size, our technique aggressively prunes away all states in its interior, possibly adding new edges to maintain the connectivity of the search space frontier. An experimental evaluation shows that our pruning often improves the performance of a base real-time search algorithm by over an order of magnitude. This allows our implemented system to outperform state-of-the-art real-time search algorithms used in the evaluation.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/72	Carlos Hernandez, Adi Botea, Jorge A.

A Random Model for Argumentation Framework: Phase Transitions, Empirical Hardness, and Heuristics	We propose and study, theoretically and empirically, a new random model for the abstract argumentation framework (AF). Our model overcomes some intrinsic difficulties of the only random model of directed graphs in the literature that is relevant to AFs, and makes it possible to study the typical-case complexity of AF instances in terms of threshold behaviours and phase transitions. We proved that the probability for a random AF instance to have a stable/preferred extension goes through a sudden change (from 1 to 0) at the threshold of the parameters of the new model D(n, p, q), satisfying the equation 4q/((1 + q)(1+q)) = p. We showed, empirically, that in this new model, there is a clear easy-hard-easy pattern of hardness (for a typical backtracking-style exact solvers) associated with the phase transition. Our empirical studies indicated that instances from the new model at phase transitions are much harder than those from an Erdos-Renyi-style model with equal edge density. In addition to being an analytically tractable model for understanding the interplay between problems structures and effectiveness of (branching) heuristics used in practical argumentation solvers, the model can also be used to generate, in a systematic way, non-trivial AF instances with controlled features to evaluate the performance of other AF solvers.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/71	Yong Gao
Compromise-free Pathfinding on a Navigation Mesh	We want to compute geometric shortest paths in a collection of convex traversable polygons, also known as a navigation mesh. Simple to compute and easy to update, navigation meshes are widely used for pathfinding in computer games. When the mesh is static, shortest path problems can be solved exactly and very fast but only after a costly preprocessing step. When the mesh is dynamic, practitioners turn to online methods which typically compute only approximately shortest paths. In this work we present a new pathfinding algorithm which is compromise-free; i.e. it is simultaneously fast, online and optimal. Our method, Polyanya, extends and generalises Anya; a recent and related interval-based search technique developed for computing geometric shortest paths in grids. We show how that algorithm can be modified to support search over arbitrary sets of convex polygons and then evaluate its performance on a range of realistic and synthetic benchmark problems.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/70	Michael Cui, Daniel D.

Front-to-End Bidirectional Heuristic Search with Near-Optimal Node Expansions	"It is well-known that any admissible unidirectional heuristic search algorithm must expand all states whose f-value is smaller than the optimal solution cost when using a consistent heuristic. Such states are called ""surely expanded"" (s.e.). A recent study characterized s.e. pairs of states for bidirectional search with consistent heuristics: if a pair of states is s.e. then at least one of the two states must be expanded. This paper derives a lower bound, VC, on the minimum number of expansions required to cover all s.e. pairs, and present a new admissible front-to-end bidirectional heuristic search algorithm, Near-Optimal Bidirectional Search (NBS), that is guaranteed to do no more than 2VC expansions. We further prove that no admissible front-to-end algorithm has a worst case better than 2VC. Experimental results show that NBS competes with or outperforms existing bidirectional search algorithms, and often outperforms A* as well."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/69	Jingwei Chen, Robert C.

An Admissible HTN Planning Heuristic	Hierarchical task network (HTN) planning is well-known for being an efficient planning approach. This is mainly due to the success of the HTN planning system SHOP2. However, its performance depends on hand-designed search control knowledge. At the time being, there are only very few domain-independent heuristics, which are designed for differing hierarchical planning formalisms. Here, we propose an admissible heuristic for standard HTN planning, which allows to find optimal solutions heuristically. It bases upon the so-called task decomposition graph (TDG), a data structure reflecting reachable parts of the task hierarchy. We show (both in theory and empirically) that rebuilding it during planning can improve heuristic accuracy thereby decreasing the explored search space. The evaluation further studies the heuristic both in terms of plan quality and coverage.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/68	Pascal Bercher, Gregor Behnke, Daniel Höller, Susanne Biundo
Estimating the size of search trees by sampling with domain knowledge	We show how recently-defined abstract models of the Branch-and-Bound algorithm can be used to obtain information on how the nodes are distributed in B&B search trees. This can be directly exploited in the form of probabilities in a sampling algorithm given by Knuth that estimates the size of a search tree. This method reduces the offline estimation error by a factor of two on search trees from Mixed-Integer Programming instances.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/67	Gleb Belov, Samuel Esler, Dylan Fernando, Pierre Le Bodic, George L.

How to Form Winning Coalitions in Mixed Human-Computer Settings	Despite the prevalence of weighted voting in the real world, there has been relatively little work studying real people's behavior in such settings. This paper proposes a new negotiation game, based on the weighted voting paradigm in cooperative games, where players need to form coalitions and agree on how to share the gains. We show that solution concepts from cooperative game theory (in particular, an extension of the Deegan-Packel Index) provide a good prediction of people's decisions to join a given coalition. With this insight in mind, we design an agent that combines predictive analytics with decision theory to make offers to people in the game. We show that the agent was able to obtain higher shares from coalitions than did people playing other people, without reducing the acceptance rate of its offers. These results demonstrate the potential of incorporating concepts from cooperative game theory in the design of negotiating agents.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/66	Yair Zick, Kobi Gal, Yoram Bachrach, Moshe Mash
Agent Design Consistency Checking via Planning	In this work we present a novel approach to check the consistency of agent designs (prior to any implementation) with respect to the requirements specifications via automated planning. This checking is essentially a search problem which makes planning technology an appropriate solution. We focus our work on BDI agent systems and the Prometheus design methodology in order to directly compare our approach to previous work. Our experiments in more than 16K random instances prove that the approach is more effective than previous ones proposed: it achieves higher coverage, lower run-time, and importantly, can handle loops in the agent detailed design and unbounded subgoal reasoning.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/65	Nitin Yadav, John Thangarajah, Sebastian Sardina
Score Aggregation via Spectral Method	The score aggregation problem is to find an aggregate scoring over all candidates given individual scores provided by different agents. This is a fundamental problem with a broad range of applications in social choice and many other areas. The simple and commonly used method is to sum up all scores of each candidate, which is called the sum-up method. In this paper, we give good algebraic and geometric explanations for score aggregation, and develop a spectral method for it. If we view the original scores as `noise data', our method can find an `optimal' aggregate scoring by minimizing the `noise information'. We also suggest a signal-to-noise indicator to evaluate the validity of the aggregation or the consistency of the agents.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/64	Mingyu Xiao, Yuqing Wang
Multi-Agent Planning with Baseline Regret Minimization	We propose a novel baseline regret minimization algorithm for multi-agent planning problems modeled as finite-horizon decentralized POMDPs. It guarantees to produce a policy that is provably better than or at least equivalent to the baseline policy. We also propose an iterative belief generation algorithm to effectively and efficiently minimize the baseline regret, which only requires necessary iterations to converge to the policy with minimum baseline regret. Experimental results on common benchmark problems confirm its advantage comparing to the state-of-the-art approaches.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/63	Feng Wu, Shlomo Zilberstein, Xiaoping Chen
Manipulating Gale-Shapley Algorithm: Preserving Stability and Remaining Inconspicuous	We study the problem of manipulation of the men-proposing Gale-Shapley algorithm by a single woman via permutation of her true preference list. Our contribution is threefold: First, we show that the matching induced by an optimal manipulation is stable with respect to the true preferences. Second, we identify a class of optimal manipulations called inconspicuous manipulations which, in addition to preserving stability, are also nearly identical to the true preference list of the manipulator (making the manipulation hard to be detected). Third, for optimal inconspicuous manipulations, we strengthen the stability result by showing that the entire stable lattice of the manipulated instance is contained inside the original lattice.​	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/62	Rohit Vaish, Dinesh Garg
On the Power and Limitations of Deception in Multi-Robot Adversarial Patrolling	Multi-robot adversarial patrolling is a well studied problem, investigating how defenders can optimally use all given resources for maximizing the probability of detecting penetrations, that are controlled by an adversary. It is commonly assumed that the adversary in this problem is rational, thus uses the knowledge it has on the patrolling robots (namely, the number of robots, their location, characteristics and strategy) to optimize its own chances to penetrate successfully. In this paper we present a novel defending approach which manipulates the adversarial (possibly partial) knowledge on the patrolling robots, so that it will believe the robots have more power than they actually have. We describe two different ways of deceiving the adversary: Window Deception, in which it is assumed that the adversary has partial observability of the perimeter, and Scarecrow Deception, in which some of the patrolling robots only appear as real robots, though they have no ability to actually detect the adversary. We analyze the limitations of both models, and suggest a random-based approach for optimally deceiving the adversary that considers both the resources of the defenders, and the adversarial knowledge.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/61	Noga Talmor, Noa Agmon
Online Optimization of Video-Ad Allocation	In this paper, we study the video advertising in the context of internet advertising. Video advertising is a rapidly growing industry, but its computational aspects have not yet been investigated. A difference between video advertising and traditional display advertising is that the former requires more time to be viewed. In contrast to a traditional display advertisement, a video advertisement has no influence over a user unless the user watches it for a certain amount of time. Previous studies have not considered the length of video advertisements, and time spent by users to watch them. Motivated by this observation, we formulate a new online optimization problem for optimizing the allocation of video advertisements, and we develop a nearly (1 − 1/e)-competitive algorithm for finding an envy-free allocation of video advertisements.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/60	Hanna Sumita, Yasushi Kawase, Sumio Fujita, Takuro Fukunaga
Attachment Centrality for Weighted Graphs	Measuring how central nodes are in terms of connecting a network has recently received increasing attention in the literature. While a few dedicated centrality measures have been proposed, Skibski et al. [2016] showed that the Attachment Centrality is the only one that satisfies certain natural axioms desirable for connectivity. Unfortunately, the Attachment Centrality is defined only for unweighted graphs which makes this measure ill-fitted for various applications. For instance, covert networks are typically weighted, where the weights carry additional intelligence available about criminals or terrorists and the links between them. To analyse such settings, in this paper we extend the Attachment Centrality to node-weighted and edge-weighted graphs. By an axiomatic analysis, we show that the Attachment Centrality is closely related to the Degree Centrality in weighted graphs.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/59	Jadwiga Sosnowska, Oskar Skibski
Proportional Rankings	We extend the principle of proportional representation to rankings: given approval preferences, we aim to generate aggregate rankings so that cohesive groups of voters are represented proportionally in each initial segment of the ranking. Such rankings are desirable in situations where initial segments of different lengths may be relevant, e.g., in recommender systems, for hiring decisions, or for the presentation of competing proposals on a liquid democracy platform. We define what it means for rankings to be proportional, provide bounds for well-known aggregation rules, and experimentally evaluate the performance of these rules.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/58	Piotr Skowron, Martin Lackner, Markus Brill, Dominik Peters, Edith Elkind
Synchronisation Games on Hypergraphs	We study a strategic game model on hypergraphs where players, modelled by nodes, try to coordinate or anti-coordinate their choices within certain groups of players, modelled by hyperedges. We show this model to be a strict generalisation of symmetric additively separable hedonic games to the hypergraph setting and that such games always have a pure Nash equilibrium, which can be computed in pseudo-polynomial time. Moreover, in the pure coordination setting, we show that a strong equilibrium exists and can be computed in polynomial time when the game possesses a certain acyclic structure.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/57	Sunil Simon, Dominik Wojtczak
Why You Should Charge Your Friends for Borrowing Your Stuff	We consider goods that can be shared with k-hop neighbors (i.e., the set of nodes within k hops from an owner) on a social network. We examine incentives to buy such a good by devising game-theoretic models where each node decides whether to buy the good or free ride. First, we find that social inefficiency, specifically excessive purchase of the good, occurs in Nash equilibria. Second, the social inefficiency decreases as k increases and thus a good can be shared with more nodes. Third, and most importantly, the social inefficiency can also be significantly reduced by charging free riders an access cost and paying it to owners, leading to the conclusion that organizations and system designers should impose such a cost. These findings are supported by our theoretical analysis in terms of the price of anarchy and the price of stability; and by simulations based on synthetic and real social networks.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/56	Kijung Shin, Euiwoong Lee, Dhivya Eswaran, Ariel D.

Posted Pricing sans Discrimination	"In the quest for market mechanisms that are easy to implement, yet close to optimal, few seem as viable as posted pricing. Despite the growing body of impressive results, the performance of most posted price mechanisms however, rely crucially on ""price discrimination"" when multiple copies of a good are available. For the more general case with non-linear production costs on each good, hardly anything is known for general multi-good markets. With this in mind, we study the problem of social welfare maximization in a Bayesian setting where the seller can produce any number of copies of a good but faces convex production costs for the same. Our central contribution is a structured framework for decision making and static item pricing in the face of uncertainty and production costs, i.e., the seller decides how much to produce and posts a single price per good that is common to all buyers, the buyers arrive sequentially and purchase utility maximizing bundles of goods. The framework yields constant factor approximations to the optimum welfare when buyer valuations are fractionally subadditive, extends to more general valuations and also settings where the seller is completely oblivious to buyer valuations. Our work presents the first known results for non-discriminatory pricing in environments with non-linear costs where we only have access to stochastic information regarding buyer preferences. At a high level, our results imply that it is often possible to obtain good guarantees without discriminating against buyers, i.e., charging them differently for the same good."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/55	Shreyas Sekar
Don't Bury your Head in Warnings: A Game-Theoretic Approach for Intelligent Allocation of Cyber-security Alerts	In recent years, there have been a number of successful cyber attacks on enterprise networks by malicious actors which have caused severe damage. These networks have Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems in place to protect them, but they are notorious for producing a high volume of alerts. These alerts must be investigated by cyber analysts to determine whether they are an attack or benign. Unfortunately, there are magnitude more alerts generated than there are cyber analysts to investigate them. This trend is expected to continue into the future creating a need for tools which find optimal assignments of the incoming alerts to analysts in the presence of a strategic adversary. We address this challenge with the four following contributions: (1) a cyber screening game (CSG) model for the cyber network protection domain, (2) an NP-hardness proof for computing the optimal strategy for the defender, (3) an algorithm that finds the optimal allocation of experts to alerts in the CSG, and (4) heuristic improvements for computing allocations in CSGs that accomplishes significant scale-up which we show empirically to closely match the solution quality of the optimal algorithm.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/54	Aaron Schlenker, Haifeng Xu, Mina Guirguis, Christopher Kiekintveld, Arunesh Sinha, Milind Tambe, Solomon Sonya, Darryl Balderas, Noah Dunstatter
Enhancing Sustainability of Complex Epidemiological Models through a Generic Multilevel Agent-based Approach	The development of computational sciences has fostered major advances in life sciences, but also led to reproducibility and reliability issues, which become a crucial stake when simulations are aimed at assessing control measures, as in epidemiology. A broad use of software development methods is a useful remediation to reduce those problems, but preventive approaches, targeting not only implementation but also model design, are essential to sustainable enhancements. Among them, AI techniques, based on the separation between declarative and procedural concerns, and on knowledge engineering, offer promising solutions. Especially, multilevel multi-agent systems, deeply rooted in that culture, provide a generic way to integrate several epidemiological modeling paradigms within a homogeneous interface. We explain in this paper how this approach is used for building more generic, reliable and sustainable simulations, illustrated by real-case applications in cattle epidemiology.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/53	Sébastien Picault, Yu-Lin Huang, Vianney Sicard, Pauline Ezanno
Multiple-Profile Prediction-of-Use Games	Prediction-of-use (POU) games (Robu et al., 2017) address the mismatch between energy supplier costs and the incentives imposed on consumers by a fixed-rate electricity tariff. However, the framework does not address how consumers should coordinate to maximize social welfare. To address this, we develop MPOU games, an extension of POU games in which agents report multiple acceptable electricity use profiles. We show that MPOU games share many attractive properties with POU games (e.g., convexity). Despite this, MPOU games introduce new incentive issues that prevent the consequences of convexity from being exploited directly, a problem we analyze and resolve. We validate our approach with experimental results using utility models learned from real electricity use data.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/52	Andrew Perrault, Craig Boutilier
Core Stability in Hedonic Games among Friends and Enemies: Impact of Neutrals	We investigate hedonic games under enemies aversion and friends appreciation, where every agent considers other agents as either a friend or an enemy. We extend these simple preferences by allowing each agent to also consider other agents to be neutral. Neutrals have no impact on her preference, as in a graphical hedonic game.Surprisingly, we discover that neutral agents do not simplify matters, but cause complexity. We prove that the core can be empty under enemies aversion and the strict core can be empty under friends appreciation. Furthermore, we show that under both preferences, deciding whether the strict core is non-empty, is NP^NP-complete. This complexity extends to the core under enemies aversion. We also show that under friends appreciation, we can always find a core stable coalition structure in polynomial time.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/51	Kazunori Ohta, Nathanaël Barrot, Anisse Ismaili, Yuko Sakurai, Makoto Yokoo
Deterministic, Strategyproof, and Fair Cake Cutting	We study the classic cake cutting problem from a mechanism design perspective, in particular focusing on deterministic mechanisms that are strategyproof and fair. We begin by looking at mechanisms that are non-wasteful and primarily show that for even the restricted class of piecewise constant valuations there exists no direct-revelation mechanism that is strategyproof and even approximately proportional. Subsequently, we remove the non-wasteful constraint and show another impossibility result stating that there is no strategyproof and approximately proportional direct-revelation mechanism that outputs contiguous allocations, again, for even the restricted class of piecewise constant valuations. In addition to the above results, we also present some negative results when considering an approximate notion of strategyproofness, show a connection between direct-revelation mechanisms and mechanisms in the Robertson-Webb model when agents have piecewise constant valuations, and finally also present a (minor) modification to the well-known Even-Paz algorithm that has better incentive-compatible properties for the cases when there are two or three agents.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/50	Vijay Menon, Kate Larson
Mechanisms for Online Organ Matching	Matching donations from deceased patients to patients on the waiting list account for over 85\% of all kidney transplants performed in Australia. We propose a simple mechanisms to perform this matching and compare this new mechanism with the more complex algorithm currently under consideration by the Organ and Tissue Authority in Australia. We perform a number of experiments using real world data provided by the Organ and Tissue Authority of Australia. We find that our simple mechanism is more efficient and fairer in practice compared to the other mechanism currently under consideration.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/49	Nicholas Mattei, Abdallah Saffidine, Toby Walsh
Computing an Approximately Optimal Agreeable Set of Items	We study the problem of finding a small subset of items that is agreeable to all agents, meaning that all agents value the subset at least as much as its complement. Previous work has shown worst-case bounds, over all instances with a given number of agents and items, on the number of items that may need to be included in such a subset. Our goal in this paper is to efficiently compute an agreeable subset whose size approximates the size of the smallest agreeable subset for a given instance. We consider three well-known models for representing the preferences of the agents: ordinal preferences on single items, the value oracle model, and additive utilities. In each of these models, we establish virtually tight bounds on the approximation ratio that can be obtained by algorithms running in polynomial time.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/48	Pasin Manurangsi, Warut Suksompong
Probability Bounds for Overlapping Coalition Formation	In this work, we provide novel methods which benefit from obtained probability bounds for assessing the ability of teams of agents to accomplish coalitional tasks. To this end, our first method is based on an improvement of the Paley-Zygmund inequality, while the second and the third ones are devised based on manipulations of the two-sided Chebyshev's inequality and the Hoeffding's inequality, respectively. Agents have no knowledge of the amount of resources others possess; and hold private Bayesian beliefs regarding the potential resource investment of every other agent. Our methods allow agents to demand that certain confidence levels are reached, regarding the resource contributions of the various coalitions. In order to tackle real-world scenarios, we allow agents to form overlapping coalitions, so that one can simultaneously be part of a number of coalitions. We thus present a protocol for iterated overlapping coalition formation (OCF), through which agents can complete tasks that grant them utility. Agents lie on a social network and their distance affects their likelihood of cooperation towards the completion of a task. We confirm our methods' effectiveness by testing them on both a random graph of 300 nodes and a real-world social network of 4039 nodes.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/47	Michail Mamakos, Georgios Chalkiadakis
Recognizing Top-Monotonic Preference Profiles in Polynomial Time	We provide the first polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing if a profile of (possibly weak) preference orders is top-monotonic. Top-monotonicity is a generalization of the notions of single-peakedness and single-crossingness, defined by Barbera and Moreno. Top-monotonic profiles always have weak Condorcet winners and satisfy a variant of the median voter theorem. Our algorithm proceeds by reducing the recognition problem to the SAT-2CNF problem.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/46	Krzysztof Magiera, Piotr Faliszewski
Crowd Learning: Improving Online Decision Making Using Crowdsourced Data	We analyze an online learning problem that arises in crowdsourcing systems for users facing crowdsourced data: a user at each discrete time step t can choose K out of a total of N options (bandits), and receives randomly generated rewards dependent on user-specific and option-specific statistics unknown to the user. Each user aims to maximize her expected total rewards over a certain time horizon through a sequence of exploration and exploitation steps. Different from the typical regret/bandit learning setting, in this case a user may also exploit crowdsourced information to augment her learning process, i.e., other users' choices or rewards from using these options. We consider two scenarios, one in which only their choices are shared, and the other in which users share full information including their choices and subsequent rewards. In both cases we derive bounds on the weak regret, the difference between the user's expected total reward and the reward from a user-specific best single-action policy; and show how they improve over their individual-learning counterpart. We also evaluate the performance of our algorithms using simulated data as well as the real-world movie ratings dataset MovieLens.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/45	Yang Liu, Mingyan Liu
Representativeness-aware Aspect Analysis for Brand Monitoring in Social Media	Owing to the fast-responding nature and extreme success of social media, many companies resort to social media sites for monitoring their brands' reputation and the opinions of general public. To help companies monitor their brands, in this work, we delve into the task of extracting representative aspects and posts from users' free-text posts in social media. Previous efforts have treated it as a traditional information extraction task, and forgo the specific properties of social media, such as the possible noise in user generated posts and the varying impacts; In contrast, we extract aspects by maximizing their representativeness, which is a new notion defined by us that accounts for both the coverage of aspects and the impact of posts. We formalize it as a submodular optimization problem, and develop a FastPAS algorithm to jointly select representative posts and aspects. The FastPAS algorithm optimizes parameters in a greedy way, which is highly efficient and can reach a good solution with theoretical guarantees. We perform extensive experiments on two datasets, showing that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art aspect extraction and summarization methods in identifying representative aspects.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/44	Lizi Liao, Xiangnan He, Zhaochun Ren, Liqiang Nie, Huan Xu, Tat-Seng Chua
Contest Design with Uncertain Performance and Costly Participation	This paper studies the problem of designing contests for settings where a principal seeks to optimize the quality of the best performance obtained, and potential contestants only strategize about whether to participate in the contest, as participation incurs some cost. This type of contest can be mapped to various real-life settings (e.g., an audition, a beauty pageant, technology crowdsourcing). The paper provides a comparative game-theoretic based solution to two variants of the above underlying model: parallel and sequential contest, enabling a characterization of the equilibrium strategies in each. Special emphasis is placed on the case where the contestants are homogeneous which is often the case in real-life whenever the contestants are basically alike and their ranking in the contest is mostly influenced by some probabilistic factors (e.g., luck). Here, several (somehow counter-intuitive) properties of the equilibrium are proved, in particular for the sequential contest, leading to a comprehensive characterization of the principal preference between the two.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/43	Priel Levy, David Sarne, Igor Rochlin
Smoothing Method for Approximate Extensive-Form Perfect Equilibrium	Nash equilibrium is a popular solution concept for solving imperfect-information games in practice. However, it has a major drawback: it does not preclude suboptimal play in branches of the game tree that are not reached in equilibrium. Equilibrium refinements can mend this issue, but have experienced little practical adoption. This is largely due to a lack of scalable algorithms.Sparse iterative methods, in particular first-order methods, are known to be among the most effective algorithms for computing Nash equilibria in large-scale two-player zero-sum extensive-form games. In this paper, we provide, to our knowledge, the first extension of these methods to equilibrium refinements. We develop a smoothing approach for behavioral perturbations of the convex polytope that encompasses the strategy spaces of players in an extensive-form game. This enables one to compute an approximate variant of extensive-form perfect equilibria. Experiments show that our smoothing approach leads to solutions with dramatically stronger strategies at information sets that are reached with low probability in approximate Nash equilibria, while retaining the overall convergence rate associated with fast algorithms for Nash equilibrium. This has benefits both in approximate equilibrium finding (such approximation is necessary in practice in large games) where some probabilities are low while possibly heading toward zero in the limit, and exact equilibrium computation where the low probabilities are actually zero.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/42	Christian Kroer, Gabriele Farina, Tuomas Sandholm
Verifying Fault-tolerance in Parameterised Multi-Agent Systems	We develop a technique to evaluate the fault-tolerance of a multi-agent system whose number of agents is unknown at design time. We present a method for injecting a variety of non-ideal behaviours, or faults, studied in the safety-analysis literature into the abstract agent templates that are used to generate an unbounded family of multi-agent systems with different sizes. We define the parameterised fault-tolerance problem as the decision problem of establishing whether any concrete system, in which the ratio of faulty versus non-faulty agents is under a given threshold, satisfies a given temporal-epistemic specification. We put forward a sound and complete technique for solving the problem for the semantical set-up considered. We present an implementation and a case study identifying the threshold under which the alpha swarm aggregation algorithm is robust to faults against its temporal-epistemic specifications.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/41	Panagiotis Kouvaros, Alessio Lomuscio
Constraint-Based Symmetry Detection in General Game Playing	Symmetry detection is a promising approach for reducing the search tree of games. In General Game Playing (GGP), where any game is compactly represented by a set of rules in the Game Description Language (GDL), the state-of-the-art methods for symmetry detection rely on a rule graph associated with the GDL description of the game. Though such rule-based symmetry detection methods can be applied to various tree search algorithms, they cover only a limited number of symmetries which are apparent in the GDL description. In this paper, we develop an alternative approach to symmetry detection in stochastic games that exploits constraint programming techniques. The minimax optimization problem in a GDL game is cast as a stochastic constraint satisfaction problem (SCSP), which can be viewed as a sequence of one-stage SCSPs. Minimax symmetries are inferred according to themicrostructure complement of these one-stage constraint networks. Based on a theoretical analysis of this approach, we experimentally show on various games that the recent stochastic constraint solver MAC-UCB, coupled with constraint-based symmetry detection, significantly outperforms the standard Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms, coupled with rule-based symmetry detection. This constraint-driven approach is also validated by the excellent results obtained by our player during the last GGP competition.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/40	Frédéric Koriche, Sylvain Lagrue, Éric Piette, Sébastien Tabary
Convergence and Quality of Iterative Voting Under Non-Scoring Rules	Iterative voting is a social choice mechanism that assumes all voters are strategic, and allows voters to change their stated preferences as the vote progresses until an equilibrium is reached (at which point no player wishes to change their vote). Previous research established that this process converges to an equilibrium for the plurality and veto voting methods and for no other scoring rule. We consider iterative voting for non-scoring rules, examining the major ones, and show that none of them converge when assuming (as most research has so far) that voters pursue a best response strategy. We investigate other potential voter strategies, with a more heuristic flavor (since for most of these voting rules, calculating the best response is NP-hard); we show that they also do not converge. We then conduct an empirical analysis of the iterative voting winners for these non-scoring rules, and compare the winner quality of various strategies.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/39	Aaron Koolyk, Tyrone Strangway, Omer Lev, Jeffrey S.

Omniscient Debugging for Cognitive Agent Programs	For real-time programs reproducing a bug by rerunning the system is likely to fail, making fault localization a time-consuming process. Omniscient debugging is a technique that stores each run in such a way that it supports going backwards in time. However, the overhead of existing omniscient debugging implementations for languages like Java is so large that it cannot be effectively used in practice. In this paper, we show that for agent-oriented programming practical omniscient debugging is possible. We design a tracing mechanism for efficiently storing and exploring agent program runs. We are the first to demonstrate that this mechanism does not affect program runs by empirically establishing that the same tests succeed or fail. Usability is supported by a trace visualization method aimed at more effectively locating faults in agent programs.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/38	Vincent J. Koeman, Koen V.

Tosca: Operationalizing Commitments Over Information Protocols	The notion of commitment is widely studied as a high-level abstraction for modeling multiagent interaction. An important challenge is supporting flexible decentralized enactments of commitment specifications. In this paper, we combine recent advances on specifying commitments and information protocols. Specifically, we contribute Tosca, a technique for automatically synthesizing information protocols from commitment specifications. Our main result is that the synthesized protocols support commitment alignment, which is the idea that agents must make compatible inferences about their commitments despite decentralization.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/37	Thomas C.

A Bayesian Approach to Argument-Based Reasoning for Attack Estimation	The web is a source of a large amount of arguments and their acceptability statuses (e.g., votes for and against the arguments). However, relations existing between the fore-mentioned arguments are typically not available. This study investigates the utilisation of acceptability semantics to statistically estimate an attack relation between arguments wherein the acceptability statuses of arguments are provided. A Bayesian network model of argument-based reasoning is defined in which Dung's theory of abstract argumentation gives the substance of Bayesian inference. The model correctness is demonstrated by analysing properties of estimated attack relations and illustrating its applicability to online forums.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/36	Hiroyuki Kido, Keishi Okamoto
Near-Feasible Stable Matchings with Budget Constraints	"This paper deals with two-sided matching with budget constraints where one side (firm or hospital) can make monetary transfers (offer wages) to the other (worker or doctor). In a standard model, while multiple doctors can be matched to a single hospital, a hospital has a maximum quota: the number of doctors assigned to a hospital cannot exceed a certain limit. In our model, a hospital instead has a fixed budget: the total amount of wages allocated by each hospital to doctors is constrained. With budget constraints, stable matchings may fail to exist and checking the existence is hard. To deal with the nonexistence of stable matchings, we extend the ""matching with contracts"" model by Hatfield and Milgrom, so that it handles near-feasible matchings that exceeds each budget of the hospitals by a certain amount. We then propose two novel mechanisms that efficiently return such a near-feasible matching that is stable with respect to the actual amount of wages allocated by each hospital. In particular, by sacrificing strategy-proofness, our second mechanism achieves the best possible bound."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/35	Yasushi Kawase, Atsushi Iwasaki
Online Roommate Allocation Problem	We study the online allocation problem under a roommate market model introduced in [Chan et al., 2016]. Consider a fixed supply of n rooms and a list of 2n applicants arriving sequentially in an online fashion. The problem is to assign a room to each person upon her arrival, such that after the algorithm terminates, each room is shared by exactly two people. We focus on two objectives: (1) maximizing the social welfare, which is defined as the sum of valuations that applicants have for their rooms, plus the happiness value between each pair of roommates; (2) the allocation should satisfy certain stability conditions, such that no group of people would be willing to switch roommates or rooms. We first show a polynomial-time online algorithm that achieves constant competitive ratio for social welfare maximization. We then extend it to the case where each room is assigned to c > 2 people, and achieve a competitive ratio of Ω(1/c^2). Finally, we show both positive and negative results in satisfying different stability conditions in this online setting.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/34	Guangda Huzhang, Xin Huang, Shengyu Zhang, Xiaohui Bei
Optimal Posted-Price Mechanism in Microtask Crowdsourcing	Posted-price mechanisms are widely-adopted to decide the price of tasks in popular microtask crowdsourcing. In this paper, we propose a novel posted-price mechanism which not only outperforms existing mechanisms on performance but also avoids their need of a finite price range. The advantages are achieved by converting the pricing problem into a multi-armed bandit problem and designing an optimal algorithm to exploit the unique features of microtask crowdsourcing. We theoretically show the optimality of our algorithm and prove that the performance upper bound can be achieved without the need of a prior price range. We also conduct extensive experiments using real price data to verify the advantages and practicability of our mechanism.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/33	Zehong Hu, Jie Zhang
The Off-Switch Game	It is clear that one of the primary tools we can use to mitigate the potential risk from a misbehaving AI system is the ability to turn the system off. As the capabilities of AI systems improve, it is important to ensure that such systems do not adopt subgoals that prevent a human from switching the system off. This is a challenge because many formulations of rational agents create strong incentives for self-preservation. This is not caused by a built-in instinct, but because a rational agent will maximize expected utility and cannot achieve whatever objective it has been given if it is dead. Our goal is to study the incentives an agent has to allow itself to be switched off. We analyze a simple game between a human H and a robot R, where H can press R's off switch but R can disable the off switch. A traditional agent takes its reward function for granted: we show that such agents have an incentive to disable the off switch, except in the special case where H is perfectly rational. Our key insight is that for R to want to preserve its off switch, it needs to be uncertain about the utility associated with the outcome, and to treat H's actions as important observations about that utility. (R also has no incentive to switch itself off in this setting.) We conclude that giving machines an appropriate level of uncertainty about their objectives leads to safer designs, and we argue that this setting is a useful generalization of the classical AI paradigm of rational agents.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/32	Dylan Hadfield-Menell, Anca Dragan, Pieter Abbeel, Stuart Russell
Object Allocation via Swaps along a Social Network	This article deals with object allocation where each agent receives a single item. Starting from an initial endowment, the agents can be better off by exchanging their objects. However, not all trades are likely because some participants are unable to communicate. By considering that the agents are embedded in a social network, we propose to study the allocations emerging from a sequence of simple swaps between pairs of neighbors in the network. This model raises natural questions regarding (i) the reachability of a given assignment, (ii) the ability of an agent to obtain a given object, and (iii) the search of Pareto-efficient allocations. We investigate the complexity of these problems by providing, according to the structure of the social network, polynomial and NP-complete cases.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/31	Laurent Gourvès, Julien Lesca, Anaëlle Wilczynski
A Novel Symbolic Approach to Verifying Epistemic Properties of Programs	We introduce a framework for the symbolic verification of epistemic properties of programs expressed in a class of general-purpose programming languages. To this end, we reduce the verification problem to that of satisfiability of first-order formulae in appropriate theories. We prove the correctness of our reduction and we validate our proposal by applying it to two examples: the dining cryptographers problem and the ThreeBallot voting protocol. We put forward an implementation using existing solvers, and report experimental results showing that the approach can perform better than state-of-the-art symbolic model checkers for temporal-epistemic logic.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/30	Nikos Gorogiannis, Franco Raimondi, Ioana Boureanu
Operation Frames and Clubs in Kidney Exchange	A kidney exchange is a centrally-administered barter market where patients swap their willing yet incompatible donors. Modern kidney exchanges use 2-cycles, 3-cycles, and chains initiated by non-directed donors (altruists who are willing to give a kidney to anyone) as the means for swapping. We propose significant generalizations to kidney exchange. We allow more than one donor to donate in exchange for their desired patient receiving a kidney. We also allow for the possibility of a donor willing to donate if any of a number of patients receive kidneys. Furthermore, we combine these notions and generalize them. The generalization is to exchange among organ clubs, where a club is willing to donate organs outside the club if and only if the club receives organs from outside the club according to given specifications. We prove that unlike in the standard model, the uncapped clearing problem is NP-complete. We also present the notion of operation frames that can be used to sequence the operations across batches, and present integer programming formulations for the market clearing problems for these new types of organ exchanges. Experiments show that in the single-donation setting, operation frames improve planning by 34% - 51%. Allowing up to two donors to donate in exchange for one kidney donated to their designated patient yields a further increase in social welfare.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/29	Gabriele Farina, John P.

Multiwinner Rules on Paths From k-Borda to Chamberlin–Courant	The classical multiwinner rules are designed for particular purposes. For example, variants of k-Borda are used to find k best competitors in judging contests while the Chamberlin-Courant rule is used to select a diverse set of k products. These rules represent two extremes of the multiwinner world. At times, however, one might need to find an appropriate trade-off between these two extremes. We explore continuous transitions from k-Borda to Chamberlin-Courant and study intermediate rules.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/28	Piotr Faliszewski, Piotr Skowron, Arkadii Slinko, Nimrod Talmon
Interaction-based ontology alignment repair with expansion and relaxation	Agents may use ontology alignments to communicate when they represent knowledge with different ontologies: alignments help reclassifying objects from one ontology to the other. These alignments may not be perfectly correct, yet agents have to proceed. They can take advantage of their experience in order to evolve alignments: upon communication failure, they will adapt the alignments to avoid reproducing the same mistake. Such repair experiments had been performed in the framework of networks of ontologies related by alignments. They revealed that, by playing simple interaction games, agents can effectively repair random networks of ontologies. Here we repeat these experiments and, using new measures, show that previous results were underestimated. We introduce new adaptation operators that improve those previously considered. We also allow agents to go beyond the initial operators in two ways: they can generate new correspondences when they discard incorrect ones, and they can provide less precise answers. The combination of these modalities satisfy the following properties: (1) Agents still converge to a state in which no mistake occurs. (2) They achieve results far closer to the correct alignments than previously found. (3) They reach again 100\% precision and coherent alignments.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/27	Jérôme Euzenat
No Pizza for You: Value-based Plan Selection in BDI Agents	Autonomous agents are increasingly required to be able to make moral decisions. In these situations, the agent should be able to reason about the ethical bases of the decision and explain its decision in terms of the moral values involved. This is of special importance when the agent is interacting with a user and should understand the value priorities of the user in order to provide adequate support. This paper presents a model of agent behavior that takes into account user preferences and moral values.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/26	Stephen Cranefield, Michael Winikoff, Virginia Dignum, Frank Dignum
Pessimistic Leader-Follower Equilibria with Multiple Followers	The problem of computing the strategy to commit to has been widely investigated in the scientific literature for the case where a single-follower is present. In the multi-follower setting though, results are only sporadic. In this paper, we address the multi-follower case for normal-form games, assuming that, after observing the leader's commitment, the followers play pure strategies and reach a Nash equilibrium. We focus on the pessimistic case where, among many equilibria, one minimizing the leader's utility is chosen (the opposite case is computationally trivial). We show that the problem is NP-hard even with only two followers, and propose an exact exponential-time algorithm which, for any number of followers, either finds an equilibrium when the game admits a finite one or, if not, an α-approximation of the supremum of the leader' utility, for any α > 0.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/25	Stefano Coniglio, Nicola Gatti, Alberto Marchesi
Coordinated Versus Decentralized Exploration In Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits	In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent multi-armed bandit-based model for ad hoc teamwork with expensive communication. The goal of the team is to maximize the total reward gained from pulling arms of a bandit over a number of epochs. In each epoch, each agent decides whether to pull an arm, or to broadcast the reward it obtained in the previous epoch to the team and forgo pulling an arm. These decisions must be made only on the basis of the agent's private information and the public information broadcast prior to that epoch. We first benchmark the achievable utility by analyzing an idealized version of this problem where a central authority has complete knowledge of rewards acquired from all arms in all epochs and uses a multiplicative weights update algorithm for allocating arms to agents. We then introduce an algorithm for the decentralized setting that uses a value-of-information based communication strategy and an exploration-exploitation strategy based on the centralized algorithm, and show experimentally that it converges rapidly to the performance of the centralized method.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/24	Mithun Chakraborty, Kai Yee Phoebe Chua, Sanmay Das, Brendan Juba
Plan Explanations as Model Reconciliation: Moving Beyond Explanation as Soliloquy	"When AI systems interact with humans in the loop, they are often called on to provide explanations for their plans and behavior. Past work on plan explanations primarily involved the AI system explaining the correctness of its plan and the rationale for its decision in terms of its own model. Such soliloquy is wholly inadequate in most realistic scenarios where the humans have domain and task models that differ significantly from that used by the AI system. We posit that the explanations are best studied in light of these differing models. In particular, we show how explanation can be seen as a ""model reconciliation problem"" (MRP), where the AI system in effect suggests changes to the human's model, so as to make its plan be optimal with respect to that changed human model. We will study the properties of such explanations, present algorithms for automatically computing them, and evaluate the performance of the algorithms."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/23	Tathagata Chakraborti, Sarath Sreedharan, Yu Zhang, Subbarao Kambhampati
Learning a Ground Truth Ranking Using Noisy Approval Votes	We consider a voting scenario where agents have opinions that are estimates of an underlying common ground truth ranking of the available alternatives, and each agent is asked to approve a set with her most preferred alternatives. We assume that estimates are implicitly formed using the well-known Mallows model for generating random rankings. We show that k-approval voting --- where all agents are asked to approve the same number k of alternatives and the outcome is obtained by sorting the alternatives in terms of their number of approvals --- has exponential sample complexity for all values of k. This negative result suggests that an exponential (in terms of the number of alternatives m) number of agents is always necessary in order to recover the ground truth ranking with high probability. In contrast, by just asking each agent to approve a random number of alternatives, the sample complexity improves dramatically: it now depends only polynomially on m. Our results may have implications on the effectiveness of crowdsourcing applications that ask workers to provide their input by approving sets of available alternatives.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/22	Ioannis Caragiannis, Evi Micha
Bounding the Inefficiency of Compromise	Social networks on the Internet have seen an enormous growth recently and play a crucial role in different aspects of today's life. They have facilitated information dissemination in ways that have been beneficial for their users but it is also a common belief that they are often used strategically in order to spread information that only serves the objectives of particular users. These properties have inspired a revision of classical opinion formation models from sociology using game-theoretic notions and tools. We follow the same modeling approach, focusing on scenarios where the opinion expressed by each user is a compromise between her internal belief and the opinions of a small number of neighbors among her social acquaintances. We formulate simple games that capture this behavior and quantify the inefficiency of equilibria using the well-known notion of the price of anarchy. Our results indicate that compromise comes at a cost that strongly depends on the neighborhood size.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/21	Ioannis Caragiannis, Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, Alexandros A.

Fair Division of a Graph	We consider fair allocation of indivisible items under an additional constraint: there is an undirected graph describing the relationship between the items, and each agent's share must form a connected subgraph of this graph. This framework captures, e.g., fair allocation of land plots, where the graph describes the accessibility relation among the plots. We focus on agents that have additive utilities for the items, and consider several common fair division solution concepts, such as proportionality, envy-freeness and maximin share guarantee. While finding good allocations according to these solution concepts is computationally hard in general, we design efficient algorithms for special cases wherethe underlying graph has simple structure, and/or the number of agents---or, less restrictively, the number of agent types---is small. In particular, despite non-existence results in the general case, we prove that for acyclic graphs a maximin share allocation always exists and can be found efficiently.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/20	Sylvain Bouveret, Katarína Cechlárová, Edith Elkind, Ayumi Igarashi, Dominik Peters
Voting by sequential elimination with few voters	We define a new class of low-communication voting rules, tailored for contexts with few voters and possibly many candidates. These rules are defined by a predefined sequence of voters: at each stage, the designated voter eliminates a candidate, and the last remaining candidate wins. We study both deterministic (non-anonymous) variants, and randomized (and anonymous) versions of these rules. We focus on a subfamily of these rules defined by ``non-interleaved'' sequences. We first focus on the axiomatic properties of our rules. Then we focus on the identification of the non-interleaved sequence that gives the best approximation of the Borda score under the impartial culture. Finally, we apply our rules to randomly generated data. Our conclusion is that, in contexts where there are more candidates than voters, elimination-based rules allow for a very low communication complexity (and especially, avoid asking voters to rank alternatives), and yet can be good approximations of common voting rules, while enjoying a number of good properties.	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/19	Sylvain Bouveret, Yann Chevaleyre, François Durand, Jérôme Lang
From Automation to Autonomous Systems: A Legal Phenomenology with Problems of Accountability	"Over the past decades a considerable amount of work has been devoted to the notion of autonomy and the intelligence of robots and of AI systems: depending on the application, several standards on the ""levels of automation"" have been proposed. Although current AI systems may have the intelligence of a fridge, or of a toaster, some of such autonomous systems have already challenged basic pillars of society and the law, e.g. whether lethal force should ever be permitted to be ""fully automated."" The aim of this paper is to show that the normative challenges of AI entail different types of accountability that go hand-in-hand with choices of technological dependence, delegation of cognitive tasks, and trust. The stronger the social cohesion is, the higher the risks that can be socially accepted through the normative assessment of the not fully predictable consequences of tasks and decisions entrusted to AI systems and artificial agents."	https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/3	Ugo Pagallo
