3D Interpreter Networks for Viewer-Centered Wireframe Modeling.	Understanding 3D object structure from a single image is an important but challenging task in computer vision, mostly due to the lack of 3D object annotations to real images. Previous research tackled this problem by either searching for a 3D shape that best explains 2D annotations, or training purely on synthetic data with ground truth 3D information. In this work, we propose 3D INterpreter Networks (3D-INN), an end-to-end trainable framework that sequentially estimates 2D keypoint heatmaps and 3D object skeletons and poses. Our system learns from both 2D-annotated real images and synthetic 3D data. This is made possible mainly by two technical innovations. First, heatmaps of 2D keypoints serve as an intermediate representation to connect real and synthetic data. 3D-INN is trained on real images to estimate 2D keypoint heatmaps from an input image; it then predicts 3D object structure from heatmaps using knowledge learned from synthetic 3D shapes. By doing so, 3D-INN benefits from the variation and abundance of synthetic 3D objects, without suffering from the domain difference between real and synthesized images, often due to imperfect rendering. Second, we propose a Projection Layer, mapping estimated 3D structure back to 2D. During training, it ensures 3D-INN to predict 3D structure whose projection is consistent with the 2D annotations to real images. Experiments show that the proposed system performs well on both 2D keypoint estimation and 3D structure recovery. We also demonstrate that the recovered 3D information has wide vision applications, such as image retrieval.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1074-6	Jiajun Wu, Tianfan Xue, Joseph J.

"A Comprehensive Performance Evaluation of Deformable Face Tracking ""In-the-Wild""."	"Recently, technologies such as face detection, facial landmark localisation and face recognition and verification have matured enough to provide effective and efficient solutions for imagery captured under arbitrary conditions (referred to as ""in-the-wild""). This is partially attributed to the fact that comprehensive ""in-the-wild"" benchmarks have been developed for face detection, landmark localisation and recognition/verification. A very important technology that has not been thoroughly evaluated yet is deformable face tracking ""in-the-wild"". Until now, the performance has mainly been assessed qualitatively by visually assessing the result of a deformable face tracking technology on short videos. In this paper, we perform the first, to the best of our knowledge, thorough evaluation of state-of-the-art deformable face tracking pipelines using the recently introduced 300 VW benchmark. We evaluate many different architectures focusing mainly on the task of on-line deformable face tracking. In particular, we compare the following general strategies: (a) generic face detection plus generic facial landmark localisation, (b) generic model free tracking plus generic facial landmark localisation, as well as (c) hybrid approaches using state-of-the-art face detection, model free tracking and facial landmark localisation technologies. Our evaluation reveals future avenues for further research on the topic."	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-0999-5	Grigorios G.

Adaptive Correlation Filters with Long-Term and Short-Term Memory for Object Tracking.	Object tracking is challenging as target objects often undergo drastic appearance changes over time. Recently, adaptive correlation filters have been successfully applied to object tracking. However, tracking algorithms relying on highly adaptive correlation filters are prone to drift due to noisy updates. Moreover, as these algorithms do not maintain long-term memory of target appearance, they cannot recover from tracking failures caused by heavy occlusion or target disappearance in the camera view. In this paper, we propose to learn multiple adaptive correlation filters with both long-term and short-term memory of target appearance for robust object tracking. First, we learn a kernelized correlation filter with an aggressive learning rate for locating target objects precisely. We take into account the appropriate size of surrounding context and the feature representations. Second, we learn a correlation filter over a feature pyramid centered at the estimated target position for predicting scale changes. Third, we learn a complementary correlation filter with a conservative learning rate to maintain long-term memory of target appearance. We use the output responses of this long-term filter to determine if tracking failure occurs. In the case of tracking failures, we apply an incrementally learned detector to recover the target position in a sliding window fashion. Extensive experimental results on large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1076-4	Chao Ma, Jia-Bin Huang, Xiaokang Yang, Ming-Hsuan Yang
Artistic Style Transfer for Videos and Spherical Images.	Manually re-drawing an image in a certain artistic style takes a professional artist a long time. Doing this for a video sequence single-handedly is beyond imagination. We present two computational approaches that transfer the style from one image (for example, a painting) to a whole video sequence. In our first approach, we adapt to videos the original image style transfer technique by Gatys et al. based on energy minimization. We introduce new ways of initialization and new loss functions to generate consistent and stable stylized video sequences even in cases with large motion and strong occlusion. Our second approach formulates video stylization as a learning problem. We propose a deep network architecture and training procedures that allow us to stylize arbitrary-length videos in a consistent and stable way, and nearly in real time. We show that the proposed methods clearly outperform simpler baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. Finally, we propose a way to adapt these approaches also to 360^\circ images and videos as they emerge with recent virtual reality hardware.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1089-z	Manuel Ruder, Alexey Dosovitskiy, Thomas Brox
Attentive Systems: A Survey.	Visual saliency analysis detects salient regions/objects that attract human attention in natural scenes. It has attracted intensive research in different fields such as computer vision, computer graphics, and multimedia. While many such computational models exist, the focused study of what and how applications can be beneficial is still lacking. In this article, our ultimate goal is thus to provide a comprehensive review of the applications using saliency cues, the so-called attentive systems. We would like to provide a broad vision about saliency applications and what visual saliency can do. We categorize the vast amount of applications into different areas such as computer vision, computer graphics, and multimedia. Intensively covering 200+ publications we survey (1) key application trends, (2) the role of visual saliency, and (3) the usability of saliency into different tasks.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1042-6	Tam V.

Augmented Reality Meets Computer Vision: Efficient Data Generation for Urban Driving Scenes.	The success of deep learning in computer vision is based on the availability of large annotated datasets. To lower the need for hand labeled images, virtually rendered 3D worlds have recently gained popularity. Unfortunately, creating realistic 3D content is challenging on its own and requires significant human effort. In this work, we propose an alternative paradigm which combines real and synthetic data for learning semantic instance segmentation and object detection models. Exploiting the fact that not all aspects of the scene are equally important for this task, we propose to augment real-world imagery with virtual objects of the target category. Capturing real-world images at large scale is easy and cheap, and directly provides real background appearances without the need for creating complex 3D models of the environment. We present an efficient procedure to augment these images with virtual objects. In contrast to modeling complete 3D environments, our data augmentation approach requires only a few user interactions in combination with 3D models of the target object category. Leveraging our approach, we introduce a novel dataset of augmented urban driving scenes with 360 degree images that are used as environment maps to create realistic lighting and reflections on rendered objects. We analyze the significance of realistic object placement by comparing manual placement by humans to automatic methods based on semantic scene analysis. This allows us to create composite images which exhibit both realistic background appearance as well as a large number of complex object arrangements. Through an extensive set of experiments, we conclude the right set of parameters to produce augmented data which can maximally enhance the performance of instance segmentation models. Further, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach on training standard deep models for semantic instance segmentation and object detection of cars in outdoor driving scenarios. We test the models trained on our augmented data on the KITTI 2015 dataset, which we have annotated with pixel-accurate ground truth, and on the Cityscapes dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that the models trained on augmented imagery generalize better than those trained on fully synthetic data or models trained on limited amounts of annotated real data.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1070-x	Hassan Abu Alhaija, Siva Karthik Mustikovela, Lars M.

Baseline and Triangulation Geometry in a Standard Plenoptic Camera.	In this paper, we demonstrate light field triangulation to determine depth distances and baselines in a plenoptic camera. Advances in micro lenses and image sensors have enabled plenoptic cameras to capture a scene from different viewpoints with sufficient spatial resolution. While object distances can be inferred from disparities in a stereo viewpoint pair using triangulation, this concept remains ambiguous when applied in the case of plenoptic cameras. We present a geometrical light field model allowing the triangulation to be applied to a plenoptic camera in order to predict object distances or specify baselines as desired. It is shown that distance estimates from our novel method match those of real objects placed in front of the camera. Additional benchmark tests with an optical design software further validate the model's accuracy with deviations of less than ±0.33% for several main lens types and focus settings. A variety of applications in the automotive and robotics field can benefit from this estimation model.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1036-4	Christopher Hahne, Amar Aggoun, Vladan Velisavljevic, Susanne Fiebig, Matthias Pesch
Beyond Temporal Pooling: Recurrence and Temporal Convolutions for Gesture Recognition in Video.	Recent studies have demonstrated the power of recurrent neural networks for machine translation, image captioning and speech recognition. For the task of capturing temporal structure in video, however, there still remain numerous open research questions. Current research suggests using a simple temporal feature pooling strategy to take into account the temporal aspect of video. We demonstrate that this method is not sufficient for gesture recognition, where temporal information is more discriminative compared to general video classification tasks. We explore deep architectures for gesture recognition in video and propose a new end-to-end trainable neural network architecture incorporating temporal convolutions and bidirectional recurrence. Our main contributions are twofold; first, we show that recurrence is crucial for this task; second, we show that adding temporal convolutions leads to significant improvements. We evaluate the different approaches on the Montalbano gesture recognition dataset, where we achieve state-of-the-art results.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-016-0957-7	Lionel Pigou, Aäron van den Oord, Sander Dieleman, Mieke Van Herreweghe, Joni Dambre
Classification of Multi-class Daily Human Motion using Discriminative Body Parts and Sentence Descriptions.	In this paper, we propose a motion model that focuses on the discriminative parts of the human body related to target motions to classify human motions into specific categories, and apply this model to multi-class daily motion classifications. We extend this model to a motion recognition system which generates multiple sentences associated with human motions. The motion model is evaluated with the following four datasets acquired by a Kinect sensor or multiple infrared cameras in a motion capture studio: UCF-kinect; UT-kinect; HDM05-mocap; and YNL-mocap. We also evaluate the sentences generated from the dataset of motion and language pairs. The experimental results indicate that the motion model improves classification accuracy and our approach is better than other state-of-the-art methods for specific datasets, including human–object interactions with variations in the duration of motions, such as daily human motions. We achieve a classification rate of 81.1% for multi-class daily motion classifications in a non cross-subject setting. Additionally, the sentences generated by the motion recognition system are semantically and syntactically appropriate for the description of the target motion, which may lead to human–robot interaction using natural language.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1053-3	Yusuke Goutsu, Wataru Takano, Yoshihiko Nakamura
Cluster Sparsity Field: An Internal Hyperspectral Imagery Prior for Reconstruction.	Hyperspectral images (HSIs) have significant advantages over more traditional image types for a variety of computer vision applications dues to the extra information available. The practical reality of capturing and transmitting HSIs however, means that they often exhibit large amounts of noise, or are undersampled to reduce the data volume. Methods for combating such image corruption are thus critical to many HSIs applications. Here we devise a novel cluster sparsity field (CSF) based HSI reconstruction framework which explicitly models both the intrinsic correlation between measurements within the spectrum for a particular pixel, and the similarity between pixels due to the spatial structure of the HSI. These two priors have been shown to be effective previously, but have been always considered separately. By dividing pixels of the HSI into a group of spatial clusters on the basis of spectrum characteristics, we define CSF, a Markov random field based prior. In CSF, a structured sparsity potential models the correlation between measurements within each spectrum, and a graph structure potential models the similarity between pixels in each spatial cluster. Then, we integrate the CSF prior learning and image reconstruction into a unified variational framework for optimization, which makes the CSF prior image-specific, and robust to noise. It also results in more accurate image reconstruction compared with existing HSI reconstruction methods, thus combating the effects of noise corruption or undersampling. Extensive experiments on HSI denoising and HSI compressive sensing demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1080-8	Lei Zhang, Wei Wei, Yanning Zhang, Chunhua Shen, Anton van den Hengel, Qinfeng Shi
Combining Shape from Shading and Stereo: A Joint Variational Method for Estimating Depth, Illumination and Albedo.	"Shape from shading (SfS) and stereo are two fundamentally different strategies for image-based 3-D reconstruction. While approaches for SfS infer the depth solely from pixel intensities, methods for stereo are based on a matching process that establishes correspondences across images. This difference in approaching the reconstruction problem yields complementary advantages that are worthwhile being combined. So far, however, most ""joint"" approaches are based on an initial stereo mesh that is subsequently refined using shading information. In this paper we follow a completely different approach. We propose a joint variational method that combines both cues within a single minimisation framework. To this end, we fuse a Lambertian SfS approach with a robust stereo model and supplement the resulting energy functional with a detail-preserving anisotropic second-order smoothness term. Moreover, we extend the resulting model in such a way that it jointly estimates depth, albedo and illumination. This in turn makes the approach applicable to objects with non-uniform albedo as well as to scenes with unknown illumination. Experiments for synthetic and real-world images demonstrate the benefits of our combined approach: They not only show that our method is capable of generating very detailed reconstructions, but also that joint approaches are feasible in practice."	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1079-1	Daniel Maurer, Yong Chul Ju, Michael Breuß, Andrés Bruhn
Confidence-Weighted Local Expression Predictions for Occlusion Handling in Expression Recognition and Action Unit Detection.	Fully-automatic facial expression recognition (FER) is a key component of human behavior analysis. Performing FER from still images is a challenging task as it involves handling large interpersonal morphological differences, and as partial occlusions can occasionally happen. Furthermore, labelling expressions is a time-consuming process that is prone to subjectivity, thus the variability may not be fully covered by the training data. In this work, we propose to train random forests upon spatially-constrained random local subspaces of the face. The output local predictions form a categorical expression-driven high-level representation that we call local expression predictions (LEPs). LEPs can be combined to describe categorical facial expressions as well as action units (AUs). Furthermore, LEPs can be weighted by confidence scores provided by an autoencoder network. Such network is trained to locally capture the manifold of the non-occluded training data in a hierarchical way. Extensive experiments show that the proposed LEP representation yields high descriptive power for categorical expressions and AU occurrence prediction, and leads to interesting perspectives towards the design of occlusion-robust and confidence-aware FER systems.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1010-1	Arnaud Dapogny, Kevin Bailly, Séverine Dubuisson
Configurable 3D Scene Synthesis and 2D Image Rendering with Per-pixel Ground Truth Using Stochastic Grammars.	We propose a systematic learning-based approach to the generation of massive quantities of synthetic 3D scenes and arbitrary numbers of photorealistic 2D images thereof, with associated ground truth information, for the purposes of training, benchmarking, and diagnosing learning-based computer vision and robotics algorithms. In particular, we devise a learning-based pipeline of algorithms capable of automatically generating and rendering a potentially infinite variety of indoor scenes by using a stochastic grammar, represented as an attributed Spatial And-Or Graph, in conjunction with state-of-the-art physics-based rendering. Our pipeline is capable of synthesizing scene layouts with high diversity, and it is configurable inasmuch as it enables the precise customization and control of important attributes of the generated scenes. It renders photorealistic RGB images of the generated scenes while automatically synthesizing detailed, per-pixel ground truth data, including visible surface depth and normal, object identity, and material information (detailed to object parts), as well as environments (e.g., illuminations and camera viewpoints). We demonstrate the value of our synthesized dataset, by improving performance in certain machine-learning-based scene understanding tasks—depth and surface normal prediction, semantic segmentation, reconstruction, etc.—and by providing benchmarks for and diagnostics of trained models by modifying object attributes and scene properties in a controllable manner.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1103-5	Chenfanfu Jiang, Siyuan Qi, Yixin Zhu, Siyuan Huang, Jenny Lin, Lap-Fai Yu, Demetri Terzopoulos, Song-Chun Zhu
Deep Expectation of Real and Apparent Age from a Single Image Without Facial Landmarks.	In this paper we propose a deep learning solution to age estimation from a single face image without the use of facial landmarks and introduce the IMDB-WIKI dataset, the largest public dataset of face images with age and gender labels. If the real age estimation research spans over decades, the study of apparent age estimation or the age as perceived by other humans from a face image is a recent endeavor. We tackle both tasks with our convolutional neural networks (CNNs) of VGG-16 architecture which are pre-trained on ImageNet for image classification. We pose the age estimation problem as a deep classification problem followed by a softmax expected value refinement. The key factors of our solution are: deep learned models from large data, robust face alignment, and expected value formulation for age regression. We validate our methods on standard benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results for both real and apparent age estimation.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-016-0940-3	Rasmus Rothe, Radu Timofte, Luc Van Gool
Deep Multimodal Fusion: A Hybrid Approach.	We propose a novel hybrid model that exploits the strength of discriminative classifiers along with the representation power of generative models. Our focus is on detecting multimodal events in time varying sequences as well as generating missing data in any of the modalities. Discriminative classifiers have been shown to achieve higher performances than the corresponding generative likelihood-based classifiers. On the other hand, generative models learn a rich informative space which allows for data generation and joint feature representation that discriminative models lack. We propose a new model that jointly optimizes the representation space using a hybrid energy function. We employ a Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) based model to learn a shared representation across multiple modalities with time varying data. The Conditional RBMs (CRBMs) is an extension of the RBM model that takes into account short term temporal phenomena. The hybrid model involves augmenting CRBMs with a discriminative component for classification. For these purposes we propose a novel Multimodal Discriminative CRBMs (MMDCRBMs) model. First, we train the MMDCRBMs model using labeled data by training each modality, followed by training a fusion layer. Second, we exploit the generative capability of MMDCRBMs to activate the trained model so as to generate the lower-level data corresponding to the specific label that closely matches the actual input data. We evaluate our approach on ChaLearn dataset, audio-mocap, as well as the Tower Game dataset, mocap-mocap as well as three multimodal toy datasets. We report classification accuracy, generation accuracy, and localization accuracy and demonstrate its superiority compared to the state-of-the-art methods.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-0997-7	Mohamed R.

Deep Sign: Enabling Robust Statistical Continuous Sign Language Recognition via Hybrid CNN-HMMs.	This manuscript introduces the end-to-end embedding of a CNN into a HMM, while interpreting the outputs of the CNN in a Bayesian framework. The hybrid CNN-HMM combines the strong discriminative abilities of CNNs with the sequence modelling capabilities of HMMs. Most current approaches in the field of gesture and sign language recognition disregard the necessity of dealing with sequence data both for training and evaluation. With our presented end-to-end embedding we are able to improve over the state-of-the-art on three challenging benchmark continuous sign language recognition tasks by between 15 and 38% relative reduction in word error rate and up to 20% absolute. We analyse the effect of the CNN structure, network pretraining and number of hidden states. We compare the hybrid modelling to a tandem approach and evaluate the gain of model combination.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1121-3	Oscar Koller, Sepehr Zargaran, Hermann Ney, Richard Bowden
Defining the Pose of Any 3D Rigid Object and an Associated Distance.	The pose of a rigid object is usually regarded as a rigid transformation, described by a translation and a rotation. However, equating the pose space with the space of rigid transformations is in general abusive, as it does not account for objects with proper symmetries—which are common among man-made objects. In this article, we define pose as a distinguishable static state of an object, and equate a pose to a set of rigid transformations. Based solely on geometric considerations, we propose a frame-invariant metric on the space of possible poses, valid for any physical rigid object, and requiring no arbitrary tuning. This distance can be evaluated efficiently using a representation of poses within a Euclidean space of at most 12 dimensions depending on the object's symmetries. This makes it possible to efficiently perform neighborhood queries such as radius searches or k-nearest neighbor searches within a large set of poses using off-the-shelf methods. Pose averaging considering this metric can similarly be performed easily, using a projection function from the Euclidean space onto the pose space. The practical value of those theoretical developments is illustrated with an application of pose estimation of instances of a 3D rigid object given an input depth map, via a Mean Shift procedure.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1052-4	Romain Brégier, Frédéric Devernay, Laetitia Leyrit, James L.

Dense Reconstruction of Transparent Objects by Altering Incident Light Paths Through Refraction.	This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing the surface shape of transparent objects. The difficulty of this problem originates from the viewpoint dependent appearance of a transparent object, which quickly makes reconstruction methods tailored for diffuse surfaces fail disgracefully. In this paper, we introduce a fixed viewpoint approach to dense surface reconstruction of transparent objects based on refraction of light. We present a simple setup that allows us to alter the incident light paths before light rays enter the object by immersing the object partially in a liquid, and develop a method for recovering the object surface through reconstructing and triangulating such incident light paths. Our proposed approach does not need to model the complex interactions of light as it travels through the object, neither does it assume any parametric form for the object shape nor the exact number of refractions and reflections taken place along the light paths. It can therefore handle transparent objects with a relatively complex shape and structure, with unknown and inhomogeneous refractive index. We also show that for thin transparent objects, our proposed acquisition setup can be further simplified by adopting a single refraction approximation. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our proposed approach.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1045-3	Kai Han, Kwan-Yee K.

Depth-Based Hand Pose Estimation: Methods, Data, and Challenges.	Hand pose estimation has matured rapidly in recent years. The introduction of commodity depth sensors and a multitude of practical applications have spurred new advances. We provide an extensive analysis of the state-of-the-art, focusing on hand pose estimation from a single depth frame. To do so, we have implemented a considerable number of systems, and have released software and evaluation code. We summarize important conclusions here: (1) Coarse pose estimation appears viable for scenes with isolated hands. However, high precision pose estimation [required for immersive virtual reality and cluttered scenes (where hands may be interacting with nearby objects and surfaces) remain a challenge. To spur further progress we introduce a challenging new dataset with diverse, cluttered scenes. (2) Many methods evaluate themselves with disparate criteria, making comparisons difficult. We define a consistent evaluation criteria, rigorously motivated by human experiments. (3) We introduce a simple nearest-neighbor baseline that outperforms most existing systems. This implies that most systems do not generalize beyond their training sets. This also reinforces the under-appreciated point that training data is as important as the model itself. We conclude with directions for future progress.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1081-7	James Steven Supancic III, Grégory Rogez, Yi Yang, Jamie Shotton, Deva Ramanan
Describing Upper-Body Motions Based on Labanotation for Learning-from-Observation Robots.	We have been developing a paradigm that we call learning-from-observation for a robot to automatically acquire a robot program to conduct a series of operations, or for a robot to understand what to do, through observing humans performing the same operations. Since a simple mimicking method to repeat exact joint angles or exact end-effector trajectories does not work well because of the kinematic and dynamic differences between a human and a robot, the proposed method employs intermediate symbolic representations, tasks, for conceptually representing what-to-do through observation. These tasks are subsequently mapped to appropriate robot operations depending on the robot hardware. In the present work, task models for upper-body operations of humanoid robots are presented, which are designed on the basis of Labanotation. Given a series of human operations, we first analyze the upper-body motions and extract certain fixed poses from key frames. These key poses are translated into tasks represented by Labanotation symbols. Then, a robot performs the operations corresponding to those task models. Because tasks based on Labanotation are independent of robot hardware, different robots can share the same observation module, and only different task-mapping modules specific to robot hardware are required. The system was implemented and demonstrated that three different robots can automatically mimic human upper-body operations with a satisfactory level of resemblance.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1123-1	Katsushi Ikeuchi, Zhaoyuan Ma, Zengqiang Yan, Shunsuke Kudoh, Minako Nakamura
Discriminative Correlation Filter Tracker with Channel and Spatial Reliability.	Short-term tracking is an open and challenging problem for which discriminative correlation filters (DCF) have shown excellent performance. We introduce the channel and spatial reliability concepts to DCF tracking and provide a learning algorithm for its efficient and seamless integration in the filter update and the tracking process. The spatial reliability map adjusts the filter support to the part of the object suitable for tracking. This both allows to enlarge the search region and improves tracking of non-rectangular objects. Reliability scores reflect channel-wise quality of the learned filters and are used as feature weighting coefficients in localization. Experimentally, with only two simple standard feature sets, HoGs and colornames, the novel CSR-DCF method—DCF with channel and spatial reliability—achieves state-of-the-art results on VOT 2016, VOT 2015 and OTB100. The CSR-DCF runs close to real-time on a CPU.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1061-3	Alan Lukezic, Tomás Vojír, Luka Cehovin Zajc, Jiri Matas, Matej Kristan
Do Semantic Parts Emerge in Convolutional Neural Networks?	Semantic object parts can be useful for several visual recognition tasks. Lately, these tasks have been addressed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), achieving outstanding results. In this work we study whether CNNs learn semantic parts in their internal representation. We investigate the responses of convolutional filters and try to associate their stimuli with semantic parts. We perform two extensive quantitative analyses. First, we use ground-truth part bounding-boxes from the PASCAL-Part dataset to determine how many of those semantic parts emerge in the CNN. We explore this emergence for different layers, network depths, and supervision levels. Second, we collect human judgements in order to study what fraction of all filters systematically fire on any semantic part, even if not annotated in PASCAL-Part. Moreover, we explore several connections between discriminative power and semantics. We find out which are the most discriminative filters for object recognition, and analyze whether they respond to semantic parts or to other image patches. We also investigate the other direction: we determine which semantic parts are the most discriminative and whether they correspond to those parts emerging in the network. This enables to gain an even deeper understanding of the role of semantic parts in the network.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1048-0	Abel Gonzalez-Garcia, Davide Modolo, Vittorio Ferrari
Dynamic Behavior Analysis via Structured Rank Minimization.	Human behavior and affect is inherently a dynamic phenomenon involving temporal evolution of patterns manifested through a multiplicity of non-verbal behavioral cues including facial expressions, body postures and gestures, and vocal outbursts. A natural assumption for human behavior modeling is that a continuous-time characterization of behavior is the output of a linear time-invariant system when behavioral cues act as the input (e.g., continuous rather than discrete annotations of dimensional affect). Here we study the learning of such dynamical system under real-world conditions, namely in the presence of noisy behavioral cues descriptors and possibly unreliable annotations by employing structured rank minimization. To this end, a novel structured rank minimization method and its scalable variant are proposed. The generalizability of the proposed framework is demonstrated by conducting experiments on 3 distinct dynamic behavior analysis tasks, namely (i) conflict intensity prediction, (ii) prediction of valence and arousal, and (iii) tracklet matching. The attained results outperform those achieved by other state-of-the-art methods for these tasks and, hence, evidence the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-016-0985-3	Christos Georgakis, Yannis Panagakis, Maja Pantic
EMVS: Event-Based Multi-View Stereo - 3D Reconstruction with an Event Camera in Real-Time.	Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that output pixel-level brightness changes instead of standard intensity frames. They offer significant advantages over standard cameras, namely a very high dynamic range, no motion blur, and a latency in the order of microseconds. However, because the output is composed of a sequence of asynchronous events rather than actual intensity images, traditional vision algorithms cannot be applied, so that a paradigm shift is needed. We introduce the problem of event-based multi-view stereo (EMVS) for event cameras and propose a solution to it. Unlike traditional MVS methods, which address the problem of estimating dense 3D structure from a set of known viewpoints, EMVS estimates semi-dense 3D structure from an event camera with known trajectory. Our EMVS solution elegantly exploits two inherent properties of an event camera: (1) its ability to respond to scene edges—which naturally provide semi-dense geometric information without any pre-processing operation—and (2) the fact that it provides continuous measurements as the sensor moves. Despite its simplicity (it can be implemented in a few lines of code), our algorithm is able to produce accurate, semi-dense depth maps, without requiring any explicit data association or intensity estimation. We successfully validate our method on both synthetic and real data. Our method is computationally very efficient and runs in real-time on a CPU.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1050-6	Henri Rebecq, Guillermo Gallego, Elias Mueggler, Davide Scaramuzza
Efficient Label Collection for Image Datasets via Hierarchical Clustering.	Raw visual data used to train classifiers is abundant and easy to gather, but lacks semantic labels that describe visual concepts of interest. These labels are necessary for supervised learning and can require significant human effort to collect. We discuss four labeling objectives that play an important role in the design of frameworks aimed at collecting label information for large training sets while maintaining low human effort: discovery, efficiency, exploitation and accuracy. We introduce a framework that explicitly models and balances these four labeling objectives with the use of (1) hierarchical clustering, (2) a novel interestingness measure that defines structural change within the hierarchy, and (3) an iterative group-based labeling process that exploits relationships between labeled and unlabeled data. Results on benchmark data show that our framework collects labeled training data more efficiently than existing labeling techniques and trains higher performing visual classifiers. Further, we show that our resulting framework is fast and significantly reduces human interaction time when labeling real-world multi-concept imagery depicting outdoor environments.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1039-1	Maggie B.

Elastic Alignment of Triangular Surface Meshes.	A novel region-based approach is proposed to find a thin plate spline map between a pair of deformable 3D objects represented by triangular surface meshes. The proposed method works without landmark extraction and feature correspondences. The aligning transformation is simply found by solving a system of integral equations. Each equation is generated by integrating a non-linear function over the object domains. We derive recursive formulas for the efficient computation of these integrals for open and closed surface meshes. Based on a series of comparative tests on a large synthetic dataset, our triangular mesh-based algorithm outperforms state of the art methods both in terms of computing time and accuracy. The applicability of the proposed approach has been demonstrated on the registration of 3D lung CT volumes, brain surfaces and 3D human faces.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1084-4	Zsolt Sánta, Zoltan Kato
Every Moment Counts: Dense Detailed Labeling of Actions in Complex Videos.	Every moment counts in action recognition. A comprehensive understanding of human activity in video requires labeling every frame according to the actions occurring, placing multiple labels densely over a video sequence. To study this problem we extend the existing THUMOS dataset and introduce MultiTHUMOS, a new dataset of dense labels over unconstrained internet videos. Modeling multiple, dense labels benefits from temporal relations within and across classes. We define a novel variant of long short-term memory deep networks for modeling these temporal relations via multiple input and output connections. We show that this model improves action labeling accuracy and further enables deeper understanding tasks ranging from structured retrieval to action prediction.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1013-y	Serena Yeung, Olga Russakovsky, Ning Jin, Mykhaylo Andriluka, Greg Mori, Li Fei-Fei
Feedback and Surround Modulated Boundary Detection.	"Edges are key components of any visual scene to the extent that we can recognise objects merely by their silhouettes. The human visual system captures edge information through neurons in the visual cortex that are sensitive to both intensity discontinuities and particular orientations. The ""classical approach"" assumes that these cells are only responsive to the stimulus present within their receptive fields, however, recent studies demonstrate that surrounding regions and inter-areal feedback connections influence their responses significantly. In this work we propose a biologically-inspired edge detection model in which orientation selective neurons are represented through the first derivative of a Gaussian function resembling double-opponent cells in the primary visual cortex (V1). In our model we account for four kinds of receptive field surround, i.e. full, far, iso- and orthogonal-orientation, whose contributions are contrast-dependant. The output signal from V1 is pooled in its perpendicular direction by larger V2 neurons employing a contrast-variant centre-surround kernel. We further introduce a feedback connection from higher-level visual areas to the lower ones. The results of our model on three benchmark datasets show a big improvement compared to the current non-learning and biologically-inspired state-of-the-art algorithms while being competitive to the learning-based methods."	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1035-5	Arash Akbarinia, C.

Focal Flow: Velocity and Depth from Differential Defocus Through Motion.	We present the focal flow sensor. It is an unactuated, monocular camera that simultaneously exploits defocus and differential motion to measure a depth map and a 3D scene velocity field. It does this using an optical-flow-like, per-pixel linear constraint that relates image derivatives to depth and velocity. We derive this constraint, prove its invariance to scene texture, and prove that it is exactly satisfied only when the sensor's blur kernels are Gaussian. We analyze the inherent sensitivity of the focal flow cue, and we build and test a prototype. Experiments produce useful depth and velocity information for a broader set of aperture configurations, including a simple lens with a pillbox aperture.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1051-5	Emma Alexander, Qi Guo, Sanjeev J.

From Facial Expression Recognition to Interpersonal Relation Prediction.	Interpersonal relation defines the association, e.g., warm, friendliness, and dominance, between two or more people. We investigate if such fine-grained and high-level relation traits can be characterized and quantified from face images in the wild. We address this challenging problem by first studying a deep network architecture for robust recognition of facial expressions. Unlike existing models that typically learn from facial expression labels alone, we devise an effective multitask network that is capable of learning from rich auxiliary attributes such as gender, age, and head pose, beyond just facial expression data. While conventional supervised training requires datasets with complete labels (e.g., all samples must be labeled with gender, age, and expression), we show that this requirement can be relaxed via a novel attribute propagation method. The approach further allows us to leverage the inherent correspondences between heterogeneous attribute sources despite the disparate distributions of different datasets. With the network we demonstrate state-of-the-art results on existing facial expression recognition benchmarks. To predict inter-personal relation, we use the expression recognition network as branches for a Siamese model. Extensive experiments show that our model is capable of mining mutual context of faces for accurate fine-grained interpersonal prediction.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1055-1	Zhanpeng Zhang, Ping Luo, Chen Change Loy, Xiaoou Tang
Graph-Based Slice-to-Volume Deformable Registration.	Deformable image registration is a fundamental problem in computer vision and medical image computing. In this paper we investigate the use of graphical models in the context of a particular type of image registration problem, known as slice-to-volume registration. We introduce a scalable, modular and flexible formulation that can accommodate low-rank and high order terms, that simultaneously selects the plane and estimates the in-plane deformation through a single shot optimization approach. The proposed framework is instantiated into different variants seeking either a compromise between computational efficiency (soft plane selection constraints and approximate definition of the data similarity terms through pair-wise components) or exact definition of the data terms and the constraints on the plane selection. Simulated and real-data in the context of ultrasound and magnetic resonance registration (where both framework instantiations as well as different optimization strategies are considered) demonstrate the potentials of our method.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1040-8	Enzo Ferrante, Nikos Paragios
Hallucinating Compressed Face Images.	A face hallucination algorithm is proposed to generate high-resolution images from JPEG compressed low-resolution inputs by decomposing a deblocked face image into structural regions such as facial components and non-structural regions like the background. For structural regions, landmarks are used to retrieve adequate high-resolution component exemplars in a large dataset based on the estimated head pose and illumination condition. For non-structural regions, an efficient generic super resolution algorithm is applied to generate high-resolution counterparts. Two sets of gradient maps extracted from these two regions are combined to guide an optimization process of generating the hallucination image. Numerous experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art hallucination methods on JPEG compressed face images with different poses, expressions, and illumination conditions.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1044-4	Chih-Yuan Yang, Sifei Liu, Ming-Hsuan Yang
Hierarchical Cellular Automata for Visual Saliency.	Saliency detection, finding the most important parts of an image, has become increasingly popular in computer vision. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical Cellular Automata (HCA)—a temporally evolving model to intelligently detect salient objects. HCA consists of two main components: Single-layer Cellular Automata (SCA) and Cuboid Cellular Automata (CCA). As an unsupervised propagation mechanism, Single-layer Cellular Automata can exploit the intrinsic relevance of similar regions through interactions with neighbors. Low-level image features as well as high-level semantic information extracted from deep neural networks are incorporated into the SCA to measure the correlation between different image patches. With these hierarchical deep features, an impact factor matrix and a coherence matrix are constructed to balance the influences on each cell's next state. The saliency values of all cells are iteratively updated according to a well-defined update rule. Furthermore, we propose CCA to integrate multiple saliency maps generated by SCA at different scales in a Bayesian framework. Therefore, single-layer propagation and multi-scale integration are jointly modeled in our unified HCA. Surprisingly, we find that the SCA can improve all existing methods that we applied it to, resulting in a similar precision level regardless of the original results. The CCA can act as an efficient pixel-wise aggregation algorithm that can integrate state-of-the-art methods, resulting in even better results. Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art conventional methods and is competitive with deep learning based approaches.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1062-2	Yao Qin, Mengyang Feng, Huchuan Lu, Garrison W.

Image-Based Synthesis for Deep 3D Human Pose Estimation.	This paper addresses the problem of 3D human pose estimation in the wild. A significant challenge is the lack of training data, i.e., 2D images of humans annotated with 3D poses. Such data is necessary to train state-of-the-art CNN architectures. Here, we propose a solution to generate a large set of photorealistic synthetic images of humans with 3D pose annotations. We introduce an image-based synthesis engine that artificially augments a dataset of real images with 2D human pose annotations using 3D motion capture data. Given a candidate 3D pose, our algorithm selects for each joint an image whose 2D pose locally matches the projected 3D pose. The selected images are then combined to generate a new synthetic image by stitching local image patches in a kinematically constrained manner. The resulting images are used to train an end-to-end CNN for full-body 3D pose estimation. We cluster the training data into a large number of pose classes and tackle pose estimation as a K-way classification problem. Such an approach is viable only with large training sets such as ours. Our method outperforms most of the published works in terms of 3D pose estimation in controlled environments (Human3.6M) and shows promising results for real-world images (LSP). This demonstrates that CNNs trained on artificial images generalize well to real images. Compared to data generated from more classical rendering engines, our synthetic images do not require any domain adaptation or fine-tuning stage.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1071-9	Grégory Rogez, Cordelia Schmid
Joint Contour Filtering.	Edge/structure-preserving operations for images aim to smooth images without blurring the edges/structures. Many exemplary edge-preserving filtering methods have recently been proposed to reduce the computational complexity and/or separate structures of different scales. They normally adopt a user-selected scale measurement to control the detail smoothing. However, natural photos contain objects of different sizes, which cannot be described by a single scale measurement. On the other hand, contour analysis is closely related to edge-preserving filtering, and significant progress has recently been achieved. Nevertheless, the majority of state-of-the-art filtering techniques have ignored the successes in this area. Inspired by the fact that learning-based edge detectors significantly outperform traditional manually-designed detectors, this paper proposes a learning-based edge-preserving filtering technique. It synergistically combines the differential operations in edge-preserving filters with the effectiveness of the recent edge detectors for scale-aware filtering. Unlike previous filtering methods, the proposed filters can efficiently extract subjectively meaningful structures from natural scenes containing multiple-scale objects.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1091-5	Xing Wei, Qingxiong Yang, Yihong Gong
Joint Estimation of Human Pose and Conversational Groups from Social Scenes.	Despite many attempts in the last few years, automatic analysis of social scenes captured by wide-angle camera networks remains a very challenging task due to the low resolution of targets, background clutter and frequent and persistent occlusions. In this paper, we present a novel framework for jointly estimating (i) head, body orientations of targets and (ii) conversational groups called F-formations from social scenes. In contrast to prior works that have (a) exploited the limited range of head and body orientations to jointly learn both, or (b) employed the mutual head (but not body) pose of interactors for deducing F-formations, we propose a weakly-supervised learning algorithm for joint inference. Our algorithm employs body pose as the primary cue for F-formation estimation, and an alternating optimization strategy is proposed to iteratively refine F-formation and pose estimates. We demonstrate the increased efficacy of joint inference over the state-of-the-art via extensive experiments on three social datasets.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1026-6	Jagannadan Varadarajan, Ramanathan Subramanian, Samuel Rota Bulò, Narendra Ahuja, Oswald Lanz, Elisa Ricci
Label Propagation with Ensemble of Pairwise Geometric Relations: Towards Robust Large-Scale Retrieval of Object Instances.	Spatial verification methods permit geometrically stable image matching, but still involve a difficult trade-off between robustness as regards incorrect rejection of true correspondences and discriminative power in terms of mismatches. To address this issue, we ask whether an ensemble of weak geometric constraints that correlates with visual similarity only slightly better than a bag-of-visual-words model performs better than a single strong constraint. We consider a family of spatial verification methods and decompose them into fundamental constraints imposed on pairs of feature correspondences. Encompassing such constraints leads us to propose a new method, which takes the best of existing techniques and functions as a unified Ensemble of pAirwise GEometric Relations (EAGER), in terms of both spatial contexts and between-image transformations. We also introduce a novel and robust reranking method, in which the object instances localized by EAGER in high-ranked database images are reissued as new queries. EAGER is extended to develop a smoothness constraint where the similarity between the optimized ranking scores of two instances should be maximally consistent with their geometrically constrained similarity. Reranking is newly formulated as two label propagation problems: one is to assess the confidence of new queries and the other to aggregate new independently executed retrievals. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets show that EAGER and our reranking method outperform most of their state-of-the-art counterparts, especially when large-scale visual vocabularies are used.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1063-9	Xiaomeng Wu, Kaoru Hiramatsu, Kunio Kashino
Large Scale 3D Morphable Models.	We present large scale facial model (LSFM)—a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) automatically constructed from 9663 distinct facial identities. To the best of our knowledge LSFM is the largest-scale Morphable Model ever constructed, containing statistical information from a huge variety of the human population. To build such a large model we introduce a novel fully automated and robust Morphable Model construction pipeline, informed by an evaluation of state-of-the-art dense correspondence techniques. The dataset that LSFM is trained on includes rich demographic information about each subject, allowing for the construction of not only a global 3DMM model but also models tailored for specific age, gender or ethnicity groups. We utilize the proposed model to perform age classification from 3D shape alone and to reconstruct noisy out-of-sample data in the low-dimensional model space. Furthermore, we perform a systematic analysis of the constructed 3DMM models that showcases their quality and descriptive power. The presented extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveal that the proposed 3DMM achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing models by a large margin. Finally, for the benefit of the research community, we make publicly available the source code of the proposed automatic 3DMM construction pipeline, as well as the constructed global 3DMM and a variety of bespoke models tailored by age, gender and ethnicity.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1009-7	James Booth, Anastasios Roussos, Allan Ponniah, David J.

Learning Latent Representations of 3D Human Pose with Deep Neural Networks.	Most recent approaches to monocular 3D pose estimation rely on Deep Learning. They either train a Convolutional Neural Network to directly regress from an image to a 3D pose, which ignores the dependencies between human joints, or model these dependencies via a max-margin structured learning framework, which involves a high computational cost at inference time. In this paper, we introduce a Deep Learning regression architecture for structured prediction of 3D human pose from monocular images or 2D joint location heatmaps that relies on an overcomplete autoencoder to learn a high-dimensional latent pose representation and accounts for joint dependencies. We further propose an efficient Long Short-Term Memory network to enforce temporal consistency on 3D pose predictions. We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance both in terms of structure preservation and prediction accuracy on standard 3D human pose estimation benchmarks.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1066-6	Isinsu Katircioglu, Bugra Tekin, Mathieu Salzmann, Vincent Lepetit, Pascal Fua
Learning Sight from Sound: Ambient Sound Provides Supervision for Visual Learning.	The sound of crashing waves, the roar of fast-moving cars—sound conveys important information about the objects in our surroundings. In this work, we show that ambient sounds can be used as a supervisory signal for learning visual models. To demonstrate this, we train a convolutional neural network to predict a statistical summary of the sound associated with a video frame. We show that, through this process, the network learns a representation that conveys information about objects and scenes. We evaluate this representation on several recognition tasks, finding that its performance is comparable to that of other state-of-the-art unsupervised learning methods. Finally, we show through visualizations that the network learns units that are selective to objects that are often associated with characteristic sounds. This paper extends an earlier conference paper, Owens et al. (in: European conference on computer vision, 2016b), with additional experiments and discussion.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1083-5	Andrew Owens, Jiajun Wu, Josh H. McDermott, William T.

Learning to Detect Good 3D Keypoints.	The established approach to 3D keypoint detection consists in defining effective handcrafted saliency functions based on geometric cues with the aim of maximizing keypoint repeatability. Differently, the idea behind our work is to learn a descriptor-specific keypoint detector so as to optimize the end-to-end performance of the feature matching pipeline. Accordingly, we cast 3D keypoint detection as a classification problem between surface patches that can or cannot be matched correctly by a given 3D descriptor, i.e. those either good or not in respect to that descriptor. We propose a machine learning framework that allows for defining examples of good surface patches from the training data and leverages Random Forest classifiers to realize both fixed-scale and adaptive-scale 3D keypoint detectors. Through extensive experiments on standard datasets, we show how feature matching performance improves significantly by deploying 3D descriptors together with companion detectors learned by our methodology with respect to the adoption of established state-of-the-art 3D detectors based on hand-crafted saliency functions.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1037-3	Alessio Tonioni, Samuele Salti, Federico Tombari, Riccardo Spezialetti, Luigi Di Stefano
Multi-label Learning with Missing Labels Using Mixed Dependency Graphs.	This work focuses on the problem of multi-label learning with missing labels (MLML), which aims to label each test instance with multiple class labels given training instances that have an incomplete/partial set of these labels (i.e., some of their labels are missing). The key point to handle missing labels is propagating the label information from the provided labels to missing labels, through a dependency graph that each label of each instance is treated as a node. We build this graph by utilizing different types of label dependencies. Specifically, the instance-level similarity is served as undirected edges to connect the label nodes across different instances and the semantic label hierarchy is used as directed edges to connect different classes. This base graph is referred to as the mixed dependency graph, as it includes both undirected and directed edges. Furthermore, we present another two types of label dependencies to connect the label nodes across different classes. One is the class co-occurrence, which is also encoded as undirected edges. Combining with the above base graph, we obtain a new mixed graph, called mixed graph with co-occurrence (MG-CO). The other is the sparse and low rank decomposition of the whole label matrix, to embed high-order dependencies over all labels. Combining with the base graph, the new mixed graph is called as MG-SL (mixed graph with sparse and low rank decomposition). Based on MG-CO and MG-SL, we further propose two convex transductive formulations of the MLML problem, denoted as MLMG-CO and MLMG-SL respectively. In both formulations, the instance-level similarity is embedded through a quadratic smoothness term, while the semantic label hierarchy is used as a linear constraint. In MLMG-CO, the class co-occurrence is also formulated as a quadratic smoothness term, while the sparse and low rank decomposition is incorporated into MLMG-SL, through two additional matrices (one is assumed as sparse, and the other is assumed as low rank) and an equivalence constraint between the summation of this two matrices and the original label matrix. Interestingly, two important applications, including image annotation and tag based image retrieval, can be jointly handled using our proposed methods. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our methods lead to significant improvements in performance and robustness to missing labels over the state-of-the-art methods.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1085-3	Baoyuan Wu, Fan Jia, Wei Liu, Bernard Ghanem, Siwei Lyu
No-Reference Image Quality Assessment for Image Auto-Denoising.	This paper proposes two new non-reference image quality metrics that can be adopted by the state-of-the-art image/video denoising algorithms for auto-denoising. The first metric is proposed based on the assumption that the noise should be independent of the original image. A direct measurement of this dependence is, however, impractical due to the relatively low accuracy of existing denoising method. The proposed metric thus tackles the homogeneous regions and highly-structured regions separately. Nevertheless, this metric is only stable when the noise level is relatively low. Most denoising algorithms reduce noise by (weighted) averaging repeated noisy measurements. As a result, another metric is proposed for high-level noise based on the fact that more noisy measurements will be required when the noise level increases. The number of measurements before converging is thus related to the quality of noisy images. Our patch-matching based metric proposes to iteratively find and add noisy image measurements for averaging until there is no visible difference between two successively averaged images. Both metrics are evaluated on LIVE2 (Sheikh et al. in LIVE image quality assessment database release 2: 2013) and TID2013 (Ponomarenko et al. in Color image database tid2013: Peculiarities and preliminary results: 2005) data sets using standard Spearman and Kendall rank-order correlation coefficients (ROCC), showing that they subjectively outperforms current state-of-the-art no-reference metrics. Quantitative evaluation w.r.t. different level of synthetic noisy images also demonstrates consistently higher performance over state-of-the-art non-reference metrics when used for image denoising.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1054-2	Xiangfei Kong, Qingxiong Yang
Occlusion-Aware 3D Morphable Models and an Illumination Prior for Face Image Analysis.	Faces in natural images are often occluded by a variety of objects. We propose a fully automated, probabilistic and occlusion-aware 3D morphable face model adaptation framework following an analysis-by-synthesis setup. The key idea is to segment the image into regions explained by separate models. Our framework includes a 3D morphable face model, a prototype-based beard model and a simple model for occlusions and background regions. The segmentation and all the model parameters have to be inferred from the single target image. Face model adaptation and segmentation are solved jointly using an expectation–maximization-like procedure. During the E-step, we update the segmentation and in the M-step the face model parameters are updated. For face model adaptation we apply a stochastic sampling strategy based on the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. For segmentation, we apply loopy belief propagation for inference in a Markov random field. Illumination estimation is critical for occlusion handling. Our combined segmentation and model adaptation needs a proper initialization of the illumination parameters. We propose a RANSAC-based robust illumination estimation technique. By applying this method to a large face image database we obtain a first empirical distribution of real-world illumination conditions. The obtained empirical distribution is made publicly available and can be used as prior in probabilistic frameworks, for regularization or to synthesize data for deep learning methods.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1064-8	Bernhard Egger, Sandro Schönborn, Andreas Schneider, Adam Kortylewski, Andreas Morel-Forster, Clemens Blumer, Thomas Vetter
On Unifying Multi-view Self-Representations for Clustering by Tensor Multi-rank Minimization.	In this paper, we address the multi-view subspace clustering problem. Our method utilizes the circulant algebra for tensor, which is constructed by stacking the subspace representation matrices of different views and then rotating, to capture the low rank tensor subspace so that the refinement of the view-specific subspaces can be achieved, as well as the high order correlations underlying multi-view data can be explored. By introducing a recently proposed tensor factorization, namely tensor-Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD) (Kilmer et al. in SIAM J Matrix Anal Appl 34(1):148–172, 2013), we can impose a new type of low-rank tensor constraint on the rotated tensor to ensure the consensus among multiple views. Different from traditional unfolding based tensor norm, this low-rank tensor constraint has optimality properties similar to that of matrix rank derived from SVD, so the complementary information can be explored and propagated among all the views more thoroughly and effectively. The established model, called t-SVD based Multi-view Subspace Clustering (t-SVD-MSC), falls into the applicable scope of augmented Lagrangian method, and its minimization problem can be efficiently solved with theoretical convergence guarantee and relatively low computational complexity. Extensive experimental testing on eight challenging image datasets shows that the proposed method has achieved highly competent objective performance compared to several state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1086-2	Yuan Xie, Dacheng Tao, Wensheng Zhang, Yan Liu, Lei Zhang, Yanyun Qu
On the Beneficial Effect of Noise in Vertex Localization.	A theoretical and experimental analysis related to the effect of noise in the task of vertex identification in unknown shapes is presented. Shapes are seen as real functions of their closed boundary. An alternative global perspective of curvature is examined providing insight into the process of noise-enabled vertex localization. The analysis reveals that noise facilitates in the localization of certain vertices. The concept of noising is thus considered and a relevant global method for localizing Global Vertices is investigated in relation to local methods under the presence of increasing noise. Theoretical analysis reveals that induced noise can indeed help localizing certain vertices if combined with global descriptors. Experiments with noise and a comparison to localized methods validate the theoretical results.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1034-6	Konstantinos Raftopoulos, Stefanos D. Kollias, Dionysios D.

Person Re-identification in Identity Regression Space.	Most existing person re-identification (re-id) methods are unsuitable for real-world deployment due to two reasons: Unscalability to large population size, and Inadaptability over time. In this work, we present a unified solution to address both problems. Specifically, we propose to construct an identity regression space (IRS) based on embedding different training person identities (classes) and formulate re-id as a regression problem solved by identity regression in the IRS. The IRS approach is characterised by a closed-form solution with high learning efficiency and an inherent incremental learning capability with human-in-the-loop. Extensive experiments on four benchmarking datasets (VIPeR, CUHK01, CUHK03 and Market-1501) show that the IRS model not only outperforms state-of-the-art re-id methods, but also is more scalable to large re-id population size by rapidly updating model and actively selecting informative samples with reduced human labelling effort.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1105-3	Hanxiao Wang, Xiatian Zhu, Shaogang Gong, Tao Xiang
Predicting Foreground Object Ambiguity and Efficiently Crowdsourcing the Segmentation(s).	"We propose the ambiguity problem for the foreground object segmentation task and motivate the importance of estimating and accounting for this ambiguity when designing vision systems. Specifically, we distinguish between images which lead multiple annotators to segment different foreground objects (ambiguous) versus minor inter-annotator differences of the same object. Taking images from eight widely used datasets, we crowdsource labeling the images as ""ambiguous"" or ""not ambiguous"" to segment in order to construct a new dataset we call STATIC. Using STATIC, we develop a system that automatically predicts which images are ambiguous. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of our prediction system over existing saliency-based methods on images from vision benchmarks and images taken by blind people who are trying to recognize objects in their environment. Finally, we introduce a crowdsourcing system to achieve cost savings for collecting the diversity of all valid ""ground truth"" foreground object segmentations by collecting extra segmentations only when ambiguity is expected. Experiments show our system eliminates up to 47% of human effort compared to existing crowdsourcing methods with no loss in capturing the diversity of ground truths."	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1065-7	Danna Gurari, Kun He, Bo Xiong, Jianming Zhang, Mehrnoosh Sameki, Suyog Dutt Jain, Stan Sclaroff, Margrit Betke, Kristen Grauman
Prediction of Manipulation Actions.	"By looking at a person's hands, one can often tell what the person is going to do next, how his/her hands are moving and where they will be, because an actor's intentions shape his/her movement kinematics during action execution. Similarly, active systems with real-time constraints must not simply rely on passive video-segment classification, but they have to continuously update their estimates and predict future actions. In this paper, we study the prediction of dexterous actions. We recorded videos of subjects performing different manipulation actions on the same object, such as ""squeezing"", ""flipping"", ""washing"", ""wiping"" and ""scratching"" with a sponge. In psychophysical experiments, we evaluated human observers' skills in predicting actions from video sequences of different length, depicting the hand movement in the preparation and execution of actions before and after contact with the object. We then developed a recurrent neural network based method for action prediction using as input image patches around the hand. We also used the same formalism to predict the forces on the finger tips using for training synchronized video and force data streams. Evaluations on two new datasets show that our system closely matches human performance in the recognition task, and demonstrate the ability of our algorithms to predict in real time what and how a dexterous action is performed."	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-0992-z	Cornelia Fermüller, Fang Wang, Yezhou Yang, Konstantinos Zampogiannis, Yi Zhang, Francisco Barranco, Michael Pfeiffer
RAW Image Reconstruction Using a Self-contained sRGB-JPEG Image with Small Memory Overhead.	Most camera images are saved as 8-bit standard RGB (sRGB) compressed JPEGs. Even when JPEG compression is set to its highest quality, the encoded sRGB image has been significantly processed in terms of color and tone manipulation. This makes sRGB–JPEG images undesirable for many computer vision tasks that assume a direct relationship between pixel values and incoming light. For such applications, the RAW image format is preferred, as RAW represents a minimally processed, sensor-specific RGB image that is linear with respect to scene radiance. The drawback with RAW images, however, is that they require large amounts of storage and are not well-supported by many imaging applications. To address this issue, we present a method to encode the necessary data within an sRGB–JPEG image to reconstruct a high-quality RAW image. Our approach requires no calibration of the camera's colorimetric properties and can reconstruct the original RAW to within 0.5% error with a small memory overhead for the additional data (e.g., 128 KB). More importantly, our output is a fully self-contained 100% compliant sRGB–JPEG file that can be used as-is, not affecting any existing image workflow—the RAW image data can be extracted when needed, or ignored otherwise. We detail our approach and show its effectiveness against competing strategies.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1056-0	Rang Ho Man Nguyen, Michael S. Brown
RED-Net: A Recurrent Encoder-Decoder Network for Video-Based Face Alignment.	We propose a novel method for real-time face alignment in videos based on a recurrent encoder–decoder network model. Our proposed model predicts 2D facial point heat maps regularized by both detection and regression loss, while uniquely exploiting recurrent learning at both spatial and temporal dimensions. At the spatial level, we add a feedback loop connection between the combined output response map and the input, in order to enable iterative coarse-to-fine face alignment using a single network model, instead of relying on traditional cascaded model ensembles. At the temporal level, we first decouple the features in the bottleneck of the network into temporal-variant factors, such as pose and expression, and temporal-invariant factors, such as identity information. Temporal recurrent learning is then applied to the decoupled temporal-variant features. We show that such feature disentangling yields better generalization and significantly more accurate results at test time. We perform a comprehensive experimental analysis, showing the importance of each component of our proposed model, as well as superior results over the state of the art and several variations of our method in standard datasets.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1095-1	Xi Peng, Rogério Schmidt Feris, Xiaoyu Wang, Dimitris N.

Real-Time Accurate 3D Head Tracking and Pose Estimation with Consumer RGB-D Cameras.	We demonstrate how 3D head tracking and pose estimation can be effectively and efficiently achieved from noisy RGB-D sequences. Our proposal leverages on a random forest framework, designed to regress the 3D head pose at every frame in a temporal tracking manner. One peculiarity of the algorithm is that it exploits together (1) a generic training dataset of 3D head models, which is learned once offline; and, (2) an online refinement with subject-specific 3D data, which aims for the tracker to withstand slight facial deformations and to adapt its forest to the specific characteristics of an individual subject. The combination of these works allows our algorithm to be robust even under extreme poses, where the user's face is no longer visible on the image. Finally, we also propose another solution that utilizes a multi-camera system such that the data simultaneously acquired from multiple RGB-D sensors helps the tracker to handle challenging conditions that affect a subset of the cameras. Notably, the proposed multi-camera frameworks yields a real-time performance of approximately 8 ms per frame given six cameras and one CPU core, and scales up linearly to 30 fps with 25 cameras.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-0988-8	David Joseph Tan, Federico Tombari, Nassir Navab
Real-Time Intensity-Image Reconstruction for Event Cameras Using Manifold Regularisation.	Event cameras or neuromorphic cameras mimic the human perception system as they measure the per-pixel intensity change rather than the actual intensity level. In contrast to traditional cameras, such cameras capture new information about the scene at MHz frequency in the form of sparse events. The high temporal resolution comes at the cost of losing the familiar per-pixel intensity information. In this work we propose a variational model that accurately models the behaviour of event cameras, enabling reconstruction of intensity images with arbitrary frame rate in real-time. Our method is formulated on a per-event-basis, where we explicitly incorporate information about the asynchronous nature of events via an event manifold induced by the relative timestamps of events. In our experiments we verify that solving the variational model on the manifold produces high-quality images without explicitly estimating optical flow. This paper is an extended version of our previous work (Reinbacher et al. in British machine vision conference (BMVC), 2016) and contains additional details of the variational model, an investigation of different data terms and a quantitative evaluation of our method against competing methods as well as synthetic ground-truth data.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1106-2	Gottfried Munda, Christian Reinbacher, Thomas Pock
Robust Detection and Affine Rectification of Planar Homogeneous Texture for Scene Understanding.	Man-made environments tend to be abundant with planar homogeneous texture, which manifests as regularly repeating scene elements along a plane. In this work, we propose to exploit such structure to facilitate high-level scene understanding. By robustly fitting a texture projection model to optimal dominant frequency estimates in image patches, we arrive at a projective-invariant method to localize such generic, semantically meaningful regions in multi-planar scenes. The recovered projective parameters also allow an affine-ambiguous rectification in real-world images marred with outliers, room clutter, and photometric severities. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations are performed that show our method outperforms existing representative work for both rectification and detection. The potential of homogeneous texture for two scene understanding tasks is then explored. Firstly, in environments where vanishing points cannot be reliably detected, or the Manhattan assumption is not satisfied, homogeneous texture detected by the proposed approach is shown to provide alternative cues to obtain a scene geometric layout. Second, low-level feature descriptors extracted upon affine rectification of detected texture are found to be not only class-discriminative but also complementary to features without rectification, improving recognition performance on the 67-category MIT benchmark of indoor scenes. One of our configurations involving deep ConvNet features outperforms most current state-of-the-art work on this dataset, achieving a classification accuracy of 76.90%. The approach is additionally validated on a set of 31 categories (mostly outdoor man-made environments exhibiting regular, repeating structure), being a subset of the large-scale Places2 scene dataset.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1078-2	Shahzor Ahmad, Loong-Fah Cheong
SDF-2-SDF Registration for Real-Time 3D Reconstruction from RGB-D Data.	We tackle the task of dense 3D reconstruction from RGB-D data. Contrary to the majority of existing methods, we focus not only on trajectory estimation accuracy, but also on reconstruction precision. The key technique is SDF-2-SDF registration, which is a correspondence-free, symmetric, dense energy minimization method, performed via the direct voxel-wise difference between a pair of signed distance fields. It has a wider convergence basin than traditional point cloud registration and cloud-to-volume alignment techniques. Furthermore, its formulation allows for straightforward incorporation of photometric and additional geometric constraints. We employ SDF-2-SDF registration in two applications. First, we perform small-to-medium scale object reconstruction entirely on the CPU. To this end, the camera is tracked frame-to-frame in real time. Then, the initial pose estimates are refined globally in a lightweight optimization framework, which does not involve a pose graph. We combine these procedures into our second, fully real-time application for larger-scale object reconstruction and SLAM. It is implemented as a hybrid system, whereby tracking is done on the GPU, while refinement runs concurrently over batches on the CPU. To bound memory and runtime footprints, registration is done over a fixed number of limited-extent volumes, anchored at geometry-rich locations. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation of both trajectory accuracy and model fidelity on several public RGB-D datasets, acquired with various quality sensors, demonstrates higher precision than related techniques.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1057-z	Miroslava Slavcheva, Wadim Kehl, Nassir Navab, Slobodan Ilic
Scale-Free Registrations in 3D: 7 Degrees of Freedom with Fourier Mellin SOFT Transforms.	Fourier Mellin SOFT (FMS) as a novel method for global registration of 3D data is presented. It determines the seven degrees of freedom (7-DoF) transformation, i.e., the 6-DoF rigid motion parameters plus 1-DoF scale, between two scans, i.e., two noisy, only partially overlapping views on objects or scenes. It is based on a sequence of the 3D Fourier transform, the Mellin transform and the SO(3) Fourier transform. This combination represents a non-trivial complete 3D extension of the well known Fourier-Mellin registration for 2D images. It is accordingly based on decoupling rotation and scale from translation. First, rotation—which is the main challenge for the extension to 3D data - is tackled with a SO(3) Fourier Transform (SOFT) based on Spherical Harmonics. In a second step, scale is determined via a 3D Mellin transform. Finally, translation is calculated by Phase-Matching. Experiments are presented with simulated data sets for ground truth comparisons and with real world data including object recognition and localization in Magnetic Resonance Tomography (MRT) data, registration of 2.5D RGBD scans from a Microsoft Kinect with a scale-free 3D model generated by Multi-View Vision, and 3D mapping by registration of a sequence of consecutive scans from a low-cost actuated Laser Range Finder. The results show that the method is fast and that it can robustly handle partial overlap, interfering structures, and noise. It is also shown that the method is a very interesting option for 6-DoF registration, i.e., when scale is known.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1067-5	Heiko Bülow, Andreas Birk
Semantic Foggy Scene Understanding with Synthetic Data.	This work addresses the problem of semantic foggy scene understanding (SFSU). Although extensive research has been performed on image dehazing and on semantic scene understanding with clear-weather images, little attention has been paid to SFSU. Due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating foggy images, we choose to generate synthetic fog on real images that depict clear-weather outdoor scenes, and then leverage these partially synthetic data for SFSU by employing state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNN). In particular, a complete pipeline to add synthetic fog to real, clear-weather images using incomplete depth information is developed. We apply our fog synthesis on the Cityscapes dataset and generate Foggy Cityscapes with 20,550 images. SFSU is tackled in two ways: (1) with typical supervised learning, and (2) with a novel type of semi-supervised learning, which combines (1) with an unsupervised supervision transfer from clear-weather images to their synthetic foggy counterparts. In addition, we carefully study the usefulness of image dehazing for SFSU. For evaluation, we present Foggy Driving, a dataset with 101 real-world images depicting foggy driving scenes, which come with ground truth annotations for semantic segmentation and object detection. Extensive experiments show that (1) supervised learning with our synthetic data significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art CNN for SFSU on Foggy Driving; (2) our semi-supervised learning strategy further improves performance; and (3) image dehazing marginally advances SFSU with our learning strategy. The datasets, models and code are made publicly available.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1072-8	Christos Sakaridis, Dengxin Dai, Luc Van Gool
Semi-supervised Region Metric Learning for Person Re-identification.	In large-scale camera networks, label information for person re-identification is usually not available under a large amount of cameras due to expensive human labor efforts. Semi-supervised learning could be employed to train a discriminative classifier by using unlabeled data and unmatched image pairs (negatives) generated from non-overlapping camera views, but existing methods suffer from the problem of imbalanced unlabeled data. In this context, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised region metric learning method to improve person re-identification performance under imbalanced unlabeled data. Firstly, instead of seeking for matched image pairs (positives) from the unlabeled data, we propose to estimate positive neighbors by label propagation with cross person score distribution alignment. Secondly, multiple positive regions are generated using sets of positive neighbors to learn a discriminative region-to-point metric. Experimental results demonstrate that the superiority of the proposed method over existing unsupervised, semi-supervised and person re-identification methods.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1075-5	Jiawei Li, Andy Jinhua Ma, Pong C.

Separable Anisotropic Diffusion.	Anisotropic diffusion has many applications in image processing, but the high computational cost usually requires accuracy trade-offs in order to grant its applicability in practical problems. This is specially true when dealing with 3D images, where anisotropic diffusion should be able to provide interesting results for many applications, but the usual implementation methods greatly scale in complexity with the additional dimension. Here we propose a separable implementation of the most general anisotropic diffusion formulation, based on Gaussian convolutions, whose favorable computational complexity scales linearly with the number of dimensions, without any assumptions about specific parameterizations. We also present variants that bend the Gaussian kernels for improved results when dealing with highly anisotropic curved or sharp structures. We test the accuracy, speed, stability, and scale-space properties of the proposed methods, and present some results (both synthetic and real) which show their advantages, including up to 60 times faster computation in 3D with respect to the explicit method, improved accuracy and stability, and min–max preservation.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1060-4	Roi Méndez-Rial, Julio Martín-Herrero
Sim4CV: A Photo-Realistic Simulator for Computer Vision Applications.	We present a photo-realistic training and evaluation simulator (Sim4CV) (http://www.sim4cv.org) with extensive applications across various fields of computer vision. Built on top of the Unreal Engine, the simulator integrates full featured physics based cars, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and animated human actors in diverse urban and suburban 3D environments. We demonstrate the versatility of the simulator with two case studies: autonomous UAV-based tracking of moving objects and autonomous driving using supervised learning. The simulator fully integrates both several state-of-the-art tracking algorithms with a benchmark evaluation tool and a deep neural network architecture for training vehicles to drive autonomously. It generates synthetic photo-realistic datasets with automatic ground truth annotations to easily extend existing real-world datasets and provides extensive synthetic data variety through its ability to reconfigure synthetic worlds on the fly using an automatic world generation tool.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1073-7	Matthias Müller, Vincent Casser, Jean Lahoud, Neil Smith, Bernard Ghanem
Space-Time Tree Ensemble for Action Recognition and Localization.	Human actions are, inherently, structured patterns of body movements. We explore ensembles of hierarchical spatio-temporal trees, discovered directly from training data, to model these structures for action recognition and spatial localization. Discovery of frequent and discriminative tree structures is challenging due to the exponential search space, particularly if one allows partial matching. We address this by first building a concise action word vocabulary via discriminative clustering of the hierarchical space-time segments, which is a two-level video representation that captures both static and non-static relevant space-time segments of the video. Using this vocabulary we then utilize tree mining with subsequent tree clustering and ranking to select a compact set of discriminative tree patterns. Our experiments show that these tree patterns, alone, or in combination with shorter patterns (action words and pairwise patterns) achieve promising performance on three challenging datasets: UCF Sports, HighFive and Hollywood3D. Moreover, we perform cross-dataset validation, using trees learned on HighFive to recognize the same actions in Hollywood3D, and using trees learned on UCF-Sports to recognize and localize the similar actions in JHMDB. The results demonstrate the potential for cross-dataset generalization of the trees our approach discovers.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-016-0980-8	Shugao Ma, Jianming Zhang, Stan Sclaroff, Nazli Ikizler-Cinbis, Leonid Sigal
Subjects and Their Objects: Localizing Interactees for a Person-Centric View of Importance.	"Understanding images with people often entails understanding their interactions with other objects or people. As such, given a novel image, a vision system ought to infer which other objects/people play an important role in a given person's activity. However, existing methods are limited to learning action-specific interactions (e.g., how the pose of a tennis player relates to the position of his racquet when serving the ball) for improved recognition, making them unequipped to reason about novel interactions with actions or objects unobserved in the training data. We propose to predict the ""interactee"" in novel images—that is, to localize the object of a person's action. Given an arbitrary image with a detected person, the goal is to produce a saliency map indicating the most likely positions and scales where that person's interactee would be found. To that end, we explore ways to learn the generic, action-independent connections between (a) representations of a person's pose, gaze, and scene cues and (b) the interactee object's position and scale. We provide results on a newly collected UT Interactee dataset spanning more than 10,000 images from SUN, PASCAL, and COCO. We show that the proposed interaction-informed saliency metric has practical utility for four tasks: contextual object detection, image retargeting, predicting object importance, and data-driven natural language scene description. All four scenarios reveal the value in linking the subject to its object in order to understand the story of an image."	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-016-0958-6	Chao-Yeh Chen, Kristen Grauman
Subspace Learning by ℓ0-Induced Sparsity.	"Subspace clustering methods partition the data that lie in or close to a union of subspaces in accordance with the subspace structure. Such methods with sparsity prior, such as sparse subspace clustering (SSC) (Elhamifar and Vidal in IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell 35(11):2765–2781, 2013) with the sparsity induced by the \ell ^{1}
-norm, are demonstrated to be effective in subspace clustering. Most of those methods require certain assumptions, e.g. independence or disjointness, on the subspaces. However, these assumptions are not guaranteed to hold in practice and they limit the application of existing sparse subspace clustering methods. In this paper, we propose \ell ^{0}
-induced sparse subspace clustering (\ell ^{0}
-SSC). In contrast to the required assumptions, such as independence or disjointness, on subspaces for most existing sparse subspace clustering methods, we prove that \ell ^{0}
-SSC guarantees the subspace-sparse representation, a key element in subspace clustering, for arbitrary distinct underlying subspaces almost surely under the mild i.i.d. assumption on the data generation. We also present the ""no free lunch"" theorem which shows that obtaining the subspace representation under our general assumptions can not be much computationally cheaper than solving the corresponding \ell ^{0}
sparse representation problem of \ell ^{0}
-SSC. A novel approximate algorithm named Approximate \ell ^{0}
-SSC (A\ell ^{0}
-SSC) is developed which employs proximal gradient descent to obtain a sub-optimal solution to the optimization problem of \ell ^{0}
-SSC with theoretical guarantee. The sub-optimal solution is used to build a sparse similarity matrix upon which spectral clustering is performed for the final clustering results. Extensive experimental results on various data sets demonstrate the superiority of A\ell ^{0}
-SSC compared to other competing clustering methods. Furthermore, we extend \ell ^{0}
-SSC to semi-supervised learning by performing label propagation on the sparse similarity matrix learnt by A\ell ^{0}
-SSC and demonstrate the effectiveness of the resultant semi-supervised learning method termed \ell ^{0}
-sparse subspace label propagation (\ell ^{0}

Synthesizing a Scene-Specific Pedestrian Detector and Pose Estimator for Static Video Surveillance - Can We Learn Pedestrian Detectors and Pose Estimators Without Real Data?	"We consider scenarios where we have zero instances of real pedestrian data (e.g., a newly installed surveillance system in a novel location in which no labeled real data or unsupervised real data exists yet) and a pedestrian detector must be developed prior to any observations of pedestrians. Given a single image and auxiliary scene information in the form of camera parameters and geometric layout of the scene, our approach infers and generates a large variety of geometrically and photometrically accurate potential images of synthetic pedestrians along with purely accurate ground-truth labels through the use of computer graphics rendering engine. We first present an efficient discriminative learning method that takes these synthetic renders and generates a unique spatially-varying and geometry-preserving pedestrian appearance classifier customized for every possible location in the scene. In order to extend our approach to multi-task learning for further analysis (i.e., estimating pose and segmentation of pedestrians besides detection), we build a more generalized model employing a fully convolutional neural network architecture for multi-task learning leveraging the ""free"" ground-truth annotations that can be obtained from our pedestrian synthesizer. We demonstrate that when real human annotated data is scarce or non-existent, our data generation strategy can provide an excellent solution for an array of tasks for human activity analysis including detection, pose estimation and segmentation. Experimental results show that our approach (1) outperforms classical models and hybrid synthetic-real models, (2) outperforms various combinations of off-the-shelf state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors and pose estimators that are trained on real data, and (3) surprisingly, our method using purely synthetic data is able to outperform models trained on real scene-specific data when data is limited."	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1077-3	Hironori Hattori, Namhoon Lee, Vishnu Naresh Boddeti, Fares Beainy, Kris M.

Top-Down Neural Attention by Excitation Backprop.	We aim to model the top-down attention of a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier for generating task-specific attention maps. Inspired by a top-down human visual attention model, we propose a new backpropagation scheme, called Excitation Backprop, to pass along top-down signals downwards in the network hierarchy via a probabilistic Winner-Take-All process. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of contrastive attention to make the top-down attention maps more discriminative. We show a theoretic connection between the proposed contrastive attention formulation and the Class Activation Map computation. Efficient implementation of Excitation Backprop for common neural network layers is also presented. In experiments, we visualize the evidence of a model's classification decision by computing the proposed top-down attention maps. For quantitative evaluation, we report the accuracy of our method in weakly supervised localization tasks on the MS COCO, PASCAL VOC07 and ImageNet datasets. The usefulness of our method is further validated in the text-to-region association task. On the Flickr30k Entities dataset, we achieve promising performance in phrase localization by leveraging the top-down attention of a CNN model that has been trained on weakly labeled web images. Finally, we demonstrate applications of our method in model interpretation and data annotation assistance for facial expression analysis and medical imaging tasks.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1059-x	Jianming Zhang, Sarah Adel Bargal, Zhe Lin, Jonathan Brandt, Xiaohui Shen, Stan Sclaroff
Toward Personalized Modeling: Incremental and Ensemble Alignment for Sequential Faces in the Wild.	Fitting facial landmarks on unconstrained videos is a challenging task with broad applications. Both generic and joint alignment methods have been proposed with varying degrees of success. However, many generic methods are heavily sensitive to initializations and usually rely on offline-trained static models, which limit their performance on sequential images with extensive variations. On the other hand, joint methods are restricted to offline applications, since they require all frames to conduct batch alignment. To address these limitations, we propose to exploit incremental learning for personalized ensemble alignment. We sample multiple initial shapes to achieve image congealing within one frame, which enables us to incrementally conduct ensemble alignment by group-sparse regularized rank minimization. At the same time, incremental subspace adaptation is performed to achieve personalized modeling in a unified framework. To alleviate the drifting issue, we leverage a very efficient fitting evaluation network to pick out well-aligned faces for robust incremental learning. Extensive experiments on both controlled and unconstrained datasets have validated our approach in different aspects and demonstrated its superior performance compared with state of the arts in terms of fitting accuracy and efficiency.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-0996-8	Xi Peng, Shaoting Zhang, Yang Yu, Dimitris N.

Transferring Deep Object and Scene Representations for Event Recognition in Still Images.	This paper addresses the problem of image-based event recognition by transferring deep representations learned from object and scene datasets. First we empirically investigate the correlation of the concepts of object, scene, and event, thus motivating our representation transfer methods. Based on this empirical study, we propose an iterative selection method to identify a subset of object and scene classes deemed most relevant for representation transfer. Afterwards, we develop three transfer techniques: (1) initialization-based transfer, (2) knowledge-based transfer, and (3) data-based transfer. These newly designed transfer techniques exploit multitask learning frameworks to incorporate extra knowledge from other networks or additional datasets into the fine-tuning procedure of event CNNs. These multitask learning frameworks turn out to be effective in reducing the effect of over-fitting and improving the generalization ability of the learned CNNs. We perform experiments on four event recognition benchmarks: the ChaLearn LAP Cultural Event Recognition dataset, the Web Image Dataset for Event Recognition, the UIUC Sports Event dataset, and the Photo Event Collection dataset. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm successfully transfers object and scene representations towards the event dataset and achieves the current state-of-the-art performance on all considered datasets.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1043-5	Limin Wang, Zhe Wang, Yu Qiao, Luc Van Gool
Unconstrained Still/Video-Based Face Verification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.	Over the last 5 years, methods based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have shown impressive performance improvements for object detection and recognition problems. This has been made possible due to the availability of large annotated datasets, a better understanding of the non-linear mapping between input images and class labels as well as the affordability of GPUs. In this paper, we present the design details of a deep learning system for unconstrained face recognition, including modules for face detection, association, alignment and face verification. The quantitative performance evaluation is conducted using the IARPA Janus Benchmark A (IJB-A), the JANUS Challenge Set 2 (JANUS CS2), and the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. The IJB-A dataset includes real-world unconstrained faces of 500 subjects with significant pose and illumination variations which are much harder than the LFW and Youtube Face datasets. JANUS CS2 is the extended version of IJB-A which contains not only all the images/frames of IJB-A but also includes the original videos. Some open issues regarding DCNNs for face verification problems are then discussed.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1029-3	Jun-Cheng Chen, Rajeev Ranjan, Swami Sankaranarayanan, Amit Kumar, Ching-Hui Chen, Vishal M.

Virtual Training for a Real Application: Accurate Object-Robot Relative Localization Without Calibration.	Localizing an object accurately with respect to a robot is a key step for autonomous robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose to tackle this task knowing only 3D models of the robot and object in the particular case where the scene is viewed from uncalibrated cameras—a situation which would be typical in an uncontrolled environment, e.g., on a construction site. We demonstrate that this localization can be performed very accurately, with millimetric errors, without using a single real image for training, a strong advantage since acquiring representative training data is a long and expensive process. Our approach relies on a classification Convolutional Neural Network trained using hundreds of thousands of synthetically rendered scenes with randomized parameters. To evaluate our approach quantitatively and make it comparable to alternative approaches, we build a new rich dataset of real robot images with accurately localized blocks.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1102-6	Vianney Loing, Renaud Marlet, Mathieu Aubry
Visual Tracking via Subspace Learning: A Discriminative Approach.	Good tracking performance is in general attributed to accurate representation over previously obtained targets and/or reliable discrimination between the target and the surrounding background. In this work, a robust tracker is proposed by integrating the advantages of both approaches. A subspace is constructed to represent the target and the neighboring background, and their class labels are propagated simultaneously via the learned subspace. In addition, a novel criterion is proposed, by taking account of both the reliability of discrimination and the accuracy of representation, to identify the target from numerous target candidates in each frame. Thus, the ambiguity in the class labels of neighboring background samples, which influences the reliability of the discriminative tracking model, is effectively alleviated, while the training set still remains small. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms most state-of-the-art trackers.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-017-1049-z	Yao Sui, Yafei Tang, Li Zhang, Guanghui Wang
What Makes Good Synthetic Training Data for Learning Disparity and Optical Flow Estimation?	The finding that very large networks can be trained efficiently and reliably has led to a paradigm shift in computer vision from engineered solutions to learning formulations. As a result, the research challenge shifts from devising algorithms to creating suitable and abundant training data for supervised learning. How to efficiently create such training data? The dominant data acquisition method in visual recognition is based on web data and manual annotation. Yet, for many computer vision problems, such as stereo or optical flow estimation, this approach is not feasible because humans cannot manually enter a pixel-accurate flow field. In this paper, we promote the use of synthetically generated data for the purpose of training deep networks on such tasks. We suggest multiple ways to generate such data and evaluate the influence of dataset properties on the performance and generalization properties of the resulting networks. We also demonstrate the benefit of learning schedules that use different types of data at selected stages of the training process.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-018-1082-6	Nikolaus Mayer, Eddy Ilg, Philipp Fischer, Caner Hazirbas, Daniel Cremers, Alexey Dosovitskiy, Thomas Brox
