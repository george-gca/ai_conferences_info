3D Bounding Box Estimation Using Deep Learning and Geometry	We present a method for 3D object detection and pose estimation from a single image. In contrast to current techniques that only regress the 3D orientation of an object, our method first regresses relatively stable 3D object properties using a deep convolutional neural network and then combines these estimates with geometric constraints provided by a 2D object bounding box to produce a complete 3D bounding box. The first network output estimates the 3D object orientation using a novel hybrid discrete-continuous loss, which significantly outperforms the L2 loss. The second output regresses the 3D object dimensions, which have relatively little variance compared to alternatives and can often be predicted for many object types. These estimates, combined with the geometric constraints on translation imposed by the 2D bounding box, enable us to recover a stable and accurate 3D object pose. We evaluate our method on the challenging KITTI object detection benchmark [??] both on the official metric of 3D orientation estimation and also on the accuracy of the obtained 3D bounding boxes. Although conceptually simple, our method outperforms more complex and computationally expensive approaches that leverage semantic segmentation, instance level segmentation and flat ground priors [??] and sub-category detection [??][??]. Our discrete-continuous loss also produces state of the art results for 3D viewpoint estimation on the Pascal 3D+ dataset[??].	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Mousavian_3D_Bounding_Box_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Arsalan Mousavian, Dragomir Anguelov, John Flynn, Jana Kosecka
3D Convolutional Neural Networks for Efficient and Robust Hand Pose Estimation From Single Depth Images	We propose a simple, yet effective approach for real-time hand pose estimation from single depth images using three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs). Image based features extracted by 2D CNNs are not directly suitable for 3D hand pose estimation due to the lack of 3D spatial information. Our proposed 3D CNN taking a 3D volumetric representation of the hand depth image as input can capture the 3D spatial structure of the input and accurately regress full 3D hand pose in a single pass. In order to make the 3D CNN robust to variations in hand sizes and global orientations, we perform 3D data augmentation on the training data. Experiments show that our proposed 3D CNN based approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two challenging hand pose datasets, and is very efficient as our implementation runs at over 215 fps on a standard computer with a single GPU.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ge_3D_Convolutional_Neural_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Liuhao Ge, Hui Liang, Junsong Yuan, Daniel Thalmann
"3D Face Morphable Models ""In-The-Wild"""	"3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) are powerful statistical models of 3D facial shape and texture, and among the state-of-the-art methods for reconstructing facial shape from single images. With the advent of new 3D sensors, many 3D facial datasets have been collected containing both neutral as well as expressive faces. However, all datasets are captured under controlled conditions. Thus, even though powerful 3D facial shape models can be learnt from such data, it is difficult to build statistical texture models that are sufficient to reconstruct faces captured in unconstrained conditions (""in-the-wild""). In this paper, we propose the first, to the best of our knowledge, ""in-the-wild"" 3DMM by combining a powerful statistical model of facial shape, which describes both identity and expression, with an ""in-the-wild"" texture model. We show that the employment of such an ""in-the-wild"" texture model greatly simplifies the fitting procedure, because there is no need to optimise with regards to the illumination parameters. Furthermore, we propose a new fast algorithm for fitting the 3DMM in arbitrary images. Finally, we have captured the first 3D facial database with relatively unconstrained conditions and report quantitative evaluations with state-of-the-art performance. Complementary qualitative reconstruction results are demonstrated on standard ""in-the-wild"" facial databases."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Booth_3D_Face_Morphable_CVPR_2017_paper.html	James Booth, Epameinondas Antonakos, Stylianos Ploumpis, George Trigeorgis, Yannis Panagakis, Stefanos Zafeiriou
3D Human Pose Estimation = 2D Pose Estimation + Matching	"We explore 3D human pose estimation from a single RGB image. While many approaches try to directly predict 3D pose from image measurements, we explore a simple architecture that reasons through intermediate 2D pose predictions. Our approach is based on two key observations (1) Deep neural nets have revolutionized 2D pose estimation, producing accurate 2D predictions even for poses with self-occlusions (2) ""Big-data""sets of 3D mocap data are now readily available, making it tempting to ""lift"" predicted 2D poses to 3D through simple memorization (e.g., nearest neighbors). The resulting architecture is straightforward to implement with off-the-shelf 2D pose estimation systems and 3D mocap libraries. Importantly, we demonstratethatsuchmethodsoutperformalmostallstate-of-theart 3D pose estimation systems, most of which directly try to regress 3D pose from 2D measurements."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chen_3D_Human_Pose_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ching-Hang Chen, Deva Ramanan
3D Human Pose Estimation From a Single Image via Distance Matrix Regression	This paper addresses the problem of 3D human pose estimation from a single image. We follow a standard two-step pipeline by first detecting the 2D position of the N body joints, and then using these observations to infer 3D pose. For the first step, we use a recent CNN-based detector. For the second step, most existing approaches perform 2N-to-3N regression of the Cartesian joint coordinates. We show that more precise pose estimates can be obtained by representing both the 2D and 3D human poses using NxN distance matrices, and formulating the problem as a 2D-to-3D distance matrix regression. For learning such a regressor we leverage on simple Neural Network architectures, which by construction, enforce positivity and symmetry of the predicted matrices. The approach has also the advantage to naturally handle missing observations and allowing to hypothesize the position of non-observed joints. Quantitative results on Humaneva and Human3.6M datasets demonstrate consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art. Qualitative evaluation on the images in-the-wild of the LSP dataset, using the regressor learned on Human3.6M, reveals very promising generalization results.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Moreno-Noguer_3D_Human_Pose_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Francesc Moreno-Noguer
3D Menagerie: Modeling the 3D Shape and Pose of Animals	There has been significant work on learning realistic, articulated, 3D models of the human body. In contrast, there are few such models of animals, despite many applications. The main challenge is that animals are much less cooperative than humans. The best human body models are learned from thousands of 3D scans of people in specific poses, which is infeasible with live animals. Consequently, we learn our model from a small set of 3D scans of toy figurines in arbitrary poses. We employ a novel part-based shape model to compute an initial registration to the scans. We then normalize their pose, learn a statistical shape model, and refine the registrations and the model together. In this way, we accurately align animal scans from different quadruped families with very different shapes and poses. With the registration to a common template we learn a shape space representing animals including lions, cats, dogs, horses, cows and hippos. Animal shapes can be sampled from the model, posed, animated, and fit to data. We demonstrate generalization by fitting it to images of real animals including species not seen in training.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zuffi_3D_Menagerie_Modeling_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Silvia Zuffi, Angjoo Kanazawa, David W.

3D Point Cloud Registration for Localization Using a Deep Neural Network Auto-Encoder	We present an algorithm for registration between a large-scale point cloud and a close-proximity scanned point cloud, providing a localization solution that is fully independent of prior information about the initial positions of the two point cloud coordinate systems. The algorithm, denoted LORAX, selects super-points--local subsets of points--and describes the geometric structure of each with a low-dimensional descriptor. These descriptors are then used to infer potential matching regions for an efficient coarse registration process, followed by a fine-tuning stage. The set of super-points is selected by covering the point clouds with overlapping spheres, and then filtering out those of low-quality or nonsalient regions. The descriptors are computed using state-of-the-art unsupervised machine learning, utilizing the technology of deep neural network based auto-encoders. Abstract This novel framework provides a strong alternative to the common practice of using manually designed key-point descriptors for coarse point cloud registration. Utilizing super-points instead of key-points allows the available geometrical data to be better exploited to find the correct transformation. Encoding local 3D geometric structures using a deep neural network auto-encoder instead of traditional descriptors continues the trend seen in other computer vision applications and indeed leads to superior results. The algorithm is tested on challenging point cloud registration datasets, and its advantages over previous approaches as well as its robustness to density changes, noise, and missing data are shown.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Elbaz_3D_Point_Cloud_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Gil Elbaz, Tamar Avraham, Anath Fischer
3D Pose Regression Using Convolutional Neural Networks	3D pose estimation is a key component of many important computer vision tasks like autonomous navigation and robot manipulation. Current state-of-the-art approaches for 3D object pose estimation, like Viewpoints & Keypoints and Render for CNN, solve this problem by discretizing the pose space into bins and solving a pose-classification task. We argue that 3D pose is continuous and can be solved in a regression framework if done with the right representation, data augmentation and loss function. We modify a standard VGG network for the task of 3D pose regression and show competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w5/html/Mahendran_3D_Pose_Regression_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Siddharth Mahendran, Haider Ali, Rene Vidal
3D Shape Segmentation With Projective Convolutional Networks	This paper introduces a deep architecture for segmenting 3D objects into their labeled semantic parts. Our architecture combines image-based Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) and surface-based Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to yield coherent segmentations of 3D shapes. The image-based FCNs are used for efficient view-based reasoning about 3D object parts. Through a special projection layer, FCN outputs are effectively aggregated across multiple views and scales, then are projected onto the 3D object surfaces. Finally, a surface-based CRF combines the projected outputs with geometric consistency cues to yield coherent segmentations. The whole architecture (multi-view FCNs and CRF) is trained end-to-end. Our approach significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in the currently largest segmentation benchmark (ShapeNet). Finally, we demonstrate promising segmentation results on noisy 3D shapes acquired from consumer-grade depth cameras.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kalogerakis_3D_Shape_Segmentation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Evangelos Kalogerakis, Melinos Averkiou, Subhransu Maji, Siddhartha Chaudhuri
3D-Assisted Coarse-To-Fine Extreme-Pose Facial Landmark Detection	We propose a novel 3D-assisted coarse-to-fine extreme-pose facial landmark detection system in this work. For a given face image, our system first refines the face bounding box with landmark locations inferred from a 3D face model generated by a Recurrent 3D Regressor at coarse level. Another R3R is then employed to fit a 3D face model onto the 2D face image cropped with the refined bounding box at fine-scale. 2D landmark locations inferred from the fitted 3D face are further adjusted with the popular 2D regression method, i.e. LBF. The 3D-assisted coarse-to-fine strategy and the 2D adjustment process explicitly ensure both the robustness to extreme face poses and bounding box disturbance and the accuracy towards pixel-level landmark displacement. Extensive experiments on the Menpo Challenge test sets demonstrate the superior performance of our system.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w33/html/Xiao_3D-Assisted_Coarse-To-Fine_Extreme-Pose_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shengtao Xiao, Jianshu Li, Yunpeng Chen, Zhecan Wang, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan, Ashraf Kassim
3DMatch: Learning Local Geometric Descriptors From RGB-D Reconstructions	Matching local geometric features on real-world depth images is a challenging task due to the noisy, low-resolution, and incomplete nature of 3D scan data. These difficulties limit the performance of current state-of-art methods, which are typically based on histograms over geometric properties. In this paper, we present 3DMatch, a data-driven model that learns a local volumetric patch descriptor for establishing correspondences between partial 3D data. To amass training data for our model, we propose a self-supervised feature learning method that leverages the millions of correspondence labels found in existing RGB-D reconstructions. Experiments show that our descriptor is not only able to match local geometry in new scenes for reconstruction, but also generalize to different tasks and spatial scales (e.g. instance-level object model alignment for the Amazon Picking Challenge, and mesh surface correspondence). Results show that 3DMatch consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin.

4D Light Field Superpixel and Segmentation	Superpixel segmentation of 2D image has been widely used in many computer vision tasks. However, limited to the Gaussian imaging principle, there is not a thorough segmentation solution to the ambiguity in defocus and occlusion boundary areas. In this paper, we consider the essential element of image pixel, i.e., rays in the light space and propose light field superpixel (LFSP) segmentation to eliminate the ambiguity. The LFSP is first defined mathematically and then a refocus-invariant metric named LFSP self-similarity is proposed to evaluate the segmentation performance. By building a clique system containing 80 neighbors in light field, a robust refocus-invariant LFSP segmentation algorithm is developed. Experimental results on both synthetic and real light field datasets demonstrate the advantages over the state-of-the-arts in terms of traditional evaluation metrics. Additionally the LFSP self-similarity evaluation under different light field refocus levels shows the refocus-invariance of the proposed algorithm.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhu_4D_Light_Field_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hao Zhu, Qi Zhang, Qing Wang
A C3D-Based Convolutional Neural Network for Frame Dropping Detection in a Single Video Shot	Frame dropping is a type of video manipulation where consecutive frames are deleted to omit content from the original video. Automatically detecting dropped frames across a large archive of videos while maintaining a low false alarm rate is a challenging task in digital video forensics. We propose a new approach for forensic analysis by exploiting the local spatio-temporal relationships within a portion of a video to robustly detect frame removals. In this paper, we propose to adapt the Convolutional 3D Neural Network (C3D) for frame drop detection. In order to further suppress the errors due by the network, we produce a refined video-level confidence score and demonstrate that it is superior to the raw output scores from the network. We conduct experiments on two challenging video datasets containing rapid camera motion and zoom changes. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w28/html/Hoogs_A_C3D-Based_Convolutional_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chengjiang Long; Eric Smith; Arslan Basharat; Anthony Hoogs
A Clever Elimination Strategy for Efficient Minimal Solvers	We present a new insight into the systematic generation of minimal solvers in computer vision, which leads to smaller and faster solvers. Many minimal problem formulations are coupled sets of linear and polynomial equations where image measurements enter the linear equations only. We show that it is useful to solve such systems by first eliminating all the unknowns that do not appear in the linear equations and then extending solutions to the rest of unknowns. This can be generalized to fully non-linear systems by linearization via lifting. We demonstrate that this approach leads to more efficient solvers in three problems of partially calibrated relative camera pose computation with unknown focal length and/or radial distortion. Our approach also generates new interesting constraints on the fundamental matrices of partially calibrated cameras, which were not known before.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kukelova_A_Clever_Elimination_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zuzana Kukelova, Joe Kileel, Bernd Sturmfels, Tomas Pajdla
A Combinatorial Solution to Non-Rigid 3D Shape-To-Image Matching	We propose a combinatorial solution for the problem of non-rigidly matching a 3D shape to 3D image data. To this end, we model the shape as a triangular mesh and allow each triangle of this mesh to be rigidly transformed to achieve a suitable matching to the image. By penalising the distance and the relative rotation between neighbouring triangles our matching compromises between the image and the shape information. In this paper, we resolve two major challenges: Firstly, we address the resulting large and NP-hard combinatorial problem with a suitable graph-theoretic approach. Secondly, we propose an efficient discretisation of the unbounded 6-dimensional Lie group SE(3). To our knowledge this is the first combinatorial formulation for non-rigid 3D shape-to-image matching. In contrast to existing local (gradient descent) optimisation methods, we obtain solutions that do not require a good initialisation and that are within a bound of the optimal solution. We evaluate the proposed combinatorial method on the two problems of non-rigid 3D shape-to-shape and non-rigid 3D shape-to-image registration and demonstrate that it provides promising results.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Bernard_A_Combinatorial_Solution_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Florian Bernard, Frank R.

A Compact DNN: Approaching GoogLeNet-Level Accuracy of Classification and Domain Adaptation	Recently, DNN model compression based on network architecture design, e.g., SqueezeNet, attracted a lot attention. No accuracy drop on image classification is observed on these extremely compact networks, compared to well-known models. An emerging question, however, is whether these model compression techniques hurt DNN's learning ability other than classifying images on a single dataset. Our preliminary experiment shows that these compression methods could degrade domain adaptation (DA) ability, though the classification performance is preserved. Therefore, we propose a new compact network architecture and unsupervised DA method in this paper. The DNN is built on a new basic module Conv-M which provides more diverse feature extractors without significantly increasing parameters. The unified framework of our DA method will simultaneously learn invariance across domains, reduce divergence of feature representations, and adapt label prediction. Our DNN has 4.1M parameters, which is only 6.7% of AlexNet or 59% of GoogLeNet. Experiments show that our DNN obtains GoogLeNet-level accuracy both on classification and DA, and our DA method slightly outperforms previous competitive ones. Put all together, our DA strategy based on our DNN achieves state-of-the-art on sixteen of total eighteen DA tasks on popular Office-31 and Office-Caltech datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wu_A_Compact_DNN_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chunpeng Wu, Wei Wen, Tariq Afzal, Yongmei Zhang, Yiran Chen, Hai (Helen) Li
A Cost-Effective Framework for Automated Vehicle-Pedestrian Near-Miss Detection Through Onboard Monocular Vision	Onboard monocular cameras have been widely deployed in both public transit and personal vehicles. Obtaining vehicle-pedestrian near-miss event data from onboard monocular vision systems may be cost-effective compared with onboard multiple-sensor systems or traffic surveillance videos. But extracting near-misses from onboard monocular vision is challenging and little work has been published. This paper fills the gap by developing a framework to automatically detect vehicle-pedestrian near-misses through onboard monocular vision. The proposed framework can estimate depth and real-world motion information through monocular vision with a moving video background. The experimental results based on processing over 30-hours video data demonstrate the ability of the system to capture near-misses by comparison with the events logged by the Rosco/MobilEye Shield+ system which includes four cameras working cooperatively. The detection overlap rate reaches over 90% with the thresholds properly set.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w9/html/Ke_A_Cost-Effective_Framework_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ruimin Ke, Jerome Lutin, Jerry Spears, Yinhai Wang
A Counter-Forensic Method for CNN-Based Camera Model Identification	An increasing number of digital images are being shared and accessed through websites, media, and social applications. Many of these images have been modified and are not authentic. Recent advances in the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have facilitated the task of analyzing the veracity and authenticity of largely distributed image datasets. We examine in this paper the problem of identifying the camera model or type that was used to take an image and that can be spoofed. Due to the linear nature of CNNs and the high-dimensionality of images, neural networks are vulnerable to attacks with adversarial examples. These examples are imperceptibly different from correctly classified images but are misclassified with high confidence by CNNs. In this paper, we describe a counter-forensic method capable of subtly altering images to change their estimated camera model when they are analyzed by any CNN-based camera model detector. Our method can use both the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) or the Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) to craft these adversarial images and does not require direct access to the CNN. Our results show that even advanced deep learning architectures trained to analyze images and obtain camera model information are still vulnerable to our proposed method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w28/html/Delp_A_Counter-Forensic_Method_CVPR_2017_paper.html	David Guera; Yu Wang; Luca Bondi; Paolo Bestagini; Stefano Tubaro; Edward J.

A Dataset and Exploration of Models for Understanding Video Data Through Fill-In-The-Blank Question-Answering	While deep convolutional neural networks frequently approach or exceed human-level performance in benchmark tasks involving static images, extending this success to moving images is not straightforward. Video understanding is of interest for many applications, including content recommendation, prediction, summarization, event/object detection, and understanding human visual perception. However, many domains lack sufficient data to explore and perfect video models. In order to address the need for a simple, quantitative benchmark for developing and understanding video, we present MovieFIB, a fill-in-the-blank question-answering dataset with over 300,000 examples, based on descriptive video annotations for the visually impaired. In addition to presenting statistics and a description of the dataset, we perform a detailed analysis of 5 different models' predictions, and compare these with human performance. We investigate the relative importance of language, static (2D) visual features, and moving (3D) visual features; the effects of increasing dataset size, the number of frames sampled; and of vocabulary size. We illustrate that: this task is not solvable by a language model alone; our model combining 2D and 3D visual information indeed provides the best result; all models perform significantly worse than human-level. We provide human evaluation for responses given by different models and find that accuracy on the MovieFIB evaluation corresponds well with human judgment. We suggest avenues for improving video models, and hope that the MovieFIB challenge can be useful for measuring and encouraging progress in this very interesting field.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Maharaj_A_Dataset_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tegan Maharaj, Nicolas Ballas, Anna Rohrbach, Aaron Courville, Christopher Pal
A Dataset for Benchmarking Image-Based Localization	A novel dataset for benchmarking image-based localization is presented. With increasing research interests in visual place recognition and localization, several datasets have been published in the past few years. One of the evident limitations of existing datasets is that precise ground truth camera poses of query images are not available in a meaningful 3D metric system. This is in part due to the underlying 3D models of these datasets are reconstructed from Structure from Motion methods. So far little attention has been paid to metric evaluations of localization accuracy. In this paper we address the problem of whether state-of-the-art visual localization techniques can be applied to tasks with demanding accuracy requirements. We acquired training data for a large indoor environment with cameras and a LiDAR scanner. In addition, we collected over 2000 query images with cell phone cameras. Using LiDAR point clouds as a reference, we employed a semi-automatic approach to estimate the 6 degrees of freedom camera poses precisely in the world coordinate system. The proposed dataset enables us to quantitatively assess the performance of various algorithms using a fair and intuitive metric.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Sun_A_Dataset_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xun Sun, Yuanfan Xie, Pei Luo, Liang Wang
A Dataset for Persistent Multi-Target Multi-Camera Tracking in RGB-D	Video surveillance systems are now widely deployed to improve our lives by enhancing safety, security, health monitoring and business intelligence. This has motivated extensive research into automated video analysis. Nevertheless, there is a gap between the focus of contemporary research, and the needs of end users of video surveillance systems. Many existing benchmarks and methodologies focus on narrowly defined problems in detection, tracking, re-identification or recognition. In contrast, end users face higher-level problems such as long-term monitoring of identities in order to build a picture of a person's activity across the course of a day, producing usage statistics of a particular area of space, and that these capabilities should be robust to challenges such as change of clothing. To achieve this effectively requires less widely studied capabilities such as spatio-temporal reasoning about people identities and locations within a space partially observed by multiple cameras over an extended time period. To bridge this gap between research and required capabilities, we propose a new dataset LIMA that encompasses the challenges of monitoring a typical home / office environment. LIMA contains 4.5 hours of RGB-D video from three cameras monitoring a four room house. To reflect the challenges of a realistic practical application, the dataset includes clothes changes and visitors to ensure the global reasoning is a realistic open-set problem. In addition to raw data, we provide identity annotation for benchmarking, and tracking results from a contemporary RGB-D tracker - thus allowing focus on the higher level monitoring problems.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w17/html/Layne_A_Dataset_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ryan Layne, Sion Hannuna, Massimo Camplani, Jake Hall, Timothy M.

A Deep Convolutional Neural Network With Selection Units for Super-Resolution	Rectified linear units (ReLU) are known to be effective in many deep learning methods. Inspired by linear-mapping technique used in other super-resolution (SR) methods, we reinterpret ReLU into point-wise multiplication of an identity mapping and a switch, and finally present a novel nonlinear unit, called a selection unit (SU). While conventional ReLU has no direct control through which data is passed, the proposed SU optimizes this on-off switching control, and is therefore capable of better handling nonlinearity functionality than ReLU in a more flexible way. Our proposed deep network with SUs, called SelNet, was top-5th ranked in NTIRE2017 Challenge, which has a much lower computation complexity compared to the top-4 entries. Further experiment results show that our proposed SelNet outperforms our baseline only with ReLU (without SUs), and other state-of-the-art deep-learning-based SR methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w12/html/Choi_A_Deep_Convolutional_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jae-Seok Choi, Munchurl Kim
A Deep Regression Architecture With Two-Stage Re-Initialization for High Performance Facial Landmark Detection	Regression based facial landmark detection methods usually learns a series of regression functions to update the landmark positions from an initial estimation. Most of existing approaches focus on learning effective mapping functions with robust image features to improve performance. The approach to dealing with the initialization issue, however, receives relatively fewer attentions. In this paper, we present a deep regression architecture with two-stage re-initialization to explicitly deal with the initialization problem. At the global stage, given an image with a rough face detection result, the full face region is firstly re-initialized by a supervised spatial transformer network to a canonical shape state and then trained to regress a coarse landmark estimation. At the local stage, different face parts are further separately re-initialized to their own canonical shape states, followed by another regression subnetwork to get the final estimation. Our proposed deep architecture is trained from end to end and obtains promising results using different kinds of unstable initialization. It also achieves superior performances over many competing algorithms.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lv_A_Deep_Regression_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jiangjing Lv, Xiaohu Shao, Junliang Xing, Cheng Cheng, Xi Zhou
A Domain Based Approach to Social Relation Recognition	Social relations are the foundation of human daily life. Developing techniques to analyze such relations from visual data bears great potential to build machines that better understand us and are capable of interacting with us at a social level. Previous investigations have remained partial due to the overwhelming diversity and complexity of the topic and consequently have only focused on a handful of social relations. In this paper, we argue that the domain-based theory from social psychology is a great starting point to systematically approach this problem. The theory provides coverage of all aspects of social relations and equally is concrete and predictive about the visual attributes and behaviors defining the relations included in each domain. We provide the first dataset built on this holistic conceptualization of social life that is composed of a hierarchical label space of social domains and social relations. We also contribute the first models to recognize such domains and relations and find superior performance for attribute based features. Beyond the encouraging performance of the attribute based approach, we also find interpretable features that are in accordance with the predictions from social psychology literature. Beyond our findings, we believe that our contributions more tightly interleave visual recognition and social psychology theory that has the potential to complement the theoretical work in the area with empirical and data-driven models of social life.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Sun_A_Domain_Based_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Qianru Sun, Bernt Schiele, Mario Fritz
A Dual Ascent Framework for Lagrangean Decomposition of Combinatorial Problems	We propose a general dual ascent (message passing) framework for Lagrangean (dual) decomposition of combinatorial problems. Although methods of this type have shown their efficiency for a number of problems, so far there was no general algorithm applicable to multiple problem types. In this work, we propose such a general algorithm. It depends on several parameters, which can be used to optimize its performance in each particular setting. We demonstrate efficiency of our method on the graph matching and the multicut problems, where it outperforms state-of-the-art solvers including those based on the subgradient optimization and off-the-shelf linear programming solvers.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Swoboda_A_Dual_Ascent_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Paul Swoboda, Jan Kuske, Bogdan Savchynskyy
A Fast Approximate Spectral Unmixing Algorithm Based on Segmentation	Efficient processing of spectral unmixing is a challenging problem in high-resolution satellite data analysis. The decomposition of a pixel into a linear combination of pure spectra into their corresponding proportions is often very time-consuming. In this paper, a fast unmixing algorithm is proposed based on classifying pixels into a full unmixing group for subset selection requiring intensive computational procedures and a partial unmixing group for proportion estimation with known spectra endmembers. The classification is based on n-band spectral segmentation using the quick-shift algorithm. A subset selection algorithm applied on real satellite data evaluates accuracy and approximation, and experimental results show significant performance acceleration compared with the original algorithm. Parallelization strategies are also presented and verified on NVIDIA GTX TITAN X.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w3/html/Ke_A_Fast_Approximate_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jing Ke, Yi Guo, Arcot Sowmya
A General Framework for Curve and Surface Comparison and Registration With Oriented Varifolds	This paper introduces a general setting for the construction of data fidelity metrics between oriented or non-oriented geometric shapes like curves, curve sets or surfaces. These metrics are based on the representation of shapes as distributions of their local tangent or normal vectors and the definition of reproducing kernels on these spaces. The construction, that combines in one common setting and extends the previous frameworks of currents and varifolds, provides a very large class of kernel metrics which can be easily computed without requiring any kind of parametrization of shapes and which are smooth enough to give robustness to certain imperfections that could result e.g. from bad segmentation. We then give a sense, with synthetic examples, of the versatility and potentialities of such metrics when used in various problems like shape comparison, clustering and diffeomorphic registration.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kaltenmark_A_General_Framework_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Irene Kaltenmark, Benjamin Charlier, Nicolas Charon
A Generative Model for Depth-Based Robust 3D Facial Pose Tracking	We consider the problem of depth-based robust 3D facial pose tracking under unconstrained scenarios with heavy occlusions and arbitrary facial expression variations. Unlike the previous depth-based discriminative or data-driven methods that require sophisticated training or manual intervention, we propose a generative framework that unifies pose tracking and face model adaptation on-the-fly. Particularly, we propose a statistical 3D face model that owns the flexibility to generate and predict the distribution and uncertainty underlying the face model. Moreover, unlike prior arts employing the ICP-based facial pose estimation, we propose a ray visibility constraint that regularizes the pose based on the face model's visibility against the input point cloud, which augments the robustness against the occlusions. The experimental results on Biwi and ICT-3DHP datasets reveal that the proposed framework is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art depth-based methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Sheng_A_Generative_Model_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Lu Sheng, Jianfei Cai, Tat-Jen Cham, Vladimir Pavlovic, King Ngi Ngan
A Gift From Knowledge Distillation: Fast Optimization, Network Minimization and Transfer Learning	We introduce a novel technique for knowledge transfer, where knowledge from a pretrained deep neural network (DNN) is distilled and transferred to another DNN. As the DNN performs a mapping from the input space to the output space through many layers sequentially, we define the distilled knowledge to be transferred in terms of flow between layers, which is calculated by computing the inner product between features from two layers. When we compare the student DNN and the original network with the same size as the student DNN but trained without a teacher network, the proposed method of transferring the distilled knowledge as the flow between two layers exhibits three important phenomena : (1) the student DNN that learns the distilled knowledge is optimized much faster than the original model; (2) the student DNN outperforms the original DNN; and (3) the student DNN can learn the distilled knowledge from a teacher DNN that is trained at a different task, and the student DNN outperforms the original DNN that is trained from scratch.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yim_A_Gift_From_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Junho Yim, Donggyu Joo, Jihoon Bae, Junmo Kim
A Graph Regularized Deep Neural Network for Unsupervised Image Representation Learning	Deep Auto-Encoder (DAE) has shown its promising power in high-level representation learning. From the perspective of manifold learning, we propose a graph regularized deep neural network (GR-DNN) to endue traditional DAEs with the ability of retaining local geometric structure. A deep-structured regularizer is formulated upon multi-layer perceptions to capture this structure. The robust and discriminative embedding space is learned to simultaneously preserve the high-level semantics and the geometric structure within local manifold tangent space. Theoretical analysis presents the close relationship between the proposed graph regularizer and the graph Laplacian regularizer in terms of the optimization objective. We also alleviate the growth of the network complexity by introducing the anchor-based bipartite graph, which guarantees the good scalability for large scale data. The experiments on four datasets show the comparable results of the proposed GR-DNN with the state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yang_A_Graph_Regularized_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shijie Yang, Liang Li, Shuhui Wang, Weigang Zhang, Qingming Huang
A Hierarchical Approach for Generating Descriptive Image Paragraphs	Recent progress on image captioning has made it possible to generate novel sentences describing images in natural language, but compressing an image into a single sentence can describe visual content in only coarse detail. While one new captioning approach, dense captioning, can potentially describe images in finer levels of detail by captioning many regions within an image, it in turn is unable to produce a coherent story for an image. In this paper we overcome these limitations by generating entire paragraphs for describing images, which can tell detailed, unified stories. We develop a model that decomposes both images and paragraphs into their constituent parts, detecting semantic regions in images and using a hierarchical recurrent neural network to reason about language. Linguistic analysis confirms the complexity of the paragraph generation task, and thorough experiments on a new dataset of image and paragraph pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Krause_A_Hierarchical_Approach_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jonathan Krause, Justin Johnson, Ranjay Krishna, Li Fei-Fei
A Joint Speaker-Listener-Reinforcer Model for Referring Expressions	Referring expressions are natural language constructions used to identify particular objects within a scene. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for the tasks of referring expression comprehension and generation. Our model is composed of three modules: speaker, listener, and reinforcer. The speaker generates referring expressions, the listener comprehends referring expressions, and the reinforcer introduces a reward function to guide sampling of more discriminative expressions. The listener-speaker modules are trained jointly in an end-to-end learning framework, allowing the modules to be aware of one another during learning while also benefiting from the discriminative reinforcer's feedback. We demonstrate that this unified framework and training achieves state-of-the-art results for both comprehension and generation on three referring expression datasets.

A Large and Diverse Dataset for Improved Vehicle Make and Model Recognition	Vehicle Make and Model Recognition (VMMR) has evolved into a significant subject of study due to its importance in numerous Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and its components such as Automated Vehicular Surveillance (AVS). A highly accurate and real-time VMMR system significantly reduces the overhead cost of resources other-wise required. The VMMR problem is a multi-class classification task with a peculiar set of issues and challenges like multiplicity, inter- and intra-make ambiguity among various classes, which need to be solved in an efficient and reliable manner to achieve a highly robust VMMR system. In this paper, facing the growing importance of make and model recognition of vehicles, we present a dataset with 9170 different classes of vehicles to advance the corresponding tasks. Extensive experiments conducted using baseline approaches yield superior results for images that were occluded, under low illumination or partial camera views, available in our VMMR dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w9/html/Tafazzoli_A_Large_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Faezeh Tafazzoli, Hichem Frigui, Keishin Nishiyama
A Level Set Method for Gland Segmentation	Histopathology plays a role as the gold standard in clinic for disease diagnosis. The identification and segmentation of histological structures are the prerequisite to disease diagnosis. With the advent of digital pathology, researchers' attention is attracted by the analysis of digital pathology images. In order to relieve the workload on pathologists, a robust segmentation method is needed in clinic for computer-assisted diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a level set framework to achieve gland image segmentation. The input image is divided into two parts, which contain glands with lumens and glands without lumens, respectively. Our experiments are performed on the clinical datasets of West China Hospital, Sichuan University. The experimental results show that our method can deal with glands without lumens, thus can obtain a better performance.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w8/html/Wang_A_Level_Set_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chen Wang, Hong Bu, Ji Bao, Chunming Li
A Linear Extrinsic Calibration of Kaleidoscopic Imaging System From Single 3D Point	This paper proposes a new extrinsic calibration of kaleidoscopic imaging system by estimating normals and distances of the mirrors. The problem to be solved in this paper is a simultaneous estimation of all mirror parameters consistent throughout multiple reflections. Unlike conventional methods utilizing a pair of direct and mirrored images of a reference 3D object to estimate the parameters on a per-mirror basis, our method renders the simultaneous estimation problem into solving a linear set of equations. The key contribution of this paper is to introduce a linear estimation of multiple mirror parameters from kaleidoscopic 2D projections of a single 3D point of unknown geometry. Evaluations with synthesized and real images demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison with conventional methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Takahashi_A_Linear_Extrinsic_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Kosuke Takahashi, Akihiro Miyata, Shohei Nobuhara, Takashi Matsuyama
A Logarithmic X-Ray Imaging Model for Baggage Inspection: Simulation and Object Detection	In baggage inspection the aim is to detect automatically threat objects. The progress in automated baggage inspection, however, is modest and very limited. In this work, we present an X-ray imaging model that can separate foreground from background in baggage screening. In our model, rather than a multiplication of foreground and background, we propose the addition of logarithmic images. This allows the use of linear strategies to superimpose images of threat objects onto X-ray images (simulation) and the use of sparse representations in order segment target objects (detection). In our experiments, we simulate new X-ray images of handguns, shuriken and razor blades, in which it is impossible to distinguish simulated and real X-ray images. In addition, we show in our experiments the effective detection of shuriken, razor blades and handguns using the proposed algorithm.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w3/html/Mery_A_Logarithmic_X-Ray_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Domingo Mery, Aggelos K.

A Low Power, Fully Event-Based Gesture Recognition System	We present the first gesture recognition system implemented end-to-end on event-based hardware, using a TrueNorth neurosynaptic processor to recognize hand gestures in real-time at low power from events streamed live by a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). The biologically inspired DVS transmits data only when a pixel detects a change, unlike traditional frame-based cameras which sample every pixel at a fixed frame rate. This sparse, asynchronous data representation lets event-based cameras operate at much lower power than frame-based cameras. However, much of the energy efficiency is lost if, as in previous work, the event stream is interpreted by conventional synchronous processors. Here, for the first time, we process a live DVS event stream using TrueNorth, a natively event-based processor with 1 million spiking neurons. Configured here as a convolutional neural network (CNN), the TrueNorth chip identifies the onset of a gesture with a latency of 105 ms while consuming less than 200 mW. The CNN achieves 96.5% out-of-sample accuracy on a newly collected DVS dataset (DvsGesture) comprising 11 hand gesture categories from 29 subjects under 3 illumination conditions.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Amir_A_Low_Power_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Arnon Amir, Brian Taba, David Berg, Timothy Melano, Jeffrey McKinstry, Carmelo Di Nolfo, Tapan Nayak, Alexander Andreopoulos, Guillaume Garreau, Marcela Mendoza, Jeff Kusnitz, Michael Debole, Steve Esser, Tobi Delbruck, Myron Flickner, Dharmendra Modha
A Matrix Splitting Method for Composite Function Minimization	Composite function minimization captures a wide spectrum of applications in both computer vision and machine learning. It includes bound constrained optimization and cardinality regularized optimization as special cases. This paper proposes and analyzes a new Matrix Splitting Method (MSM) for minimizing composite functions. It can be viewed as a generalization of the classical Gauss-Seidel method and the Successive Over-Relaxation method for solving linear systems in the literature. Incorporating a new Gaussian elimination procedure, the matrix splitting method achieves state-of-the-art performance. For convex problems, we establish the global convergence, convergence rate, and iteration complexity of MSM, while for non-convex problems, we prove its global convergence. Finally, we validate the performance of our matrix splitting method on two particular applications: nonnegative matrix factorization and cardinality regularized sparse coding. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing composite function minimization techniques in term of both efficiency and efficacy.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yuan_A_Matrix_Splitting_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ganzhao Yuan, Wei-Shi Zheng, Bernard Ghanem
A Message Passing Algorithm for the Minimum Cost Multicut Problem	We propose a dual decomposition and linear program relaxation of the NP-hard minimum cost multicut problem. Unlike other polyhedral relaxations of the multicut polytope, it is amenable to efficient optimization by message passing. Like other polyhedral relaxations, it can be tightened efficiently by cutting planes. We define an algorithm that alternates between message passing and efficient separation of cycle- and odd-wheel inequalities. This algorithm is more efficient than state-of-the-art algorithms based on linear programming, including algorithms written in the framework of leading commercial software, as we show in experiments with large instances of the problem from applications in computer vision, biomedical image analysis and data mining.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Swoboda_A_Message_Passing_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Paul Swoboda, Bjoern Andres
A Minimal Solution for Two-View Focal-Length Estimation Using Two Affine Correspondences	A minimal solution using two affine correspondences is presented to estimate the common focal length and the fundamental matrix between two semi-calibrated cameras - known intrinsic parameters except a common focal length. To the best of our knowledge, this problem is unsolved. The proposed approach extends point correspondence-based techniques with linear constraints derived from local affine transformations. The obtained multivariate polynomial system is efficiently solved by the hidden-variable technique. Observing the geometry of local affinities, we introduce novel conditions eliminating invalid roots. To select the best one out of the remaining candidates, a root selection technique is proposed outperforming the recent ones especially in case of high-level noise. The proposed 2-point algorithm is validated on both synthetic data and 104 publicly available real image pairs. A Matlab implementation of the proposed solution is included in the paper.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Barath_A_Minimal_Solution_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Daniel Barath, Tekla Toth, Levente Hajder
A Multi-View Stereo Benchmark With High-Resolution Images and Multi-Camera Videos	Motivated by the limitations of existing multi-view stereo benchmarks, we present a novel dataset for this task. Towards this goal, we recorded a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes using a high-precision laser scanner and captured both high-resolution DSLR imagery as well as synchronized low-resolution stereo videos with varying fields-of-view. To align the images with the laser scans, we propose a robust technique which minimizes photometric errors conditioned on the geometry. In contrast to previous datasets, our benchmark provides novel challenges and covers a diverse set of viewpoints and scene types, ranging from natural scenes to man-made indoor and outdoor environments. Furthermore, we provide data at significantly higher temporal and spatial resolution. Our benchmark is the first to cover the important use case of hand-held mobile devices while also providing high-resolution DSLR camera images. We make our datasets and an online evaluation server available at http://www.eth3d.net.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Schops_A_Multi-View_Stereo_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Thomas Schops, Johannes L.

A New Rank Constraint on Multi-View Fundamental Matrices, and Its Application to Camera Location Recovery	Accurate estimation of camera matrices is an important step in structure from motion algorithms. In this paper we introduce a novel rank constraint on collections of fundamental matrices in multi-view settings. We show that in general, with the selection of proper scale factors, a matrix formed by stacking fundamental matrices between pairs of images has rank 6. Moreover, this matrix forms the symmetric part of a rank 3 matrix whose factors relate directly to the corresponding camera matrices. We use this new characterization to produce better estimations of fundamental matrices by optimizing an L1-cost function using Iterative Re-weighted Least Squares and Alternate Direction Method of Multiplier. We further show that this procedure can improve the recovery of camera locations, particularly in multi-view settings in which fewer images are available.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Sengupta_A_New_Rank_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Soumyadip Sengupta, Tal Amir, Meirav Galun, Tom Goldstein, David W.

A New Representation of Skeleton Sequences for 3D Action Recognition	This paper presents a new method for 3D action recognition with skeleton sequences (i.e., 3D trajectories of human skeleton joints). The proposed method first transforms each skeleton sequence into three clips each consisting of several frames for spatial temporal feature learning using deep neural networks. Each clip is generated from one channel of the cylindrical coordinates of the skeleton sequence. Each frame of the generated clips represents the temporal information of the entire skeleton sequence, and incorporates one particular spatial relationship between the joints. The entire clips include multiple frames with different spatial relationships, which provide useful spatial structural information of the human skeleton. We propose to use deep convolutional neural networks to learn long-term temporal information of the skeleton sequence from the frames of the generated clips, and then use a Multi-Task Learning Network (MTLN) to jointly process all frames of the clips in parallel to incorporate spatial structural information for action recognition. Experimental results clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed new representation and feature learning method for 3D action recognition.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ke_A_New_Representation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Qiuhong Ke, Mohammed Bennamoun, Senjian An, Ferdous Sohel, Farid Boussaid
A Non-Convex Variational Approach to Photometric Stereo Under Inaccurate Lighting	This paper tackles the photometric stereo problem in the presence of inaccurate lighting, obtained either by calibration or by an uncalibrated photometric stereo method. Based on a precise modeling of noise and outliers, a robust variational approach is introduced. It explicitly accounts for self-shadows, and enforces robustness to cast-shadows and specularities by resorting to redescending M-estimators. The resulting non-convex model is solved by means of a computationally efficient alternating reweighted least-squares algorithm. Since it implicitly enforces integrability, the new variational approach can refine both the intensities and the directions of the lighting.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Queau_A_Non-Convex_Variational_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yvain Queau, Tao Wu, Francois Lauze, Jean-Denis Durou, Daniel Cremers
A Non-Local Low-Rank Framework for Ultrasound Speckle Reduction	`Speckle' refers to the granular patterns that occur in ultrasound images due to wave interference. Speckle removal can greatly improve the visibility of the underlying structures in an ultrasound image and enhance subsequent post processing. We present a novel framework for speckle removal based on low-rank non-local filtering. Our approach works by first computing a guidance image that assists in the selection of candidate patches for non-local filtering in the face of significant speckles. The candidate patches are further refined using a low-rank minimization estimated using a truncated weighted nuclear norm (TWNN) and structured sparsity. We show that the proposed filtering framework produces results that outperform state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. This framework also provides better segmentation results when used for pre-processing ultrasound images.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhu_A_Non-Local_Low-Rank_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Lei Zhu, Chi-Wing Fu, Michael S.

A Novel Detection Paradigm and Its Comparison to Statistical and Kernel-Based Anomaly Detection Algorithms for Hyperspectral Imagery	Detection of anomalous pixels within hyperspectral imagery is frequently used for purposes ranging from the location of invasive plant species to the detection of military targets. The task is unsupervised because no information about target or background spectra is known or assumed. Some of the most commonly used detection algorithms assume a statistical distribution for the background and rate spectral anomalousness based on measures of deviation from the statistical model; but such assumptions can be problematic because hyperspectral data rarely meet them. More recent algorithms have employed data-driven machine learning techniques in order to improve performance. Here we investigate a novel kernel-based method and show that it achieves top detection performance relative to seven other state-of-the-art methods on a commonly tested data set.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w3/html/Olson_A_Novel_Detection_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Colin C.

A Novel Tensor-Based Video Rain Streaks Removal Approach via Utilizing Discriminatively Intrinsic Priors	Rain streaks removal is an important issue of the outdoor vision system and has been recently investigated extensively. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor based video rain streaks removal approach by fully considering the discriminatively intrinsic characteristics of rain streaks and clean videos, which needs neither rain detection nor time-consuming dictionary learning stage. In specific, on the one hand, rain streaks are sparse and smooth along the raindrops' direction, and on the other hand, the clean videos possess smoothness along the rain-perpendicular direction and global and local correlation along time direction. We use the l_1 norm to enhance the sparsity of the underlying rain, two unidirectional Total Variation (TV) regularizers to guarantee the different discriminative smoothness, and a tensor nuclear norm and a time directional difference operator to characterize the exclusive correlation of the clean video along time. Alternation direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is employed to solve the proposed concise tensor based convex model. Experiments implemented on synthetic and real data substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Under comprehensive quantitative performance measures, our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Jiang_A_Novel_Tensor-Based_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tai-Xiang Jiang, Ting-Zhu Huang, Xi-Le Zhao, Liang-Jian Deng, Yao Wang
A Point Set Generation Network for 3D Object Reconstruction From a Single Image	Generation of 3D data by deep neural network has been attracting increasing attention in the research community. The majority of extant works resort to regular representations such as volumetric grids or collection of images; however, these representations obscure the natural invariance of 3D shapes under geometric transformations, and also suffer from a number of other issues. In this paper we address the problem of 3D reconstruction from a single image, generating a straight-forward form of output -- point cloud coordinates. Along with this problem arises a unique and interesting issue, that the groundtruth shape for an input image may be ambiguous. Driven by this unorthordox output form and the inherent ambiguity in groundtruth, we design architecture, loss function and learning paradigm that are novel and effective. Our final solution is a conditional shape sampler, capable of predicting multiple plausible 3D point clouds from an input image. In experiments not only can our system outperform state-of-the-art methods on single image based 3D reconstruction benchmarks; but it also shows strong performance for 3D shape completion and promising ability in making multiple plausible predictions.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Fan_A_Point_Set_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Haoqiang Fan, Hao Su, Leonidas J.

A Practical Method for Fully Automatic Intrinsic Camera Calibration Using Directionally Encoded Light	Calibrating the intrinsic properties of a camera is one of the fundamental tasks required for a variety of computer vision and image processing tasks. The precise measurement of focal length, location of the principal point as well as distortion parameters of the lens is crucial, for example, for 3D reconstruction. Although a variety of methods exist to achieve this goal, they are often cumbersome to carry out, require substantial manual interaction, expert knowledge, and a significant operating volume. We propose a novel calibration method based on the usage of directionally encoded light rays for estimating the intrinsic parameters. It enables a fully automatic calibration with a small device mounted close to the front lens element and still enables an accuracy comparable to standard methods even when the lens is focused up to infinity. Our method overcomes the mentioned limitations since it guarantees an accurate calibration without any human intervention while requiring only a limited amount of space. Besides that, the approach also allows to estimate the distance of the focal plane as well as the size of the aperture. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method by evaluating several camera/lens configurations using prototypical devices.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tehrani_A_Practical_Method_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mahdi Abbaspour Tehrani, Thabo Beeler, Anselm Grundhofer
A Reinforcement Learning Approach to the View Planning Problem	We present a Reinforcement Learning (RL) solution to the view planning problem (VPP), which generates a sequence of view points that are capable of sensing all accessible area of a given object represented as a 3D model. In doing so, the goal is to minimize the number of view points, making the VPP a class of set covering optimization problem (SCOP). The SCOP is NP-hard, and the inapproximability results tell us that the greedy algorithm provides the best approximation that runs in polynomial time. In order to find a solution that is better than the greedy algorithm, (i) we introduce a novel score function by exploiting the geometry of the 3D model, (ii) we device an intuitive approach to VPP using this score function, and (iii) we cast VPP as a Markovian Decision Process (MDP), and solve the MDP in RL framework using well-known RL algorithms. In particular, we use SARSA, Watkins-Q and TD with function approximation to solve the MDP. We compare the results of our method with the baseline greedy algorithm in an extensive set of test objects, and show that we can outperform the baseline in almost all cases.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kaba_A_Reinforcement_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mustafa Devrim Kaba, Mustafa Gokhan Uzunbas, Ser Nam Lim
A Riemannian Framework for Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis on the Tangent Space of Shapes	We present a Riemannian framework for linear and quadratic discriminant classification on the tangent plane of the shape space of curves. The shape space is infinite dimensional and is constructed out of square root velocity functions of curves. We introduce the idea of mean and covariance of shape-valued random variables and samples from a tangent space to the pre-shape space (invariant to translation and scaling) and then extend it to the full shape space (rotational invariance). The shape observations from the population are approximated by coefficients of a Fourier basis of the tangent space. The algorithms for linear and quadratic discriminant analysis are then defined using reduced dimensional features obtained by projecting the original shape observations on to the truncated Fourier basis. We show classification results on synthetic data and shapes of cortical sulci, corpus callosum curves, as well as facial midline curve profiles from patients with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w7/html/Pal_A_Riemannian_Framework_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Susovan Pal, Roger P.

A Study of Lagrangean Decompositions and Dual Ascent Solvers for Graph Matching	We study the quadratic assignment problem, in computer vision also known as graph matching. Two leading solvers for this problem optimize the Lagrange decomposition duals with sub-gradient and dual ascent (also known as message passing) updates. We explore this direction further and propose several additional Lagrangean relaxations of the graph matching problem along with corresponding algorithms, which are all based on a common dual ascent framework. Our extensive empirical evaluation gives several theoretical insights and suggests a new state-of-the-art anytime solver for the considered problem. Our improvement over state-of-the-art is particularly visible on a new dataset with large-scale sparse problem instances containing more than 500 graph nodes each.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Swoboda_A_Study_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Paul Swoboda, Carsten Rother, Hassan Abu Alhaija, Dagmar Kainmuller, Bogdan Savchynskyy

While individual results are readily available on the benchmark web page http://www.lightfield-analysis.net, we take this opportunity to give a detailed overview of the current participants. Based on the algorithms submitted to our challenge, we develop a taxonomy of light field disparity estimation algorithms and give a report on the current state-of-the-art.

A Unified Approach of Multi-Scale Deep and Hand-Crafted Features for Defocus Estimation	In this paper, we introduce robust and synergetic hand-crafted features and a simple but efficient deep feature from a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for defocus estimation. This paper systematically analyzes the effectiveness of different features, and shows how each feature can compensate for the weaknesses of other features when they are concatenated. For a full defocus map estimation, we extract image patches on strong edges sparsely, after which we use them for deep and hand-crafted feature extraction. In order to reduce the degree of patch-scale dependency, we also propose a multi-scale patch extraction strategy. A sparse defocus map is generated using a neural network classifier followed by a probability-joint bilateral filter. The final defocus map is obtained from the sparse defocus map with guidance from an edge-preserving filtered input image. Experimental results show that our algorithm is superior to state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of defocus estimation. Our work can be used for applications such as segmentation, blur magnification, all-in-focus image generation, and 3-D estimation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Park_A_Unified_Approach_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jinsun Park, Yu-Wing Tai, Donghyeon Cho, In So Kweon
A Wide-Field-Of-View Monocentric Light Field Camera	Light field (LF) capture and processing are important in an expanding range of computer vision applications, offering rich textural and depth information and simplification of conventionally complex tasks. Although LF cameras are commercially available, no existing device offers wide field-of-view (FOV) imaging. This is due in part to the limitations of fisheye lenses, for which a fundamentally constrained entrance pupil diameter severely limits depth sensitivity. In this work we describe a novel, compact optical design that couples a monocentric lens with multiple sensors using microlens arrays, allowing LF capture with an unprecedented FOV. Leveraging capabilities of the LF representation, we propose a novel method for efficiently coupling the spherical lens and planar sensors, replacing expensive and bulky fiber bundles. We construct a single-sensor LF camera prototype, rotating the sensor relative to a fixed main lens to emulate a wide-FOV multi-sensor scenario. Finally, we describe a processing toolchain, including a convenient spherical LF parameterization, and demonstrate depth estimation and post-capture refocus for indoor and outdoor panoramas with 15 x 15 x 1600 x 200 pixels (72 MPix) and a 138-degree FOV.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Dansereau_A_Wide-Field-Of-View_Monocentric_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Donald G.

A-Fast-RCNN: Hard Positive Generation via Adversary for Object Detection	How do we learn an object detector that is invariant to occlusions and deformations? Our current solution is to use a data-driven strategy -- collect large-scale datasets which have object instances under different conditions. The hope is that the final classifier can use these examples to learn invariances. But is it really possible to see all the occlusions in a dataset? We argue that like categories, occlusions and object deformations also follow a long-tail. Some occlusions and deformations are so rare that they hardly happen; yet we want to learn a model invariant to such occurrences. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution. We propose to learn an adversarial network that generates examples with occlusions and deformations. The goal of the adversary is to generate examples that are difficult for the object detector to classify. In our framework both the original detector and adversary are learned in a joint manner. Our experimental results indicate a 2.3% mAP boost on VOC07 and a 2.6% mAP boost on VOC2012 object detection challenge compared to the Fast-RCNN pipeline.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_A-Fast-RCNN_Hard_Positive_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xiaolong Wang, Abhinav Shrivastava, Abhinav Gupta
A-Lamp: Adaptive Layout-Aware Multi-Patch Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Photo Aesthetic Assessment	Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have recently been shown to generate promising results for aesthetics assessment. However, the performance of these deep CNN methods is often compromised by the constraint that the neural network only takes the fixed-size input. To accommodate this requirement, input images need to be transformed via cropping, warping, or padding, which often alter image composition, reduce image resolution, or cause image distortion. Thus the aesthetics of the original images is impaired because of potential loss of fine grained details and holistic image layout. However, such fine grained details and holistic image layout is critical for evaluating an image's aesthetics. In this paper, we present an Adaptive Layout-Aware Multi-Patch Convolutional Neural Network (A-Lamp CNN) architecture for photo aesthetic assessment. This novel scheme is able to accept arbitrary sized images, and learn from both fined grained details and holistic image layout simultaneously. To enable training on these hybrid inputs, we extend the method by developing a dedicated double-subnet neural network structure, i.e. a Multi-Patch subnet and a Layout-Aware subnet. We further construct an aggregation layer to effectively combine the hybrid features from these two subnets. Extensive experiments on the large-scale aesthetics assessment benchmark (AVA) demonstrate significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art in photo aesthetic assessment.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ma_A-Lamp_Adaptive_Layout-Aware_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shuang Ma, Jing Liu, Chang Wen Chen
AGA: Attribute-Guided Augmentation	We consider the problem of data augmentation, i.e., generating artificial samples to extend a given corpus of training data. Specifically, we propose attributed-guided augmentation (AGA) which learns a mapping that allows to synthesize data such that an attribute of a synthesized sample is at a desired value or strength. This is particularly interesting in situations where little data with no attribute annotation is available for learning, but we have access to a large external corpus of heavily annotated samples. While prior works primarily augment in the space of images, we propose to perform augmentation in feature space instead. We implement our approach as a deep encoder-decoder architecture that learns the synthesis function in an end-to-end manner. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on the problems of (1) one-shot object recognition in a transfer-learning setting where we have no prior knowledge of the new classes, as well as (2) object-based one-shot scene recognition. As external data, we leverage 3D depth and pose information from the SUN RGB-D dataset. Our experiments show that attribute-guided augmentation of high-level CNN features considerably improves one-shot recognition performance on both problems.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Dixit_AGA_Attribute-Guided_Augmentation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mandar Dixit, Roland Kwitt, Marc Niethammer, Nuno Vasconcelos
AMC: Attention guided Multi-modal Correlation Learning for Image Search	Given a user's query, traditional image search systems rank images according to its relevance to a single modality (e.g., image content or surrounding text). Nowadays, an increasing number of images on the Internet are available with associated meta data in rich modalities (e.g., titles, keywords, tags, etc.), which can be exploited for better similarity measure with queries. In this paper, we leverage visual and textual modalities for image search by learning their correlation with input query. According to the intent of query, attention mechanism can be introduced to adaptively balance the importance of different modalities. We propose a novel Attention guided Multi-modal Correlation (AMC) learning method which consists of a jointly learned hierarchy of intra and inter-attention networks. Conditioned on query's intent, intra-attention networks (i.e., visual intra-attention network and language intra-attention network) attend on informative parts within each modality; a multi-modal inter-attention network promotes the importance of the most query-relevant modalities. In experiments, we evaluate AMC models on the search logs from two real world image search engines and show a significant boost on the ranking of user-clicked images in search results. Additionally, we extend AMC models to caption ranking task on COCO dataset and achieve competitive results compared with recent state-of-the-arts.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chen_AMC_Attention_guided_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Kan Chen, Trung Bui, Chen Fang, Zhaowen Wang, Ram Nevatia
AMVH: Asymmetric Multi-Valued Hashing	Most existing hashing methods resort to binary codes for similarity search, owing to the high efficiency of computation and storage. However, binary codes lack enough capability in similarity preservation, resulting in less desirable performance. To address this issue, we propose an asymmetric multi-valued hashing method supported by two different non-binary embeddings. (1) A real-valued embedding is used for representing the newly-coming query. (2) A multi-integer-embedding is employed for compressing the whole database, which is modeled by binary sparse representation with fixed sparsity. With these two non-binary embeddings, the similarities between data points can be preserved precisely. To perform meaningful asymmetric similarity computation for efficient semantic search, these embeddings are jointly learnt by preserving the label-based similarity. Technically, this results in a mixed integer programming problem, which is efficiently solved by alternative optimization. Extensive experiments on three multilabel datasets demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms the existing binary hashing methods in search accuracy, but also retains their query and storage efficiency.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Da_AMVH_Asymmetric_Multi-Valued_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Cheng Da, Shibiao Xu, Kun Ding, Gaofeng Meng, Shiming Xiang, Chunhong Pan
ASePPI: Robust Privacy Protection Against De-Anonymization Attacks	The evolution of the video surveillance systems generates questions concerning protection of individual privacy. In this paper, we design ASePPI, an Adaptive Scrambling enabling Privacy Protection and Intelligibility method operating in the H.264/AVC stream with the aim to be robust against de-anonymization attacks targeting the restoration of the original image and the re-identification of people. The proposed approach automatically adapts the level of protection according to the resolution of the region of interest. Compared to existing methods, our framework provides a better trade-off between the privacy protection and the visibility of the scene with robustness against de-anonymization attacks. Moreover, the impact on the source coding stream is negligible.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w16/html/Dugelay_ASePPI_Robust_Privacy_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Natacha Ruchaud; Jean-Luc Dugelay
Abnormal Event Detection on BMTT-PETS 2017 Surveillance Challenge	In this paper, we have proposed a method to detect abnormal events for human group activities. Our main contribution is to develop a strategy that learns with very few videos by isolating the action and by using supervised learning. First, we subtract the background of each frame by modeling each pixel as a mixture of Gaussians(MoG) to concatenate the higher order learning only on the foreground. Next, features are extracted from each frame using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained to classify between normal and abnormal frames. These feature vectors are fed into long short term memory (LSTM) network to learn the long-term dependencies between frames. The LSTM is also trained to classify abnormal frames, while extracting the temporal features of the frames. Finally, we classify the frames as abnormal or normal depending on the output of a linear SVM, whose input are the features computed by the LSTM.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w34/html/Vignesh_Abnormal_Event_Detection_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Kothapalli Vignesh, Gaurav Yadav, Amit Sethi
AcFR: Active Face Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks	We propose AcFR, an active face recognition system that employs a convolutional neural network and acts consistently with human behaviors in common face recognition scenarios. AcFR comprises two main components--a recognition module and a controller module. The recognition module uses a pre-trained VGG-Face net to extract facial image features along with a nearest neighbor identity recognition algorithm. Based on the results, the controller module can make three different decisions--greet a recognized individual, disregard an unknown individual, or acquire a different viewpoint from which to reassess the subject, all of which are natural reactions when people observe passers-by. Evaluated on the PIE dataset, our recognition module yields higher accuracy on images under closer angles to those saved in memory. The accuracy is viewdependent and it also provides evidence for the proper design of the controller module.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w1/html/Nakada_AcFR_Active_Face_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Masaki Nakada, Han Wang, Demetri Terzopoulos
Accurate Depth and Normal Maps From Occlusion-Aware Focal Stack Symmetry	We introduce a novel approach to jointly estimate consistent depth and normal maps from 4D light fields, with two main contributions. First, we build a cost volume from focal stack symmetry. However, in contrast to previous approaches, we introduce partial focal stacks in order to be able to robustly deal with occlusions. This idea already yields significanly better disparity maps. Second, even recent sublabel-accurate methods for multi-label optimization recover only a piecewise flat disparity map from the cost volume, with normals pointing mostly towards the image plane. This renders normal maps recovered from these approaches unsuitable for potential subsequent applications. We therefore propose regularization with a novel prior linking depth to normals, and imposing smoothness of the resulting normal field. We then jointly optimize over depth and normals to achieve estimates for both which surpass previous work in accuracy on a recent benchmark.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Strecke_Accurate_Depth_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Michael Strecke, Anna Alperovich, Bastian Goldluecke
Accurate Optical Flow via Direct Cost Volume Processing	We present an optical flow estimation approach that operates on the full four-dimensional cost volume. This direct approach shares the structural benefits of leading stereo matching pipelines, which are known to yield high accuracy. To this day, such approaches have been considered impractical due to the size of the cost volume. We show that the full four-dimensional cost volume can be constructed in a fraction of a second due to its regularity. We then exploit this regularity further by adapting semi-global matching to the four-dimensional setting. This yields a pipeline that achieves significantly higher accuracy than state-of-the-art optical flow methods while being faster than most. Our approach outperforms all published general-purpose optical flow methods on both Sintel and KITTI 2015 benchmarks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xu_Accurate_Optical_Flow_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jia Xu, Rene Ranftl, Vladlen Koltun
Accurate Single Stage Detector Using Recurrent Rolling Convolution	"Most of the recent successful methods in accurate object detection and localization used some variants of R-CNN style two stage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) where plausible regions were proposed in the first stage then followed by a second stage for decision refinement. Despite the simplicity of training and the efficiency in deployment, the single stage detection methods have not been as competitive when evaluated in benchmarks consider mAP for high IoU thresholds. In this paper, we proposed a novel single stage end-to-end trainable object detection network to overcome this limitation. We achieved this by introducing Recurrent Rolling Convolution (RRC) architecture over multi-scale feature maps to construct object classifiers and bounding box regressors which are ""deep in context"". We evaluated our method in the challenging KITTI dataset which measures methods under IoU threshold of 0.7. We showed that with RRC, a single reduced VGG-16 based model already significantly outperformed all the previously published results. At the time this paper was written our models ranked the first in KITTI car detection (the hard level), the first in cyclist detection and the second in pedestrian detection. These results were not reached by the previous single stage methods. The code is publicly available."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ren_Accurate_Single_Stage_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jimmy Ren, Xiaohao Chen, Jianbo Liu, Wenxiu Sun, Jiahao Pang, Qiong Yan, Yu-Wing Tai, Li Xu
Accurate and Efficient 3D Human Pose Estimation Algorithm Using Single Depth Images for Pose Analysis in Golf	Human pose analysis has been known to be an effective means to evaluate athlete's performance. Marker-less 3D human pose estimation is one of the most practical methods to acquire human pose but lacks sufficient accuracy required to achieve precise performance analysis for sports. In this paper, we propose a human pose estimation algorithm that utilizes multiple types of random forests to enhance results for sports analysis. Random regression forest voting to localize joints of the athlete's anatomy is followed by random verification forests that evaluate and optimize the votes to improve the accuracy of clustering that determine the final position of anatomic joints. Experiential results show that the proposed algorithm enhances not only accuracy, but also efficiency of human pose estimation. We also conduct the field study to investigate feasibility of the algorithm for sports applications with developed golf swing analyzing system.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w2/html/Park_Accurate_and_Efficient_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Soonchan Park, Ju Yong Chang, Hyuk Jeong, Jae-Ho Lee, Ji-Young Park
Acquiring Axially-Symmetric Transparent Objects Using Single-View Transmission Imaging	We propose a novel, practical solution for high quality reconstruction of axially-symmetric transparent objects. While a special case, such transparent objects are ubiquitous in the real world. Common examples of these are glasses, goblets, tumblers, carafes, etc., that can have very unique and visually appealing forms making their reconstruction interesting for vision and graphics applications. Our acquisition setup involves imaging such objects from a single viewpoint while illuminating them from directly behind with a few patterns emitted by an LCD panel. Our reconstruction step is then based on optimization of the object's geometry and its refractive index to minimize the difference between observed and simulated transmission/refraction of rays passing through the object. We exploit the object's axial symmetry as a strong shape prior which allows us to achieve robust reconstruction from a single viewpoint using a simple, commodity acquisition setup. We demonstrate high quality reconstruction of several common rotationally symmetric as well as more complex n-fold symmetric transparent objects with our approach.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kim_Acquiring_Axially-Symmetric_Transparent_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jaewon Kim, Ilya Reshetouski, Abhijeet Ghosh
Action Unit Detection With Region Adaptation, Multi-Labeling Learning and Optimal Temporal Fusing	Action Unit (AU) detection becomes essential for facial analysis. Many proposed approaches face challenging problems in dealing with the alignments of different face regions, in the effective fusion of temporal information, and in training a model for multiple AU labels. To better address these problems, we propose a deep learning framework for AU detection with region of interest (ROI) adaptation, integrated multi-label learning, and optimal LSTM-based temporal fusing. First, an ROI cropping net is designed to make sure specific interested regions of faces are learned independently; each sub-region has a local convolutional neural network (CNN) whose convolutional filters will only be trained for the corresponding region. Second, multi-label learning is employed to integrate the outputs of those individual ROI cropping nets, which learns the inter-relationships of various AUs and acquires global features across sub-regions for AU detection. Finally, the optimal selection of multiple LSTM layers are carried out to best fuse temporal features, in order to make the AU prediction the most accurate. The proposed approach is evaluated on two popular AU detection datasets, BP4D and DISFA, outperforming the state of the art significantly, with an average improvement of around 13% in BP4D and 25% in DISFA, respectively.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Li_Action_Unit_Detection_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Wei Li, Farnaz Abtahi, Zhigang Zhu
Action-Affect-Gender Classification Using Multi-Task Representation Learning	Recent work in affective computing focused on affect from facial expressions, and not as much on body. This work focuses on body affect. Affect does not occur in isolation. Humans usually couple affect with an action; for example, a person could be running and happy. Recognizing body affect in sequences requires efficient algorithms to capture both the micro movements that differentiate between happy and sad and the macro variations between different actions. We depart from traditional approaches for time-series data analytics by proposing a multi-task learning model that learns a shared representation that is well-suited for action-affect-gender classification. For this paper we choose a probabilistic model, specifically Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines, to be our building block. We propose a new model that enhances the CRBM model with a factored multi-task component that enables scaling over larger number of classes without increasing the number of parameters. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available datasets, the Body Affect dataset and the Tower Game dataset, and show superior classification performance improvement over the state-of-the-art.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w41/html/Tamrakar_Action-Affect-Gender_Classification_Using_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Timothy J.

Action-Decision Networks for Visual Tracking With Deep Reinforcement Learning	This paper proposes a novel tracker which is controlled by sequentially pursuing actions learned by deep reinforcement learning. In contrast to the existing trackers using deep networks, the proposed tracker is designed to achieve a light computation as well as satisfactory tracking accuracy in both location and scale. The deep network to control actions is pre-trained using various training sequences and fine-tuned during tracking for online adaptation to target and background changes. The pre-training is done by utilizing deep reinforcement learning as well as supervised learning. The use of reinforcement learning enables even partially labeled data to be successfully utilized for semi-supervised learning. Through evaluation of the OTB dataset, the proposed tracker is validated to achieve a competitive performance that is three times faster than state-of-the-art, deep network-based trackers. The fast version of the proposed method, which operates in real-time on GPU, outperforms the state-of-the-art real-time trackers.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yun_Action-Decision_Networks_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Sangdoo Yun, Jongwon Choi, Youngjoon Yoo, Kimin Yun, Jin Young Choi
ActionVLAD: Learning Spatio-Temporal Aggregation for Action Classification	In this work, we introduce a new video representation for action classification that aggregates local convolutional features across the entire spatio-temporal extent of the video. We do so by integrating state-of-the-art two-stream networks with learnable spatio-temporal feature aggregation. The resulting architecture is end-to-end trainable for whole-video classification. We investigate different strategies for pooling across space and time and combining signals from the different streams. We find that: (i) it is important to pool jointly across space and time, but (ii) appearance and motion streams are best aggregated into their own separate representations. Finally, we show that our representation outperforms the two-stream base architecture by a large margin (13% relative) as well as outperforms other baselines with comparable base architectures on HMDB51, UCF101, and Charades video classification benchmarks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Girdhar_ActionVLAD_Learning_Spatio-Temporal_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Rohit Girdhar, Deva Ramanan, Abhinav Gupta, Josef Sivic, Bryan Russell
Active Convolution: Learning the Shape of Convolution for Image Classification	In recent years, deep learning has achieved great success in many computer vision applications. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have lately emerged as a major approach to image classification. Most research on CNNs thus far has focused on developing architectures such as the Inception and residual networks. The convolution layer is the core of the CNN, but few studies have addressed the convolution unit itself. In this paper, we introduce a convolution unit called the active convolution unit (ACU). A new convolution has no fixed shape, because of which we can define any form of convolution. Its shape can be learned through backpropagation during training. Our proposed unit has a few advantages. First, the ACU is a generalization of convolution; it can define not only all conventional convolutions, but also convolutions with fractional pixel coordinates. We can freely change the shape of the convolution, which provides greater freedom to form CNN structures. Second, the shape of the convolution is learned while training and there is no need to tune it by hand. Third, the ACU can learn better than a conventional unit, where we obtained the improvement simply by changing the conventional convolution to an ACU. We tested our proposed method on plain and residual networks, and the results showed significant improvement using our method on various datasets and architectures in comparison with the baseline. Code is available at https://github.com/jyh2986/Active-Convolution.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Jeon_Active_Convolution_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yunho Jeon, Junmo Kim
AdaScan: Adaptive Scan Pooling in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Human Action Recognition in Videos	We propose a novel method for temporally pooling frames in a video for the task of human action recognition. The method is motivated by the observation that there are only a small number of frames which, together, contain sufficient information to discriminate an action class present in a video, from the rest. The proposed method learns to pool such discriminative and informative frames, while discarding a majority of the non-informative frames in a single temporal scan of the video. Our algorithm does so by continuously predicting the discriminative importance of each video frame and subsequently pooling them in a deep learning framework. We show the effectiveness of our proposed pooling method on standard benchmarks where it consistently improves on baseline pooling methods, with both RGB and optical flow based Convolutional networks. Further, in combination with complementary video representations, we show results that are competitive with respect to the state-of-the-art results on two challenging and publicly available benchmark datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kar_AdaScan_Adaptive_Scan_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Amlan Kar, Nishant Rai, Karan Sikka, Gaurav Sharma
Adaptive Class Preserving Representation for Image Classification	In linear representation-based image classification, an unlabeled sample is represented by the entire training set. To obtain a stable and discriminative solution, regularization on the vector of representation coefficients is necessary. For example, the representation in sparse representation-based classification (SRC) uses L1 norm penalty as regularization, which is equal to lasso. However, lasso overemphasizes the role of sparseness while ignoring the inherent structure among samples belonging to a same class. Many recent developed representation classifications have adopted lasso-type regressions to improve the performance. In this paper, we propose the adaptive class preserving representation for classification (ACPRC). Our method is related to group lasso based classification but different in two key points: When training samples in a class are uncorrelated, ACPRC turns into SRC; when samples in a class are highly correlated, it obtains similar result as group lasso. The superiority of ACPRC over other state-of-the-art regularization techniques including lasso, group lasso, sparse group lasso, etc. are evaluated by extensive experiments.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Mi_Adaptive_Class_Preserving_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jian-Xun Mi, Qiankun Fu, Weisheng Li
Adaptive Deep Metric Learning for Identity-Aware Facial Expression Recognition	A key challenge of facial expression recognition (FER) is to develop effective representations to balance the complex distribution of intra- and inter- class variations. The latest deep convolutional networks proposed for FER are trained by penalizing the misclassification of images via the softmax loss. In this paper, we show that better FER performance can be achieved by combining the deep metric loss and softmax loss in a unified two fully connected layer branches framework via joint optimization. A generalized adaptive (N+M)-tuplet clusters loss function together with the identity-aware hard-negative mining and online positive mining scheme are proposed for identity-invariant FER. It reduces the computational burden of deep metric learning, and alleviates the difficulty of threshold validation and anchor selection. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms many state-of-art approaches on the posed as well as spontaneous facial expression databases.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w6/html/Liu_Adaptive_Deep_Metric_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xiaofeng Liu, B.

Adaptive Relaxed ADMM: Convergence Theory and Practical Implementation	Many modern computer vision and machine learning applications rely on solving difficult optimization problems that involve non-differentiable objective functions and constraints. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a widely used approach to solve such problems. Relaxed ADMM is a generalization of ADMM that often achieves better performance, but its efficiency depends strongly on algorithm parameters that must be chosen by an expert user. We propose an adaptive method that automatically tunes the key algorithm parameters to achieve optimal performance without user oversight. Inspired by recent work on adaptivity, the proposed adaptive relaxed ADMM (ARADMM) is derived by assuming a Barzilai-Borwein style linear gradient. A detailed convergence analysis of ARADMM is provided, and numerical results on several applications demonstrate fast practical convergence.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xu_Adaptive_Relaxed_ADMM_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zheng Xu, Mario A.

Adaptive and Move Making Auxiliary Cuts for Binary Pairwise Energies	Many computer vision problems require optimization of binary non-submodular energies. In this context, iterative submodularization techniques based on trust region (LSA-TR) and auxiliary functions (LSA-AUX) have been recently proposed [??]. They achieve state-of-the-art-results on a number of computer vision applications. In this paper we extend the LSA-AUX framework in two directions. First, unlike LSA-AUX which selects auxiliary functions based solely on the current solution, we propose to incorporate several additional criteria. This results in tighter bounds for configurations that are more likely or closer to the current solution. Second, we propose move-making extensions of LSA-AUX which achieve tighter bounds by restricting the search space. Finally, we evaluate our methods on several applications. We show that for each application at least one of our extensions significantly outperforms the original LSA-AUX. Moreover, the best extension of LSA-AUX is comparable to or better than LSA-TR on five out of six applications, achieving state-of-the-arts results on four out of six applications.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Gorelick_Adaptive_and_Move_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Lena Gorelick, Yuri Boykov, Olga Veksler
Additive Component Analysis	Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most versatile tools for unsupervised learning with applications ranging from dimensionality reduction to exploratory data analysis and visualization. While much effort has been devoted to encouraging meaningful representations through regularization (e.g. non-negativity or sparsity), underlying linearity assumptions can limit their effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose Additive Component Analysis (ACA), a novel nonlinear extension of PCA. Inspired by multivariate nonparametric regression with additive models, ACA fits a smooth manifold to data by learning an explicit mapping from a low-dimensional latent space to the input space, which trivially enables applications like denoising. Furthermore, ACA can be used as a drop-in replacement in many algorithms that use linear component analysis methods as a subroutine via the local tangent space of the learned manifold. Unlike many other nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, ACA can be efficiently applied to large datasets since it does not require computing pairwise similarities or storing training data during testing. Multiple ACA layers can also be composed and learned jointly with essentially the same procedure for improved representational power, demonstrating the encouraging potential of nonparametric deep learning. We evaluate ACA on a variety of datasets, showing improved robustness, reconstruction performance, and interpretability.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Murdock_Additive_Component_Analysis_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Calvin Murdock, Fernando De la Torre
Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation	Adversarial learning methods are a promising approach to training robust deep networks, and can generate complex samples across diverse domains. They can also improve recognition despite the presence of domain shift or dataset bias: recent adversarial approaches to unsupervised domain adaptation reduce the difference between the training and test domain distributions and thus improve generalization performance. However, while generative adversarial networks (GANs) show compelling visualizations, they are not optimal on discriminative tasks and can be limited to smaller shifts. On the other hand, discriminative approaches can handle larger domain shifts, but impose tied weights on the model and do not exploit a GAN-based loss. In this work, we first outline a novel generalized framework for adversarial adaptation, which subsumes recent state-of-the-art approaches as special cases, and use this generalized view to better relate prior approaches. We then propose a previously unexplored instance of our general framework which combines discriminative modeling, untied weight sharing, and a GAN loss, which we call Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA). We show that ADDA is more effective yet considerably simpler than competing domain-adversarial methods, and demonstrate the promise of our approach by exceeding state-of-the-art unsupervised adaptation results on standard domain adaptation tasks as well as a difficult cross-modality object classification task.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tzeng_Adversarial_Discriminative_Domain_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Eric Tzeng, Judy Hoffman, Kate Saenko, Trevor Darrell
Adversarially Tuned Scene Generation	Generalization performance of trained computer vision (CV) systems that use computer graphics (CG) generated data is not yet effective due to the concept of 'domain-shift' between virtual and real data. Although simulated data augmented with a few real-world samples has been shown to mitigate domain shift and improve transferability of trained models, guiding or bootstrapping the virtual data generation with the distributions learnt from target real world domain is desired, especially in the fields where annotating even few real images is laborious (such as semantic labeling, optical flow, and intrinsic images etc.). In order to address this problem in an unsupervised manner, our work combines recent advances in CG, which aims at generating stochastic scene layouts using large collections of 3D object models, and generative adversarial training, which aims at training generative models by measuring discrepancy between generated and real data in terms of their separability in the space of a deep discriminatively-trained classifier. Our method uses iterative estimation of the posterior density of prior distributions for a generative graphical model. This is done within a rejection sampling framework. Initially, we assume uniform distributions as priors over parameters of a scene described by a generative graphical model. As iterations proceed the uniform prior distributions are updated sequentially to distributions that are closer to the unknown distributions of target data. We demonstrate the utility of adversarially tuned scene generation on two real world benchmark datasets (CityScapes and CamVid) for traffic scene semantic labeling with a deep convolutional net (DeepLab). We obtained performance improvements by 2.28 and 3.14 points on the IoU metric between the DeepLab models trained on simulated sets prepared from the scene generation models before and after tuning to CityScapes and CamVid respectively.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Veeravasarapu_Adversarially_Tuned_Scene_CVPR_2017_paper.html	VSR Veeravasarapu, Constantin Rothkopf, Ramesh Visvanathan
Aerial Vehicle Tracking by Adaptive Fusion of Hyperspectral Likelihood Maps	Hyperspectral cameras provide unique spectral signatures that can be used to solve surveillance tasks. This paper proposes a novel real-time hyperspectral likelihood maps-aided tracking method (HLT) inspired by an adaptive hyperspectral sensor. We focus on the target detection part of a tracking system and remove the necessity to build any offline classifiers and tune large amount of hyper-parameters, instead learning a generative target model in an online manner for hyperspectral channels ranging from visible to infrared wavelengths. The key idea is that our adaptive fusion method can combine likelihood maps from multiple bands of hyperspectral imagery into one single more distinctive representation increasing the margin between mean value of foreground and background pixels in the fused map.

The Aff-wild benchmark contains about 300 videos (over 2,000 minutes of data) annotated with regards to valence and arousal, all captured `in-the-wild' (the main source being Youtube videos). The paper presents the database description, the experimental set up, the baseline method used for the Challenge and finally the summary of the performance of the different methods submitted to the Affect-in-the-Wild Challenge for Valence and Arousal estimation. The challenge demonstrates that meticulously designed deep neural networks can achieve very good performance when trained with in-the-wild data.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w33/html/Zafeiriou_Aff-Wild_Valence_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Stefanos Zafeiriou, Dimitrios Kollias, Mihalis A.

Age Estimation Guided Convolutional Neural Network for Age-Invariant Face Recognition	While very promising results have been shown on face recognition related problems, age-invariant face recognition still remains a challenge. Facial appearance of a person changes over time, which results in significant intra-class variations. In order to address this problem, we propose a novel deep face recognition network called age estimation guided convolutional neural network (AE-CNN) to separate the variations caused by aging from the person-specific features which are stable. The carefully designed CNN model can learn age-invariant features for face recognition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use age estimation task for obtaining age-invariant features. Extensive results on two well-known public domain face aging datasets: MORPH Album 2 and CACD show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w6/html/Zheng_Age_Estimation_Guided_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tianyue Zheng, Weihong Deng, Jiani Hu
Age Progression/Regression by Conditional Adversarial Autoencoder	"""If I provide you a face image of mine (without telling you the actual age when I took the picture) and a large amount of face images that I crawled (containing labeled faces of different ages but not necessarily paired), can you show me what I would look like when I am 80 or what I was like when I was 5?"" The answer is probably a ""No."" Most existing face aging works attempt to learn the transformation between age groups and thus would require the paired samples as well as the labeled query image. In this paper, we look at the problem from a generative modeling perspective such that no paired samples is required. In addition, given an unlabeled image, the generative model can directly produce the image with desired age attribute. We propose a conditional adversarial autoencoder (CAAE) that learns a face manifold, traversing on which smooth age progression and regression can be realized simultaneously. In CAAE, the face is first mapped to a latent vector through a convolutional encoder, and then the vector is projected to the face manifold conditional on age through a deconvolutional generator. The latent vector preserves personalized face features (i.e., personality) and the age condition controls progression vs. regression. Two adversarial networks are imposed on the encoder and generator, respectively, forcing to generate more photo-realistic faces. Experimental results demonstrate the appealing performance and flexibility of the proposed framework by comparing with the state-of-the-art and ground truth."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Age_ProgressionRegression_by_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhifei Zhang, Yang Song, Hairong Qi
AgeDB: The First Manually Collected, In-The-Wild Age Database	"Over the last few years, increased interest has arisen with respect to age-related tasks in the Computer Vision community. As a result, several ""in-the-wild"" databases annotated with respect to the age attribute became available in the literature. Nevertheless, one major drawback of these databases is that they are semi-automatically collected and annotated and thus they contain noisy labels. Therefore, the algorithms that are evaluated in such databases are prone to noisy estimates. In order to overcome such drawbacks, we present in this paper the first, to the best of knowledge, manually collected ""in-the-wild"" age database, dubbed AgeDB, containing images annotated with accurate to the year, noise-free labels. As demonstrated by a series of experiments utilizing state-of-the-art algorithms, this unique property renders AgeDB suitable when performing experiments on age-invariant face verification, age estimation and face age progression ""in-the-wild""."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w33/html/Moschoglou_AgeDB_The_First_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Stylianos Moschoglou, Athanasios Papaioannou, Christos Sagonas, Jiankang Deng, Irene Kotsia, Stefanos Zafeiriou
Agent-Centric Risk Assessment: Accident Anticipation and Risky Region Localization	For survival, a living agent (e.g., human in Fig. 1(a)) must have the ability to assess risk (1) by temporally anticipating accidents before they occur (Fig. 1(b)), and (2) by spatially localizing risky regions (Fig. 1(c)) in the environment to move away from threats. In this paper, we take an agent-centric approach to study the accident anticipation and risky region localization tasks. We propose a novel soft-attention Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which explicitly models both spatial and appearance-wise non-linear interaction between the agent triggering the event and another agent or static-region involved. In order to test our proposed method, we introduce the Epic Fail (EF) dataset consisting of 3000 viral videos capturing various accidents. In the experiments, we evaluate the risk assessment accuracy both in the temporal domain (accident anticipation) and spatial domain (risky region localization) on our EF dataset and the Street Accident (SA) dataset. Our method consistently outperforms other baselines on both datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zeng_Agent-Centric_Risk_Assessment_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Kuo-Hao Zeng, Shih-Han Chou, Fu-Hsiang Chan, Juan Carlos Niebles, Min Sun
Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks	"We present a simple, highly modularized network architecture for image classification. Our network is constructed by repeating a building block that aggregates a set of transformations with the same topology. Our simple design results in a homogeneous, multi-branch architecture that has only a few hyper-parameters to set. This strategy exposes a new dimension, which we call ""cardinality"" (the size of the set of transformations), as an essential factor in addition to the dimensions of depth and width. On the ImageNet-1K dataset, we empirically show that even under the restricted condition of maintaining complexity, increasing cardinality is able to improve classification accuracy. Moreover, increasing cardinality is more effective than going deeper or wider when we increase the capacity. Our models, named ResNeXt, are the foundations of our entry to the ILSVRC 2016 classification task in which we secured 2nd place. We further investigate ResNeXt on an ImageNet-5K set and the COCO detection set, also showing better results than its ResNet counterpart. The code and models are publicly available online."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xie_Aggregated_Residual_Transformations_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Saining Xie, Ross Girshick, Piotr Dollar, Zhuowen Tu, Kaiming He
All You Need Is Beyond a Good Init: Exploring Better Solution for Training Extremely Deep Convolutional Neural Networks With Orthonormality and Modulation	Deep neural network is difficult to train and this predicament becomes worse as the depth increases. The essence of this problem exists in the magnitude of backpropagated errors that will result in gradient vanishing or exploding phenomenon. We show that a variant of regularizer which utilizes orthonormality among different filter banks can alleviate this problem. Moreover, we design a backward error modulation mechanism based on the quasi-isometry assumption between two consecutive parametric layers. Equipped with these two ingredients, we propose several novel optimization solutions that can be utilized for training a specific-structured (repetitively triple modules of Conv-BNReLU) extremely deep convolutional neural network (CNN) WITHOUT any shortcuts/ identity mappings from scratch. Experiments show that our proposed solutions can achieve distinct improvements for a 44-layer and a 110-layer plain networks on both the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Moreover, we can successfully train plain CNNs to match the performance of the residual counterparts. Besides, we propose new principles for designing network structure from the insights evoked by orthonormality. Combined with residual structure, we achieve comparative performance on the ImageNet dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xie_All_You_Need_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Di Xie, Jiang Xiong, Shiliang Pu
Alternating Direction Graph Matching	In this paper, we introduce a graph matching method that can account for constraints of arbitrary order, with arbitrary potential functions. Unlike previous decomposition approaches that rely on the graph structures, we introduce a decomposition of the matching constraints. Graph matching is then reformulated as a non-convex non-separable optimization problem that can be split into smaller and much-easier-to-solve subproblems, by means of the alternating direction method of multipliers. The proposed framework is modular, scalable, and can be instantiated into different variants. Two instantiations are studied exploring pairwise and higher-order constraints. Experimental results on widely adopted benchmarks involving synthetic and real examples demonstrate that the proposed solutions outperform existing pairwise graph matching methods, and competitive with the state of the art in higher-order settings.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Le-Huu_Alternating_Direction_Graph_CVPR_2017_paper.html	D.

Amodal Detection of 3D Objects: Inferring 3D Bounding Boxes From 2D Ones in RGB-Depth Images	This paper addresses the problem of amodal perception of 3D object detection. The task is to not only find object localizations in the 3D world, but also estimate their physical sizes and poses, even if only parts of them are visible in the RGB-D image. Recent approaches have attempted to harness point cloud from depth channel to exploit 3D features directly in the 3D space and demonstrated the superiority over traditional 2.5D representation approaches. We revisit the amodal 3D detection problem by sticking to the 2.5D representation framework, and directly relate 2.5D visual appearance to 3D objects. We propose a novel 3D object detection system that simultaneously predicts objects' 3D locations, physical sizes, and orientations in indoor scenes. Experiments on the NYUV2 dataset show our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art and indicates 2.5D representation is capable of encoding features for 3D amodal object detection.

An Algorithm for Parallel Reconstruction of Jointly Sparse Tensors With Applications to Hyperspectral Imaging	A wide range of Compressive Sensing (CS) frameworks have been proposed to address the task of color and hyperspectral image sampling and reconstruction. Methods for reconstruction of jointly sparse vectors that leverage joint sparsity constraints such as the Multiple Measurement Vector (MMV) approach have been shown to outperform Single Measurement Vector (SMV) frameworks. Recent work has shown that exploiting joint sparsity while simultaneously preserving the high-dimensional structure of the data results in further performance improvements. We introduce a parallelizable extension of a previously proposed serial tensorial MMV approach which, like its predecessor, exploits joint sparsity constraints multiple data dimensions simultaneously, but that is parallelizable in nature. We demonstrate empirically that the proposed method provides better reconstruction fidelity of hyperspectral imagery and that it is also more computationally efficient than the current state of the art.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w3/html/Li_An_Algorithm_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Qun Li, Edgar A.

An Early Experience Toward Developing Computer Aided Diagnosis for Gram-Stained Smears Images	Gram stained direct smears test is a simple and cost effective way in early identification of infections. Unfortunately, this practice is considered time consuming and labour intensive. Most existing effort in this area is to perform high-magnification analysis of images taken from manually selected areas. In this paper, we address the problem of the automated selection of candidate areas for subsequent high-magnification analysis. We explore the possibility of selecting good candidate areas based on low-magnification images where bacteria are likely to be found when viewed in high-magnification images. To this end, we develop an approach to classify the areas according to the textural information of an image patch. We explore and study the efficacy of traditional textural features such as HOG, LBP, and 2D-DCT. Experiments show that the best variant method is able to select working areas where it is likely to find bacteria in high-powered objective images in a wide-range of images.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w8/html/Carvajal_An_Early_Experience_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Johanna Carvajal, Daniel F.

An Efficient Algebraic Solution to the Perspective-Three-Point Problem	In this work, we present an algebraic solution to the classical perspective-3-point (P3P) problem for determining the position and attitude of a camera from observations of three known reference points. In contrast to previous approaches, we first directly determine the camera's attitude by employing the corresponding geometric constraints to formulate a system of trigonometric equations. This is then efficiently solved, following an algebraic approach, to determine the unknown rotation matrix and subsequently the camera's position. As compared to recent alternatives, our method avoids computing unnecessary (and potentially numerically unstable) intermediate results, and thus achieves higher numerical accuracy and robustness at a lower computational cost. These benefits are validated through extensive Monte-Carlo simulations for both nominal and close-to-singular geometric configurations.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ke_An_Efficient_Algebraic_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tong Ke, Stergios I.

An Efficient Background Term for 3D Reconstruction and Tracking With Smooth Surface Models	We present a novel strategy to shrink and constrain a 3D model, represented as a smooth spline-like surface, within the visual hull of an object observed from one or multiple views. This new 'background' or 'silhouette' term combines the efficiency of previous approaches based on an image-plane distance transform with the accuracy of formulations based on raycasting or ray potentials. The overall formulation is solved by alternating an inner nonlinear minization (raycasting) with a joint optimization of the surface geometry, the camera poses and the data correspondences. Experiments on 3D reconstruction and object tracking show that the new formulation corrects several deficiencies of existing approaches, for instance when modelling non-convex shapes. Moreover, our proposal is more robust against defects in the object segmentation and inherently handles the presence of uncertainty in the measurements (e.g. null depth values in images provided by RGB-D cameras).	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Jaimez_An_Efficient_Background_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mariano Jaimez, Thomas J.

An Empirical Evaluation of Visual Question Answering for Novel Objects	We study the problem of answering questions about images in the harder setting, where the test questions and corresponding images contain novel objects, which were not queried about in the training data. Such setting is inevitable in real world--owing to the heavy tailed distribution of the visual categories, there would be some objects which would not be annotated in the train set. We show that the performance of two popular existing methods drop significantly (21-28%) when evaluated on novel objects cf. known objects. We propose methods which use large existing external corpora of (i) unlabeled text, i.e. books, and (ii) images tagged with classes, to achieve novel object based visual question answering. We systematically study both, an oracle case where the novel objects are known textually, as well as a fully automatic case without any explicit knowledge of the novel objects, but with the minimal assumption that the novel objects are semantically related to the existing objects in training. The proposed methods for novel object based visual question answering are modular and can potentially be used with many visual question answering architectures. We show consistent improvements with the two popular architectures and give qualitative analysis of the cases where the model does well and of those where it fails to bring improvements.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ramakrishnan_An_Empirical_Evaluation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Santhosh K.

An Exact Penalty Method for Locally Convergent Maximum Consensus	Maximum consensus estimation plays a critically important role in computer vision. Currently, the most prevalent approach draws from the class of non-deterministic hypothesize-and-verify algorithms, which are cheap but do not guarantee solution quality. On the other extreme, there are global algorithms which are exhaustive search in nature and can be costly for practical-sized inputs. This paper aims to fill the gap between the two extremes by proposing a locally convergent maximum consensus algorithm. Our method is based on a formulating the problem with linear complementarity constraints, then defining a penalized version which is provably equivalent to the original problem. Based on the penalty problem, we develop a Frank-Wolfe algorithm that can deterministically solve the maximum consensus problem. Compared to the randomized techniques, our method is deterministic and locally convergent; relative to the global algorithms, our method is much more practical on realistic input sizes. Further, our approach is naturally applicable to problems with geometric residuals.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Le_An_Exact_Penalty_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Huu Le, Tat-Jun Chin, David Suter
Analysis, Comparison, and Assessment of Latent Fingerprint Image Preprocessing	Latent fingerprints obtained from crime scenes are rarely immediately suitable for identification purposes. Instead, most latent fingerprint images must be preprocessed to enhance the fingerprint information held within the digital image, while suppressing interference arising from noise and otherwise unwanted image features. In the following we present results of our ongoing research to assess this critical step in the forensic workflow. Previously we discussed the creation of a new database of latent fingerprint images to support such research. The new contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we implement a study in which a group of trained Latent Print Examiners provide Extended Feature Set markups of all images. We discuss the experimental design of this study, and its execution. Next, we propose metrics for measuring the increase of fingerprint information provided by latent fingerprint image preprocessing, and we present preliminary analysis of these metrics when applied to the images in our database. We consider formally defined quality scales (Good, Bad, Ugly), and minutiae identifications of latent fingerprint images before and after preprocessing. All analyses show that latent fingerprint image preprocessing results in a statistically significant increase in fingerprint information and quality.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w6/html/Guan_Analysis_Comparison_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Haiying Guan, Paul Lee, Andrew Dienstfrey, Mary Theofanos, Curtis Lamp, Brian Stanton, Matthew T.

Analyzing Computer Vision Data - The Good, the Bad and the Ugly	In recent years, a great number of datasets were published to train and evaluate computer vision (CV) algorithms. These valuable contributions helped to push CV solutions to a level where they can be used for safety-relevant applications, such as autonomous driving. However, major questions concerning quality and usefulness of test data for CV evaluation are still unanswered. Researchers and engineers try to cover all test cases by using as much test data as possible. In this paper, we propose a different solution for this challenge. We introduce a method for dataset analysis which builds upon an improved version of the CV-HAZOP checklist, a list of potential hazards within the CV domain. Picking stereo vision as an example, we provide an extensive survey of 28 datasets covering the last two decades. We create a tailored checklist and apply it to the datasets Middlebury, KITTI, Sintel, Freiburg, and HCI to present a thorough characterization and quantitative comparison. We confirm the usability of our checklist for identification of challenging stereo situations by applying nine state-of-the-art stereo matching algorithms on the analyzed datasets, showing that hazard frames correlate with difficult frames. We show that challenging datasets still allow a meaningful algorithm evaluation even for small subsets. Finally, we provide a list of missing test cases that are still not covered by current datasets as inspiration for researchers who want to participate in future dataset creation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zendel_Analyzing_Computer_Vision_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Oliver Zendel, Katrin Honauer, Markus Murschitz, Martin Humenberger, Gustavo Fernandez Dominguez
AnchorNet: A Weakly Supervised Network to Learn Geometry-Sensitive Features for Semantic Matching	Despite significant progress of deep learning in recent years, state-of-the-art semantic matching methods still rely on legacy features such as SIFT or HoG. We argue that the strong invariance properties that are key to the success of recent deep architectures on the classification task make them unfit for dense correspondence tasks, unless a large amount of supervision is used. In this work, we propose a deep network, termed AnchorNet, that produces image representations that are well-suited for semantic matching. It relies on a set of filters whose response is geometrically consistent across different object instances, even in the presence of strong intra-class, scale, or viewpoint variations. Trained only with weak image-level labels, the final representation successfully captures information about the object structure and improves results of state-of-the-art semantic matching methods such as the Deformable Spatial Pyramid or the Proposal Flow methods. We show positive results on the cross-instance matching task where different instances of the same object category are matched as well as on a new cross-category semantic matching task aligning pairs of instances each from a different object class.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Novotny_AnchorNet_A_Weakly_CVPR_2017_paper.html	David Novotny, Diane Larlus, Andrea Vedaldi
Annotating Object Instances With a Polygon-RNN	In this paper, we propose an approach for semi-automatic annotation of object instances. While most current methods treat object segmentation as a pixel-labeling problem, we here cast it as a polygon prediction task, mimicking how most current datasets have been annotated. In particular, our approach takes as input an image crop and produces a vertex of the polygon, one at a time, allowing the human annotator to interfere at any time and correct the point. Our model easily integrates any correction, producing as accurate segmentations as desired by the annotator. We show that our annotation method speeds up the annotation process by factor of 4.7 across all classes, while achieving 78.4% agreement in IoU with original ground-truth, matching the typical agreement between human annotators. For cars, our speed-up factor is even higher, at 7.3 for agreement of 82.2%. We further show generalization capabilities of our approach on unseen datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Castrejon_Annotating_Object_Instances_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Lluis Castrejon, Kaustav Kundu, Raquel Urtasun, Sanja Fidler
Anti-Glare: Tightly Constrained Optimization for Eyeglass Reflection Removal	Absence of a clear eye visibility not only degrades the aesthetic value of an entire face image but also creates difficulties in many computer vision tasks. Even mild reflections produce the undesired superpositions of visual information, whose decomposition into the background and reflection layers using a single image is a highly ill-posed problem. In this work, we enforce the tight constraints derived by thoroughly analysing the properties of an eyeglass reflection. In addition, our strategy regularizes gradients of the reflection layer to be highly sparse and proposes the facial symmetry prior via formulating a non-convex optimization scheme, which removes the reflections within a few iterations. Experiments on frontal face image inputs demonstrate the high quality reflection removal results and improvement of the iris detection rate.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Sandhan_Anti-Glare_Tightly_Constrained_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tushar Sandhan, Jin Young Choi
Application of Computer Vision and Vector Space Model for Tactical Movement Classification in Badminton	Performance profiling in sports allow evaluating opponents' tactics and the development of counter tactics to gain a competitive advantage. The work presented develops a comprehensive methodology to automate tactical profiling in elite badminton. The proposed approach uses computer vision techniques to automate data gathering from video footage. The image processing algorithm is validated using video footage of the highest level tournaments, including the Olympic Games. The average accuracy of player position detection is 96.03% and 97.09% on the two halves of a badminton court. Next, frequent trajectories of badminton players are extracted and classified according to their tactical relevance. The classification performs at 97.79% accuracy, 97.81% precision, 97.44% recall, and 97.62% F-score. The combination of automated player position detection, frequent trajectory extraction, and the subsequent classification can be used to automatically generate player tactical profiles.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w2/html/Weeratunga_Application_of_Computer_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Kokum Weeratunga, Anuja Dharmaratne, Khoo Boon How
Applying Faster R-CNN for Object Detection on Malaria Images	Deep learning based models have had great success in object detection, but the state of the art models have not yet been widely applied to biological image data. We apply for the first time an object detection model previously used on natural images to identify cells and recognize their stages in brightfield microscopy images of malaria-infected blood. Many micro-organisms like malaria parasites are still studied by expert manual inspection and hand counting. This type of object detection task is challenging due to factors like variations in cell shape, density, and color, and uncertainty of some cell classes. In addition, annotated data useful for training is scarce, and the class distribution is inherently highly imbalanced due to the dominance of uninfected red blood cells. We use Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), one of the top performing object detection models in recent years, pre-trained on ImageNet but fine tuned with our data.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w8/html/Hung_Applying_Faster_R-CNN_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jane Hung, Anne Carpenter
Are Large-Scale 3D Models Really Necessary for Accurate Visual Localization?	Accurate visual localization is a key technology for autonomous navigation. 3D structure-based methods employ 3D models of the scene to estimate the full 6DOF pose of a camera very accurately. However, constructing (and extending) large-scale 3D models is still a significant challenge. In contrast, 2D image retrieval-based methods only require a database of geo-tagged images, which is trivial to construct and to maintain. They are often considered inaccurate since they only approximate the positions of the cameras. Yet, the exact camera pose can theoretically be recovered when enough relevant database images are retrieved. In this paper, we demonstrate experimentally that large-scale 3D models are not strictly necessary for accurate visual localization. We create reference poses for a large and challenging urban dataset. Using these poses, we show that combining image-based methods with local reconstructions results in a pose accuracy similar to the state-of-the-art structure-based methods. Our results suggest that we might want to reconsider the current approach for accurate large-scale localization.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Sattler_Are_Large-Scale_3D_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Torsten Sattler, Akihiko Torii, Josef Sivic, Marc Pollefeys, Hajime Taira, Masatoshi Okutomi, Tomas Pajdla
Are You Smarter Than a Sixth Grader? Textbook Question Answering for Multimodal Machine Comprehension	We introduce the task of Multi-Modal Machine Comprehension (M3C), which aims at answering multimodal questions given a context of text, diagrams and images. We present the Textbook Question Answering (TQA) dataset that includes 1,076 lessons and 26,260 multi-modal questions, taken from middle school science curricula. Our analysis shows that a significant portion of questions require complex parsing of the text and the diagrams and reasoning, indicating that our dataset is more complex compared to previous machine comprehension and visual question answering datasets. We extend state-of-the-art methods for textual machine comprehension and visual question answering to the TQA dataset. Our experiments show that these models do not perform well on TQA. The presented dataset opens new challenges for research in question answering and reasoning across multiple modalities.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kembhavi_Are_You_Smarter_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Aniruddha Kembhavi, Minjoon Seo, Dustin Schwenk, Jonghyun Choi, Ali Farhadi, Hannaneh Hajishirzi
ArtTrack: Articulated Multi-Person Tracking in the Wild	"In this paper we propose an approach for articulated tracking of multiple people in unconstrained videos. Our starting point is a model that resembles existing architectures for single-frame pose estimation but is substantially faster. We achieve this in two ways: (1) by simplifying and sparsifying the body-part relationship graph and leveraging recent methods for faster inference, and (2) by offloading a substantial share of computation onto a feed-forward convolutional architecture that is able to detect and associate body joints of the same person even in clutter. We use this model to generate proposals for body joint locations and formulate articulated tracking as spatio-temporal grouping of such proposals. This allows to jointly solve the association problem for all people in the scene by propagating evidence from strong detections through time and enforcing constraints that each proposal can be assigned to one person only. We report results on a public ""MPII Human Pose"" benchmark and on a new ""MPII Video Pose"" dataset of image sequences with multiple people. We demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results while using only a fraction of time and is able to leverage temporal information to improve state-of-the-art for crowded scenes."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Insafutdinov_ArtTrack_Articulated_Multi-Person_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Eldar Insafutdinov, Mykhaylo Andriluka, Leonid Pishchulin, Siyu Tang, Evgeny Levinkov, Bjoern Andres, Bernt Schiele
Assisting Users in a World Full of Cameras: A Privacy-Aware Infrastructure for Computer Vision Applications	Computer vision based technologies have seen widespread adoption over the recent years. This use is not limited to the rapid adoption of facial recognition technology but extends to facial expression recognition, scene recognition and more. These developments raise privacy concerns and call for novel solutions to ensure adequate user awareness, and ideally, control over the resulting collection and use of potentially sensitive data. While cameras have become ubiquitous, most of the time users are not even aware of their presence. In this paper we introduce a novel distributed privacy infrastructure for the Internet-of-Things and discuss in particular how it can help enhance user's awareness of and control over the collection and use of video data about them. The infrastructure, which has undergone early deployment and evaluation on two campuses, supports the automated discovery of IoT resources and the selective notification of users. This includes the presence of computer vision applications that collect data about users. In particular, we describe an implementation of functionality that helps users discover nearby cameras and choose whether or not they want their faces to be denatured in the video streams.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w16/html/Satyanarayanan_Assisting_Users_in_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Anupam Das; Martin Degeling; Xiaoyou Wang; Junjue Wang; Norman Sadeh; Mahadev Satyanarayanan
Asymmetric Feature Maps With Application to Sketch Based Retrieval	We propose a novel concept of asymmetric feature maps (AFM), which allows to evaluate multiple kernels between a query and database entries without increasing the memory requirements. To demonstrate the advantages of the AFM method, we derive a short vector image representation that, due to asymmetric feature maps, supports efficient scale and translation invariant sketch-based image retrieval. Unlike most of the short-code based retrieval systems, the proposed method provides the query localization in the retrieved image. The efficiency of the search is boosted by approximating a 2D translation search via trigonometric polynomial of scores by 1D projections. The projections are a special case of AFM. An order of magnitude speed-up is achieved compared to traditional trigonometric polynomials. The results are boosted by an image-based average query expansion, exceeding significantly the state of the art on standard benchmarks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tolias_Asymmetric_Feature_Maps_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Giorgos Tolias, Ondrej Chum
Asynchronous Temporal Fields for Action Recognition	Actions are more than just movements and trajectories: we cook to eat and we hold a cup to drink from it. A thorough understanding of videos requires going beyond appearance modeling and necessitates reasoning about the sequence of activities, as well as the higher-level constructs such as intentions. But how do we model and reason about these? We propose a fully-connected temporal CRF model for reasoning over various aspects of activities that includes objects, actions, and intentions, where the potentials are predicted by a deep network. End-to-end training of such structured models is a challenging endeavor: For inference and learning we need to construct mini-batches consisting of whole videos, leading to mini-batches with only a few videos. This causes high-correlation between data points leading to breakdown of the backprop algorithm. To address this challenge, we present an asynchronous variational inference method that allows efficient end-to-end training. Our method achieves a classification mAP of 22.4% on the Charades benchmark, outperforming the state-of-the-art (17.2% mAP), and offers equal gains on the task of temporal localization.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Sigurdsson_Asynchronous_Temporal_Fields_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Gunnar A.

Athlete Pose Estimation by a Global-Local Network	Analyzing joint movements of an athlete helps to improve the pose of the athlete. In this paper, we propose a network that combines global and local information for HPE using a 2D image. Unlike previous works that have used global or local information separately, we use the combined information to enhance the performance of HPE. General information from a global network is used as an input to a local network to refine the location of a part using a variety of regions. The global network is based on ResNet-101 [4] and trained to regress a heatmap representing parts' locations. The output features from the global network are used as input features for the local network. The local network learns spatial information using position sensitive score maps [8]. Through the end-to-end learning, the global network is affected by the local information. We demonstrate that the proposed HPE method is efficient on the LSP and UCF sports datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w2/html/Hwang_Athlete_Pose_Estimation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jihye Hwang, Sungheon Park, Nojun Kwak
Attend in Groups: A Weakly-Supervised Deep Learning Framework for Learning From Web Data	Large-scale datasets have driven the rapid development of deep neural networks for visual recognition. However, annotating a massive dataset is expensive and time-consuming. Web images and their labels are, in comparison, much easier to obtain, but direct training on such automatially harvested images can lead to unsatisfactory performance, because the noisy labels of Web images adversely affect the learned recognition models. To address this drawback we propose an end-to-end weakly-supervised deep learning framework which is robust to the label noise in Web images. The proposed framework relies on two unified strategies -- random grouping and attention -- to effectively reduce the negative impact of noisy web image annotations. Specifically, random grouping stacks multiple images into a single training instance and thus increases the labeling accuracy at the instance level. Attention, on the other hand, suppresses the noisy signals from both incorrectly labeled images and less discriminative image regions. By conducting intensive experiments on two challenging datasets, including a newly collected fine-grained dataset with Web images of different car models, the superior performance of the proposed methods over competitive baselines is clearly demonstrated.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhuang_Attend_in_Groups_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Bohan Zhuang, Lingqiao Liu, Yao Li, Chunhua Shen, Ian Reid
Attend to You: Personalized Image Captioning With Context Sequence Memory Networks	We address personalization issues of image captioning, which have not been discussed yet in previous research. For a query image, we aim to generate a descriptive sentence, accounting for prior knowledge such as the user's active vocabularies in previous documents. As applications of personalized image captioning, we tackle two post automation tasks: hashtag prediction and post generation, on our newly collected Instagram dataset, consisting of 1.1M posts from 6.3K users. We propose a novel captioning model named Context Sequence Memory Network (CSMN). Its unique updates over previous memory network models include (i) exploiting memory as a repository for multiple types of context information, (ii) appending previously generated words into memory to capture long-term information without suffering from the vanishing gradient problem, and (iii) adopting CNN memory structure to jointly represent nearby ordered memory slots for better context understanding. With quantitative evaluation and user studies via Amazon Mechanical Turk, we show the effectiveness of the three novel features of CSMN and its performance enhancement for personalized image captioning over state-of-the-art captioning models.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Park_Attend_to_You_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Cesc Chunseong Park, Byeongchang Kim, Gunhee Kim
Attention-Aware Face Hallucination via Deep Reinforcement Learning	Face hallucination is a domain-specific super-resolution problem with the goal to generate high-resolution (HR) faces from low-resolution (LR) input images. In contrast to existing methods that often learn a single patch-to-patch mapping from LR to HR images and are regardless of the contextual interdependency between patches, we propose a novel Attention-aware Face Hallucination (Attention-FH) framework which resorts to deep reinforcement learning for sequentially discovering attended patches and then performing the facial part enhancement by fully exploiting the global interdependency of the image. Specifically, in each time step, the recurrent policy network is proposed to dynamically specify a new attended region by incorporating what happened in the past. The state (i.e., face hallucination result for the whole image) can thus be exploited and updated by the local enhancement network on the selected region. The Attention-FH approach jointly learns the recurrent policy network and local enhancement network through maximizing the long-term reward that reflects the hallucination performance over the whole image. Therefore, our proposed Attention-FH is capable of adaptively personalizing an optimal searching path for each face image according to its own characteristic. Extensive experiments show our approach significantly surpasses the state-of-the-arts on in-the-wild faces with large pose and illumination variations.The state (i.e., face hallucination result for the whole image) can thus be exploited and updated by the local enhancement network on the selected region.

Attention-Based Natural Language Person Retrieval	Following the recent progress in image classification and captioning using deep learning, we develop a novel natural language person retrieval system based on an attention mechanism. More specifically, given the description of a person, the goal is to localize the person in an image. To this end, we first construct a benchmark dataset for natural language person retrieval. To do so, we generate bounding boxes for persons in a public image dataset from the segmentation masks, which are then annotated with descriptions and attributes using the Amazon Mechanical Turk. We then adopt a region proposal network in Faster R-CNN as a candidate region generator. The cropped images based on the region proposals as well as the whole images with attention weights are fed into Convolutional Neural Networks for visual feature extraction while the natural language expression and attributes are input to Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) models for text feature extraction. The visual and text features are integrated to score region proposals, and the one with the highest score is retrieved as the output of our system. The experimental results show significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods for generic object retrieval. This line of research promises to benefit search in surveillance video footage, and it may also be extended to other domains, such as human-robot interaction.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w1/html/Zhou_Attention-Based_Natural_Language_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tao Zhou, Muhao Chen, Jie Yu, Demetri Terzopoulos
Attentional Correlation Filter Network for Adaptive Visual Tracking	We propose a new tracking framework with an attentional mechanism that chooses a subset of the associated correlation filters for increased robustness and computational efficiency. The subset of filters is adaptively selected by a deep attentional network according to the dynamic properties of the tracking target. Our contributions are manifold, and are summarised as follows: (i) Introducing the Attentional Correlation Filter Network which allows adaptive tracking of dynamic targets. (ii) Utilising an attentional network which shifts the attention to the best candidate modules, as well as predicting the estimated accuracy of currently inactive modules. (iii) Enlarging the variety of correlation filters which cover target drift, blurriness, occlusion, scale changes, and flexible aspect ratio. (iv) Validating the robustness and efficiency of the attentional mechanism for visual tracking through a number of experiments. Our method achieves similar performance to non real-time trackers, and state-of-the-art performance amongst real-time trackers.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Choi_Attentional_Correlation_Filter_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jongwon Choi, Hyung Jin Chang, Sangdoo Yun, Tobias Fischer, Yiannis Demiris, Jin Young Choi
Attentional Push: A Deep Convolutional Network for Augmenting Image Salience With Shared Attention Modeling in Social Scenes	We present a novel visual attention tracking technique based on Shared Attention modeling. By considering the viewer as a participant in the activity occurring in the scene, our model learns the loci of attention of the scene actors and use it to augment image salience. We go beyond image salience and instead of only computing the power of image regions to pull attention, we also consider the strength with which the scene actors push attention to the region in question, thus the term Attentional Push. We present a convolutional neural network (CNN) which augments standard saliency models with Attentional Push. Our model contains two pathways: an Attentional Push pathway which learns the gaze location of the scene actors and a saliency pathway. These are followed by a shallow augmented saliency CNN which combines them and generates the augmented saliency. For training, we use transfer learning to initialize and train the Attentional Push CNN by minimizing the classification error of following the actors' gaze location on a 2-D grid using a large-scale gaze-following dataset. The Attentional Push CNN is then fine-tuned along with the augmented saliency CNN to minimize the Euclidean distance between the augmented saliency and ground truth fixations using an eye-tracking dataset, annotated with the head and the gaze location of the scene actors. We evaluate our model on three challenging eye fixation datasets, SALICON, iSUN and CAT2000, and illustrate significant improvements in predicting viewers' fixations in social scenes.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Gorji_Attentional_Push_A_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Siavash Gorji, James J.

Auto-Curation and Personalization of Sports Highlights Through Multimodal Excitement Measures	The production of sports highlights packages is an essential task for broadcast media, yet it requires labor-intensive video editing. We propose a novel approach for auto-curation of sports highlights, and use it to create a real-world system for editorial aid of golf highlight reels. Our method fuses information from the player reaction (action recognition such as high-five), spectators (crowd cheering), and commentator (voice tone and word analysis) to determine the most interesting moments of a game. We identify the start and end of key shot highlights with metadata such as player name and hole number, allowing personalized content summarization and retrieval. We also introduce a zero-shot learning framework for our classifiers by exploiting the correlation of different modalities. We demonstrated our system on a major golf tournament.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w2/html/Merler_Auto-Curation_and_Personalization_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Michele Merler, Dhiraj Joshi, Quoc-Bao Nguyen, Stephen Hammer, John Kent, John R.

Automated Layout Synthesis and Visualization From Images of Interior or Exterior Spaces	Recent work in virtual worlds has explored the synthesis of indoor spaces, with furniture, accessories, and other layout items. In this work, we bridge the gap between the real and virtual worlds---given an input image of an interior or exterior space, and a general user specification of the desired furnishings and layout constraints, our method furnishes the scene with a realistic arrangement and displays it to the user by augmenting the original image. It can deal with varying layouts and target arrangements at interactive rates, which affords the user a sense of collaboration with the design program, enabling the rapid visual assessment of various layout designs, a process which would typically be time consuming if done manually. Our method is suitable for phones and other mobile devices that have a camera.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w1/html/Weiss_Automated_Layout_Synthesis_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tomer Weiss, Masaki Nakada, Demetri Terzopoulos

Automated Screening of Job Candidate Based on Multimodal Video Processing	The selection of adequate job candidates is very long and challenging process for each employer. The system presented in this paper is aiming to decrease the time for candidate selection on the pre-employment stage using automatic personality screening based on visual, audio and lexical cues from short video-clips. The system is build to predict candidate scores of 5 Big Personality Traits and to estimate a final decision, to which degree the person from video-clip has to be invited to the job interview. For each channel a set of relevant features is extracted, which are used to train separately from each other using Deep Learning. In the final stage all three results are fused together into final scores prediction.

Automatic 3D Reconstruction From Multi-Date Satellite Images	We propose an algorithm for computing a 3D model from several satellite images of the same site. The method works even if the images were taken at different dates with important lighting and vegetation differences. We show that with a large number of input images the resulting 3D models can be as accurate as those obtained from a single same-date stereo pair. To deal with seasonal vegetation changes, we propose a strategy that accounts for the multi-modal nature of 3D models computed from multi-date images. Our method uses a local affine camera approximation and thus focuses on the 3D reconstruction of small areas. This is a common setup in urgent cartography for emergency management, for which abundant multi-date imagery can be immediately available to build a reference 3D model. A preliminary implementation of this method was used to win the IARPA Multi-View Stereo 3D Mapping Challenge 2016. Experiments on the challenge dataset are used to substantiate our claims.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w18/html/Facciolo_Automatic_3D_Reconstruction_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Gabriele Facciolo, Carlo de Franchis, Enric Meinhardt-Llopis
Automatic Discovery, Association Estimation and Learning of Semantic Attributes for a Thousand Categories	Attribute-based recognition models, due to their impressive performance and their ability to generalize well on novel categories, have been widely adopted for many computer vision applications. However, usually both the attribute vocabulary and the class-attribute associations have to be provided manually by domain experts or large number of annotators. This is very costly and not necessarily optimal regarding recognition performance, and most importantly, it limits the applicability of attribute-based models to large scale data sets. To tackle this problem, we propose an end-to-end unsupervised attribute learning approach. We utilize online text corpora to automatically discover a salient and discriminative vocabulary that correlates well with the human concept of semantic attributes. Moreover, we propose a deep convolutional model to optimize class-attribute associations with a linguistic prior that accounts for noise and missing data in text. In a thorough evaluation on ImageNet, we demonstrate that our model is able to efficiently discover and learn semantic attributes at a large scale. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art in zero-shot learning on three data sets: ImageNet, Animals with Attributes and aPascal/aYahoo. Finally, we enable attribute-based learning on ImageNet and will share the attributes and associations for future research.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Al-Halah_Automatic_Discovery_Association_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ziad Al-Halah, Rainer Stiefelhagen
Automatic Tactical Adjustment in Real-Time: Modeling Adversary Formations With Radon-Cumulative Distribution Transform and Canonical Correlation Analysis	"In this paper we introduce two fundamentally different techniques for optimizing counter formations in team sports. In the first technique, we use canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to learn an ""explicit"" relationship between offensive and defensive formations. We then use the learned CCA components to make predictions about players' spatial position. Experimenting with the basketball dataset (NBA season 2012-2013) we are able to predict players' positions with high precision. In the second technique, we create an image-based representation of the player movements relative to the ball. The mentioned representation enables coaches to assess team formations in a glance. The recently developed Radon Cumulative Distribution Transform (RCDT) was used alongside CCA to analyze the image-based representations. With these techniques, we provide real-time feedback to optimize both players' positions and team formations."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w2/html/Rahimi_Automatic_Tactical_Adjustment_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Amir M.

Automatic Understanding of Image and Video Advertisements	"There is more to images than their objective physical content: for example, advertisements are created to persuade a viewer to take a certain action. We propose the novel problem of automatic advertisement understanding. To enable research on this problem, we create two datasets: an image dataset of 64,832 image ads, and a video dataset of 3,477 ads. Our data contains rich annotations encompassing the topic and sentiment of the ads, questions and answers describing what actions the viewer is prompted to take and the reasoning that the ad presents to persuade the viewer (""What should I do according to this ad, and why should I do it?""), and symbolic references ads make (e.g. a dove symbolizes peace). We also analyze the most common persuasive strategies ads use, and the capabilities that computer vision systems should have to understand these strategies. We present baseline classification results for several prediction tasks, including automatically answering questions about the messages of the ads."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Hussain_Automatic_Understanding_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zaeem Hussain, Mingda Zhang, Xiaozhong Zhang, Keren Ye, Christopher Thomas, Zuha Agha, Nathan Ong, Adriana Kovashka
Awesome Typography: Statistics-Based Text Effects Transfer	In this work, we explore the problem of generating fantastic special-effects for the typography. It is quite challenging due to the model diversities to illustrate varied text effects for different characters. To address this issue, our key idea is to exploit the analytics on the high regularity of the spatial distribution for text effects to guide the synthesis process. Specifically, we characterize the stylized patches by their normalized positions and the optimal scales to depict their style elements. Our method first estimates these two features and derives their correlation statistically. They are then converted into soft constraints for texture transfer to accomplish adaptive multi-scale texture synthesis and to make style element distribution uniform. It allows our algorithm to produce artistic typography that fits for both local texture patterns and the global spatial distribution in the example. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method for various text effects over conventional style transfer methods. In addition, we validate the effectiveness of our algorithm with extensive artistic typography library generation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yang_Awesome_Typography_Statistics-Based_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shuai Yang, Jiaying Liu, Zhouhui Lian, Zongming Guo
BIND: Binary Integrated Net Descriptors for Texture-Less Object Recognition	This paper presents BIND (Binary Integrated Net Descriptor), a texture-less object detector that encodes multi-layered binary-represented nets for high precision edge-based description. Our proposed concept aligns layers of object-sized patches (nets) onto highly fragmented occlusion resistant line-segment midpoints (linelets) to encode regional information into efficient binary strings. These lightweight nets encourage discriminative object description through their high-spatial resolution, enabling highly precise encoding of the object's edges and internal texture-less information. BIND achieved various invariant properties such as rotation, scale and edge-polarity through its unique binary logical-operated encoding and matching techniques, while performing remarkably well in occlusion and clutter. Apart from yielding efficient computational performance, BIND also attained remarkable recognition rates surpassing recent state-of-the-art texture-less object detectors such as BORDER, BOLD and LINE2D.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chan_BIND_Binary_Integrated_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jacob Chan, Jimmy Addison Lee, Qian Kemao
BRISKS: Binary Features for Spherical Images on a Geodesic Grid	In this paper, we develop an interest point detector and binary feature descriptor for spherical images. We take as inspiration a recent framework developed for planar images, BRISK (Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Keypoints), and adapt the method to operate on spherical images. All of our processing is intrinsic to the sphere and avoids the distortion inherent in storing and indexing spherical images in a 2D representation. We discretise images on a spherical geodesic grid formed by recursive subdivision of a triangular mesh. This leads to a multiscale pixel grid comprising mainly hexagonal pixels that lends itself naturally to a spherical image pyramid representation. For interest point detection, we use a variant of the Accelerated Segment Test (AST) corner detector which operates on our geodesic grid. We estimate a continuous scale and location for features and descriptors are built by sampling onto a regular pattern in the tangent space. We evaluate repeatability, precision and recall on both synthetic spherical images with known ground truth correspondences and real images.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Guan_BRISKS_Binary_Features_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hao Guan, William A.

Balanced Two-Stage Residual Networks for Image Super-Resolution	In this paper, balanced two-stage residual networks (BTSRN) are proposed for single image super-resolution. The deep residual design with constrained depth achieves the optimal balance between the accuracy and the speed for super-resolving images. The experiments show that the balanced two-stage structure, together with our lightweight two-layer PConv residual block design, achieves very promising results when considering both accuracy and speed. We evaluated our models on the New Trends in Image Restoration and Enhancement workshop and challenge on image super-resolution (NTIRE SR 2017). Our final model with only 10 residual blocks ranked among the best ones in terms of not only accuracy (6th among 20 final teams) but also speed (2nd among top 6 teams in terms of accuracy).

Ball 3D Trajectory Reconstruction Without Preliminary Temporal and Geometrical Camera Calibration	This paper proposes a method for reconstructing 3D ball trajectories by using multiple temporally and geometrically uncalibrated cameras. To use cameras to measure the trajectory of a fast-moving object, such as a ball thrown by a pitcher, the cameras must be temporally synchronized and their position and orientation should be calibrated. In some cases, these conditions cannot be met, e.g., one cannot geometrically calibrate cameras when one cannot step into a baseball stadium. The basic idea of the proposed method is to use a ball captured by multiple cameras as a corresponding point. The method first detects a ball. Then, it estimates temporal difference between cameras. After that, the ball positions are used as corresponding points for geometrically calibrating the cameras. Experiments using actual pitching videos verify the effectiveness of our method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w2/html/Miyata_Ball_3D_Trajectory_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shogo Miyata, Hideo Saito, Kosuke Takahashi, Dan Mikami, Mariko Isogawa, Hideaki Kimata
Bayesian Supervised Hashing	Among learning based hashing methods, supervised hashing seeks compact binary representation of the training data to preserve semantic similarities. Recent years have witnessed various problem formulations and optimization methods for supervised hashing. Most of them optimize a form of loss function with a regulization term, which can be viewed as a maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation of the hashing codes. However, these approaches are prone to overfitting unless hyperparameters are tuned carefully. To address this problem, we present a novel fully Bayesian treatment for supervised hashing problem, named Bayesian Supervised Hashing (BSH), in which hyperparameters are automatically tuned during optimization. Additionally, by utilizing automatic relevance determination (ARD), we can figure out relative discriminating ability of different hashing bits and select most informative bits among them. Experimental results on three real-world image datasets with semantic information show that BSH can achieve superior performance over state-of-the-art methods with comparable training time.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Hu_Bayesian_Supervised_Hashing_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zihao Hu, Junxuan Chen, Hongtao Lu, Tongzhen Zhang
Benchmarking Denoising Algorithms With Real Photographs	Lacking realistic ground truth data, image denoising techniques are traditionally evaluated on images corrupted by synthesized i.i.d. Gaussian noise. We aim to obviate this unrealistic setting by developing a methodology for benchmarking denoising techniques on real photographs. We capture pairs of images with different ISO values and appropriately adjusted exposure times, where the nearly noise-free low-ISO image serves as reference. To derive the ground truth, careful post-processing is needed. We correct spatial misalignment, cope with inaccuracies in the exposure parameters through a linear intensity transform based on a novel heteroscedastic Tobit regression model, and remove residual low-frequency bias that stems, e.g., from minor illumination changes. We then capture a novel benchmark dataset, the Darmstadt Noise Dataset (DND), with consumer cameras of differing sensor sizes. One interesting finding is that various recent techniques that perform well on synthetic noise are clearly outperformed by BM3D on photographs with real noise. Our benchmark delineates realistic evaluation scenarios that deviate strongly from those commonly used in the scientific literature.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Plotz_Benchmarking_Denoising_Algorithms_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tobias Plotz, Stefan Roth
Beyond Deep Residual Learning for Image Restoration: Persistent Homology-Guided Manifold Simplification	The latest deep learning approaches perform better than the state-of-the-art signal processing approaches in various image restoration tasks. However, if an image contains many patterns and structures, the performance of these CNNs is still inferior. To address this issue, here we propose a novel feature space deep residual learning algorithm that outperforms the existing residual learning. The main idea is originated from the observation that the performance of a learning algorithm can be improved if the input and/or label manifolds can be made topologically simpler by an analytic mapping to a feature space. Our extensive numerical studies using denoising experiments and NTIRE single-image super-resolution (SISR) competition demonstrate that the proposed feature space residual learning outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, our algorithm was ranked high in the NTIRE competition with 5-10 times faster computational time compared to the top ranked teams.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w12/html/Bae_Beyond_Deep_Residual_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Woong Bae, Jaejun Yoo, Jong Chul Ye
Beyond Instance-Level Image Retrieval: Leveraging Captions to Learn a Global Visual Representation for Semantic Retrieval	Querying with an example image is a simple and intuitive interface to retrieve information from a visual database. Most of the research in image retrieval has focused on the task of instance-level image retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve images that contain the same object instance as the query image. In this work we move beyond instance-level retrieval and consider the task of semantic image retrieval in complex scenes, where the goal is to retrieve images that share the same semantics as the query image. We show that, despite its subjective nature, the task of semantically ranking visual scenes is consistently implemented across a pool of human annotators. We also show that a similarity based on human-annotated region-level captions is highly correlated with the human ranking and constitutes a good computable surrogate. Following this observation, we learn a visual embedding of the images where the similarity in the visual space is correlated with their semantic similarity surrogate. We further extend our model to learn a joint embedding of visual and textual cues that allows one to query the database using a text modifier in addition to the query image, adapting the results to the modifier. Finally, our model can ground the ranking decisions by showing regions that contributed the most to the similarity between pairs of images, providing a visual explanation of the similarity.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Gordo_Beyond_Instance-Level_Image_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Albert Gordo, Diane Larlus
Beyond Triplet Loss: A Deep Quadruplet Network for Person Re-Identification	Person re-identification (ReID) is an important task in wide area video surveillance which focuses on identifying people across different cameras. Recently, deep learning networks with a triplet loss become a common framework for person ReID. However, the triplet loss pays main attentions on obtaining correct orders on the training set. It still suffers from a weaker generalization capability from the training set to the testing set, thus resulting in inferior performance. In this paper, we design a quadruplet loss, which can lead to the model output with a larger inter-class variation and a smaller intra-class variation compared to the triplet loss. As a result, our model has a better generalization ability and can achieve a higher performance on the testing set. In particular, a quadruplet deep network using a margin-based online hard negative mining is proposed based on the quadruplet loss for the person ReID. In extensive experiments, the proposed network outperforms most of the state-of-the-art algorithms on representative datasets which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chen_Beyond_Triplet_Loss_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Weihua Chen, Xiaotang Chen, Jianguo Zhang, Kaiqi Huang
Bidirectional Beam Search: Forward-Backward Inference in Neural Sequence Models for Fill-In-The-Blank Image Captioning	We develop the first approximate inference algorithm for 1-Best (and M-Best) decoding in bidirectional neural sequence models by extending Beam Search (BS) to reason about both forward and backward time dependencies. Beam Search (BS) is a widely used approximate inference algorithm for decoding sequences from unidirectional neural sequence models. Interestingly, approximate inference in bidirectional models remains an open problem, despite their significant advantage in modeling information from both the past and future. To enable the use of bidirectional models, we present Bidirectional Beam Search (BiBS), an efficient algorithm for approximate bidirectional inference. To evaluate our method and as an interesting problem in its own right, we introduce a novel Fill-in-the-Blank Image Captioning task which requires reasoning about both past and future sentence structure to reconstruct sensible image descriptions. We use this task as well as the Visual Madlibs dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, consistently outperforming all baseline methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Sun_Bidirectional_Beam_Search_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Qing Sun, Stefan Lee, Dhruv Batra
Bidirectional Multirate Reconstruction for Temporal Modeling in Videos	Despite the recent success of neural networks in image feature learning, a major problem in the video domain is the lack of sufficient labeled data for learning to model temporal information. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised temporal modeling method that learns from untrimmed videos. The speed of motion varies constantly, e.g., a man may run quickly or slowly. We therefore train a Multirate Visual Recurrent Model (MVRM) by encoding frames of a clip with different intervals. This learning process makes the learned model more capable of dealing with motion speed variance. Given a clip sampled from a video, we use its past and future neighboring clips as the temporal context, and reconstruct the two temporal transitions, i.e., present->past transition and present->future transition, reflecting the temporal information in different views. The proposed method exploits the two transitions simultaneously by incorporating a bidirectional reconstruction which consists of a backward reconstruction and a forward reconstruction. We apply the proposed method to two challenging video tasks, i.e., complex event detection and video captioning, in which it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method generates the best single feature for event detection with a relative improvement of 10.4% on the MEDTest-13 dataset and achieves the best performance in video captioning across all evaluation metrics on the YouTube2Text dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhu_Bidirectional_Multirate_Reconstruction_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Linchao Zhu, Zhongwen Xu, Yi Yang
BigHand2.2M Benchmark: Hand Pose Dataset and State of the Art Analysis	In this paper we introduce a large-scale hand pose dataset, collected using a novel capture method. Existing datasets are either generated synthetically or captured using depth sensors: synthetic datasets exhibit a certain level of appearance difference from real depth images, and real datasets are limited in quantity and coverage, mainly due to the difficulty to annotate them. We propose a tracking system with six 6D magnetic sensors and inverse kinematics to automatically obtain 21-joints hand pose annotations of depth maps captured with minimal restriction on the range of motion. The capture protocol aims to fully cover the natural hand pose space. As shown in embedding plots, the new dataset exhibits a significantly wider and denser range of hand poses compared to existing benchmarks. Current state-of-the-art methods are evaluated on the dataset, and we demonstrate significant improvements in cross-benchmark performance. We also show significant improvements in egocentric hand pose estimation with a CNN trained on the new dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yuan_BigHand2.2M_Benchmark_Hand_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shanxin Yuan, Qi Ye, Bjorn Stenger, Siddhant Jain, Tae-Kyun Kim
Binarized Convolutional Neural Networks With Separable Filters for Efficient Hardware Acceleration	State-of-the-art convolutional neural networks are enormously costly in both compute and memory, demanding massively parallel GPUs for execution. Such networks strain the computational capabilities and energy available to embedded and mobile processing platforms, restricting their use in many important applications. In this paper, we propose BCNN with Separable Filters (BCNNw/SF), which applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on BCNN kernels to further reduce computational and storage complexity. We provide a closed form of the gradient over SVD to calculate the exact gradient with respect to every binarized weight in backward propagation. We verify BCNNw/SF on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets, and implement an accelerator for CIFAR10 on FPGA hardware. Our BCNNw/SF accelerator realizes memory savings of 17% and execution time reduction of 31.3% compared to BCNN with only minor accuracy sacrifices.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w4/html/Lin_Binarized_Convolutional_Neural_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jeng-Hau Lin, Tianwei Xing, Ritchie Zhao, Zhiru Zhang, Mani Srivastava, Zhuowen Tu, Rajesh K.

Binarized Mode Seeking for Scalable Visual Pattern Discovery	This paper studies visual pattern discovery in large-scale image collections via binarized mode seeking, where images can only be represented as binary codes for efficient storage and computation. We address this problem from the perspective of binary space mode seeking. First, a binary mean shift (bMS) is proposed to discover frequent patterns via mode seeking directly in binary space. The binomial-based kernel and binary constraint are introduced for binarized analysis. Second, we further extend bMS to a more general form, namely contrastive binary mean shift (cbMS), which maximizes the contrastive density in binary space, for finding informative patterns that are both frequent and discriminative for the dataset. With the binarized algorithm and optimization, our methods demonstrate significant computation (50X) and storage (32X) improvement compared to standard techniques operating in Euclidean space, while the performance does not largely degenerate. Furthermore, cbMS discovers more informative patterns by suppressing low discriminative modes. We evaluate our methods on both annotated ILSVRC (1M images) and un-annotated blind Flickr (10M images) datasets with million scale images, which demonstrates both the scalability and effectiveness of our algorithms for discovering frequent and informative patterns in large scale collection.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Binarized_Mode_Seeking_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Wei Zhang, Xiaochun Cao, Rui Wang, Yuanfang Guo, Zhineng Chen
Binary Coding for Partial Action Analysis With Limited Observation Ratios	Traditional action recognition methods aim to recognize actions with complete observations/executions. However, it is often difficult to capture fully executed actions due to occlusions, interruptions, etc. Meanwhile, action prediction/recognition in advance based on partial observations is essential for preventing the situation from deteriorating. Besides, fast spotting human activities using partially observed data is a critical ingredient for retrieval systems. Inspired by the recent success of data binarization in efficient retrieval/recognition, we propose a novel approach, named Partial Reconstructive Binary Coding (PRBC), for action analysis based on limited frame glimpses during any period of the complete execution. Specifically, we learn discriminative compact binary codes for partial actions via a joint learning framework, which collaboratively tackles feature reconstruction as well as binary coding. We obtain the solution to PRBC based on a discrete alternating iteration algorithm. Extensive experiments on four realistic action datasets in terms of three tasks (i.e., partial action retrieval, recognition and prediction) clearly show the superiority of PRBC over the state-of-the-art methods, along with significantly reduced memory load and computational costs during the online test.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Qin_Binary_Coding_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jie Qin, Li Liu, Ling Shao, Bingbing Ni, Chen Chen, Fumin Shen, Yunhong Wang
Binary Constraint Preserving Graph Matching	Graph matching is a fundamental problem in computer vision and pattern recognition area. In general, it can be formulated as an Integer Quadratic Programming (IQP) problem. Since it is NP-hard, approximate relaxations are required. In this paper, a new graph matching method has been proposed. There are three main contributions of the proposed method: (1) we propose a new graph matching relaxation model, called Binary Constraint Preserving Graph Matching (BPGM), which aims to incorporate the discrete binary mapping constraints more in graph matching relaxation. Our BPGM is motivated by a new observation that the discrete binary constraints in IQP matching problem can be represented (or encoded) exactly by a l2-norm constraint. (2) An effective projection algorithm has been derived to solve BPGM model. (3) Using BPGM, we propose a path-following strategy to optimize IQP matching problem and thus obtain a desired discrete solution at convergence. Promising experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Jiang_Binary_Constraint_Preserving_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Bo Jiang, Jin Tang, Chris Ding, Bin Luo
Binge Watching: Scaling Affordance Learning From Sitcoms	In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in jointly modeling perception and action. At the core of this investigation is the idea of modeling affordances. However, when it comes to predicting affordances, even the state of the art approaches still do not use any ConvNets. Why is that? Unlike semantic or 3D tasks, there still does not exist any large-scale dataset for affordances. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of creating one of the biggest dataset for learning affordances. We use seven sitcoms to extract a diverse set of scenes and how actors interact with different objects in the scenes. Our dataset consists of more than 10K scenes and 28K ways humans can interact with these 10K images. We also propose a two-step approach to predict affordances in a new scene. In the first step, given a location in the scene we classify which of the 30 pose classes is the likely affordance pose. Given the pose class and the scene, we then use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to extract the scale and deformation of the pose. The VAE allows us to sample the distribution of possible poses at test time. Finally, we show the importance of large-scale data in learning a generalizable and robust model of affordances.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_Binge_Watching_Scaling_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xiaolong Wang, Rohit Girdhar, Abhinav Gupta
Blur vs. Block: Investigating the Effectiveness of Privacy-Enhancing Obfuscation for Images	"Computer vision can lead to privacy issues such as unauthorized disclosure of private information and identity theft, but it may also be used to preserve user privacy. For example, using computer vision, we may be able to identify sensitive elements of an image and obfuscate those elements thereby protecting private information or identity. However, there is a lack of research investigating the effectiveness of applying obfuscation techniques to parts of images as a privacy enhancing technology. In particular, we know very little about how well obfuscation works for human viewers or users' attitudes towards using these mechanisms. In this paper, we report results from an online experiment with 53 participants that investigates the effectiveness two exemplar obfuscation techniques: ""blurring"" and ""blocking"", and explores users' perceptions of these obfuscations in terms of image satisfaction, information sufficiency, enjoyment, and social presence. Results show that although ""blocking"" is more effective at de-identification compared to ""blurring"" or leaving the image ""as is"", users' attitudes towards ""blocking"" are the most negative, which creates a conflict between privacy protection and users' experience. Future work should explore alternative obfuscation techniques that could protect users' privacy and also provide a good viewing experience."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w16/html/Caine_Blur_vs._Block_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yifang Li; Nishant Vishwamitra; Bart P.

Borrowing Treasures From the Wealthy: Deep Transfer Learning Through Selective Joint Fine-Tuning	Deep neural networks require a large amount of labeled training data during supervised learning. However, collecting and labeling so much data might be infeasible in many cases. In this paper, we introduce a deep transfer learning scheme, called selective joint fine-tuning, for improving the performance of deep learning tasks with insufficient training data. In this scheme, a target learning task with insufficient training data is carried out simultaneously with another source learning task with abundant training data. However, the source learning task does not use all existing training data. Our core idea is to identify and use a subset of training images from the original source learning task whose low-level characteristics are similar to those from the target learning task, and jointly fine-tune shared convolutional layers for both tasks. Specifically, we compute descriptors from linear or nonlinear filter bank responses on training images from both tasks, and use such descriptors to search for a desired subset of training samples for the source learning task. Experiments demonstrate that our deep transfer learning scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple visual classification tasks with insufficient training data for deep learning. Such tasks include Caltech 256, MIT Indoor 67, and fine-grained classification problems (Oxford Flowers 102 and Stanford Dogs 120). In comparison to fine-tuning without a source domain, the proposed method can improve the classification accuracy by 2% - 10% using a single model. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/ZYYSzj/Selective-Joint-Fine-tuning.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ge_Borrowing_Treasures_From_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Weifeng Ge, Yizhou Yu
Boundary-Aware Instance Segmentation	We address the problem of instance-level semantic seg- mentation, which aims at jointly detecting, segmenting and classifying every individual object in an image. In this con- text, existing methods typically propose candidate objects, usually as bounding boxes, and directly predict a binary mask within each such proposal. As a consequence, they cannot recover from errors in the object candidate genera- tion process, such as too small or shifted boxes. In this paper, we introduce a novel object segment rep- resentation based on the distance transform of the object masks. We then design an object mask network (OMN) with a new residual-deconvolution architecture that infers such a representation and decodes it into the final binary object mask. This allows us to predict masks that go beyond the scope of the bounding boxes and are thus robust to inaccu- rate object candidates. We integrate our OMN into a Mul- titask Network Cascade framework, and learn the result- ing boundary-aware instance segmentation (BAIS) network in an end-to-end manner. Our experiments on the PAS- CAL VOC 2012 and the Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the benefits of our approach, which outperforms the state- of-the-art in both object proposal generation and instance segmentation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Hayder_Boundary-Aware_Instance_Segmentation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zeeshan Hayder, Xuming He, Mathieu Salzmann
BranchOut: Regularization for Online Ensemble Tracking With Convolutional Neural Networks	We propose an extremely simple but effective regularization technique of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), referred to as BranchOut, for online ensemble tracking. Our algorithm employs a CNN for target representation, which has a common convolutional layers but has multiple branches of fully connected layers. For better regularization, a subset of branches in the CNN are selected randomly for online learning whenever target appearance models need to be updated. Each branch may have a different number of layers to maintain variable abstraction levels of target appearances. BranchOut with multi-level target representation allows us to learn robust target appearance models with diversity and handle various challenges in visual tracking problem effectively. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in standard tracking benchmarks and shows the state-of-the-art performance even without additional pretraining on external tracking sequences.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Han_BranchOut_Regularization_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Bohyung Han, Jack Sim, Hartwig Adam
Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification: Is Magnification Important?	Breast cancer is one of the most common cancer in women worldwide. It is typically diagnosed via histopathological microscopy imaging, for which image analysis can aid physicians for more effective diagnosis. Given a large variability in tissue appearance, to better capture discriminative traits, images can be acquired at different optical magnifications. In this paper, we propose an approach which utilizes joint colour-texture features and a classifier ensemble for classifying breast histopathology images. While we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, an important objective of this work is to study the image classification across different optical magnification levels. We provide interesting experimental results and related discussions, demonstrating a visible classification invariance with cross-magnification training-testing. Along with magnification-specific model, we also evaluate the magnification independent model, and compare the two to gain some insights.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w8/html/Gupta_Breast_Cancer_Histopathological_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Vibha Gupta, Arnav Bhavsar
Budget-Aware Deep Semantic Video Segmentation	In this work, we study a poorly understood trade-off between accuracy and runtime costs for deep semantic video segmentation. While recent work has demonstrated advantages of learning to speed-up deep activity detection, it is not clear if similar advantages will hold for our very different segmentation loss function, which is defined over individual pixels across the frames. In deep video segmentation, the most time consuming step represents the application of a CNN to every frame for assigning class labels to every pixel, typically taking 6-9 times of the video footage. This motivates our new budget-aware framework that learns to optimally select a small subset of frames for pixelwise labeling by a CNN, and then efficiently interpolates the obtained segmentations to yet unprocessed frames. This interpolation may use either a simple optical-flow guided mapping of pixel labels, or another significantly less complex and thus faster CNN. We formalize the frame selection as a Markov Decision Process, and specify a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to model a policy for selecting the frames. For training the LSTM, we develop a policy-gradient reinforcement-learning approach for approximating the gradient of our non-decomposable and non-differentiable objective. Evaluation on two benchmark video datasets show that our new framework is able to significantly reduce computation time, and maintain competitive video segmentation accuracy under varying budgets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Mahasseni_Budget-Aware_Deep_Semantic_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Behrooz Mahasseni, Sinisa Todorovic, Alan Fern
Building a Regular Decision Boundary With Deep Networks	In this work, we build a generic architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks to discover empirical properties of neural networks. Our first contribution is to introduce a state-of-the-art framework that depends upon few hyper parameters and to study the network when we vary them. It has no max pooling, no biases, only 13 layers, is purely convolutional and yields up to 95.4% and 79.6% accuracy respectively on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. We show that the nonlinearity of a deep network does not need to be continuous, non expansive or point-wise, to achieve good performance. We show that increasing the width of our network permits being competitive with very deep networks. Our second contribution is an analysis of the contraction and separation properties of this network. Indeed, a 1-nearest neighbor classifier applied on deep features progressively improves with depth, which indicates that the representation is progressively more regular. Besides, we defined and analyzed local support vectors that separate classes locally. All our experiments are reproducible and code will be available online, based on TensorFlow.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Oyallon_Building_a_Regular_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Edouard Oyallon
CASENet: Deep Category-Aware Semantic Edge Detection	Boundary and edge cues are highly beneficial in improving a wide variety of vision tasks such as semantic segmentation, object recognition, stereo, and object proposal generation. Recently, the problem of edge detection has been revisited and significant progress has been made with deep learning. While classical edge detection is a challenging binary problem in itself, the category-aware semantic edge detection by nature is an even more challenging multi-label problem. We model the problem such that each edge pixel can be associated with more than one class as they appear in contours or junctions belonging to two or more semantic classes. To this end, we propose a novel end-to-end deep semantic edge learning architecture based on ResNet and a new skip-layer architecture where category-wise edge activations at the top convolution layer share and are fused with the same set of bottom layer features. We then propose a multi-label loss function to supervise the fused activations. We show that our proposed architecture benefits this problem with better performance, and we outperform the current state-of-the-art semantic edge detection methods by a large margin on standard data sets such as SBD and Cityscapes.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yu_CASENet_Deep_Category-Aware_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhiding Yu, Chen Feng, Ming-Yu Liu, Srikumar Ramalingam
CATS: A Color and Thermal Stereo Benchmark	Stereo matching is a well researched area using visible-band color cameras. Thermal images are typically lower resolution, have less texture, and are noisier compared to their visible-band counterparts and are more challenging for stereo matching algorithms. Previous benchmarks for stereo matching either focus entirely on visible-band cameras or contain only a single thermal camera. We present the Color And Thermal Stereo (CATS) benchmark, a dataset consisting of stereo thermal, stereo color, and cross-modality image pairs with high accuracy ground truth (< 2mm) generated from a LiDAR. We scanned 100 cluttered indoor and 80 outdoor scenes featuring challenging environments and conditions. CATS contains approximately 1400 images of pedestrians, vehicles, electronics, and other thermally interesting objects in different environmental conditions, including nighttime, daytime, and foggy scenes. Ground truth was projected to each of the four cameras to generate color-color, thermal-thermal, and cross-modality disparity maps. We develop a semi-automatic LiDAR to camera alignment procedure that does not require a calibration target. We compare state-of-the-art algorithms to baseline the dataset and show that in the thermal and cross modalities there is still much room for improvement. We expect our dataset to provide researchers with a more diverse set of imaged locations, objects, and modalities than previous benchmarks for stereo matching.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Treible_CATS_A_Color_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Wayne Treible, Philip Saponaro, Scott Sorensen, Abhishek Kolagunda, Michael O'Neal, Brian Phelan, Kelly Sherbondy, Chandra Kambhamettu
CDC: Convolutional-De-Convolutional Networks for Precise Temporal Action Localization in Untrimmed Videos	Temporal action localization is an important yet challenging problem. Given a long, untrimmed video consisting of multiple action instances and complex background contents, we need not only to recognize their action categories, but also to localize the start time and end time of each instance. Many state-of-the-art systems use segment-level classifiers to select and rank proposal segments of pre-determined boundaries. However, a desirable model should move beyond segment-level and make dense predictions at a fine granularity in time to determine precise temporal boundaries. To this end, we design a novel Convolutional-De-Convolutional (CDC) network that places CDC filters on top of 3D ConvNets, which have been shown to be effective for abstracting action semantics but reduce the temporal length of the input data. The proposed CDC filter performs the required temporal upsampling and spatial downsampling operations simultaneously to predict actions at the frame-level granularity. It is unique in jointly modeling action semantics in space-time and fine-grained temporal dynamics. We train the CDC network in an end-to-end manner efficiently. Our model not only achieves superior performance in detecting actions in every frame, but also significantly boosts the precision of localizing temporal boundaries. Finally, the CDC network demonstrates a very high efficiency with the ability to process 500 frames per second on a single GPU server. Source code and trained models are available online at https://bitbucket.org/columbiadvmm/cdc.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Shou_CDC_Convolutional-De-Convolutional_Networks_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zheng Shou, Jonathan Chan, Alireza Zareian, Kazuyuki Miyazawa, Shih-Fu Chang
CERN: Confidence-Energy Recurrent Network for Group Activity Recognition	This work is about recognizing human activities occurring in videos at distinct semantic levels, including individual actions, interactions, and group activities. The recognition is realized using a two-level hierarchy of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, forming a feed-forward deep architecture, which can be trained end-to-end. In comparison with existing architectures of LSTMs, we make two key contributions giving the name to our approach as Confidence-Energy Recurrent Network -- CERN. First, instead of using the common softmax layer for prediction, we specify a novel energy layer (EL) for estimating the energy of our predictions. Second, rather than finding the common minimum-energy class assignment, which may be numerically unstable under uncertainty, we specify that the EL additionally computes the p-values of the solutions, and in this way estimates the most confident energy minimum. The evaluation on the Collective Activity and Volleyball datasets demonstrates: (i) advantages of our two contributions relative to the common softmax and energy-minimization formulations and (ii) a superior performance relative to the state-of-the-art approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Shu_CERN_Confidence-Energy_Recurrent_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tianmin Shu, Sinisa Todorovic, Song-Chun Zhu
CLEVR: A Diagnostic Dataset for Compositional Language and Elementary Visual Reasoning	When building artificial intelligence systems that can reason and answer questions about visual data, we need diagnostic tests to analyze our progress and discover short- comings. Existing benchmarks for visual question answer- ing can help, but have strong biases that models can exploit to correctly answer questions without reasoning. They also conflate multiple sources of error, making it hard to pinpoint model weaknesses. We present a diagnostic dataset that tests a range of visual reasoning abilities. It contains minimal biases and has detailed annotations describing the kind of reasoning each question requires. We use this dataset to analyze a variety of modern visual reasoning systems, providing novel insights into their abilities and limitations.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Johnson_CLEVR_A_Diagnostic_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Justin Johnson, Bharath Hariharan, Laurens van der Maaten, Li Fei-Fei, C.

CLKN: Cascaded Lucas-Kanade Networks for Image Alignment	This paper proposes a data-driven approach for image alignment. Our main contribution is a novel network architecture that combines the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the Lucas-Kanade algorithm. The main component of this architecture is a Lucas-Kanade layer that performs the inverse compositional algorithm on convolutional feature maps. To train our network, we develop a cascaded feature learning method that incorporates the coarse-to-fine strategy into the training process. This method learns a pyramid representation of convolutional features in a cascaded manner and yields a cascaded network that performs coarse-to-fine alignment on the feature pyramids. We apply our model to the task of homography estimation, and perform training and evaluation on a large labeled dataset generated from the MS-COCO dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the other methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chang_CLKN_Cascaded_Lucas-Kanade_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Che-Han Chang, Chun-Nan Chou, Edward Y.

CNN Based Yeast Cell Segmentation in Multi-Modal Fluorescent Microscopy Data	We present a method for foreground segmentation of yeast cells in the presence of high-noise induced by intentional low illumination, where traditional approaches (e.g., threshold-based methods, specialized cell-segmentation methods) fail. To deal with these harsh conditions, we use a fully-convolutional semantic segmentation network based on the SegNet architecture. Our model is capable of segmenting patches extracted from yeast live-cell experiments with a mIOU score of 0.71 on unseen patches drawn from independent experiments. Further, we show that simultaneous multi-modal observations of bio-fluorescent markers can result in better segmentation performance than the DIC channel alone.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w8/html/Aydin_CNN_Based_Yeast_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ali Selman Aydin, Abhinandan Dubey, Daniel Dovrat, Amir Aharoni, Roy Shilkrot
CNN-Based Patch Matching for Optical Flow With Thresholded Hinge Embedding Loss	Learning based approaches have not yet achieved their full potential in optical flow estimation, where their performance still trails heuristic approaches. In this paper, we present a CNN based patch matching approach for optical flow estimation. An important contribution of our approach is a novel thresholded loss for Siamese networks. We demonstrate that our loss performs clearly better than existing losses. It also allows to speed up training by a factor of 2 in our tests. Furthermore, we present a novel way for calculating CNN based features for different image scales, which performs better than existing methods. We also discuss new ways of evaluating the robustness of trained features for the application of patch matching for optical flow. An interesting discovery in our paper is that low-pass filtering of feature maps can increase the robustness of features created by CNNs. We proved the competitive performance of our approach by submitting it to the KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015 and MPI-Sintel evaluation portals where we obtained state-of-the-art results on all three datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Bailer_CNN-Based_Patch_Matching_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Christian Bailer, Kiran Varanasi, Didier Stricker
CNN-SLAM: Real-Time Dense Monocular SLAM With Learned Depth Prediction	Given the recent advances in depth prediction from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this paper investigates how predicted depth maps from a deep neural network can be deployed for the goal of accurate and dense monocular reconstruction. We propose a method where CNN-predicted dense depth maps are naturally fused together with depth measurements obtained from direct monocular SLAM, based on a scheme that privileges depth prediction in image locations where monocular SLAM approaches tend to fail, e.g. along low-textured regions, and vice-versa. We demonstrate the use of depth prediction to estimate the absolute scale of the reconstruction, hence overcoming one of the major limitations of monocular SLAM. Finally, we propose a framework to efficiently fuse semantic labels, obtained from a single frame, with dense SLAM, so to yield semantically coherent scene reconstruction from a single view. Evaluation results on two benchmark datasets show the robustness and accuracy of our approach.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tateno_CNN-SLAM_Real-Time_Dense_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Keisuke Tateno, Federico Tombari, Iro Laina, Nassir Navab
Camera Source Identification Using Discrete Cosine Transform Residue Features and Ensemble Classifier	Machine Learning based model building and classification has proved to be extremely effective for the camera source identification problem.

We improve the classification accuracy by incorporating dimensionality reduction by Principal Component Analysis. Our experimental results on 10,507 images captured by ten cameras from the Dresden Image Database gives an average classification accuracy of 99.1%, and also show low overfitting trends when the constructed classifier is applied on a different image database.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w28/html/Naskar_Camera_Source_Identification_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Aniket Roy; Rajat Subhra Chakraborty; Udaya Sameer; Ruchira Naskar
Can Walking and Measuring Along Chord Bunches Better Describe Leaf Shapes?	Effectively describing and recognizing leaf shapes under arbitrary deformations, particularly from a large database, remains an unsolved problem. In this research, we attempted a new strategy of describing shape by walking along a bunch of chords that pass through the shape to measure the regions trespassed. A novel chord bunch walks (CBW) descriptor is developed through the chord walking that effectively integrates the shape image function over the walked chord to reflect the contour features and the inner properties of the shape. For each contour point, the chord bunch groups multiple pairs of chord walks to build a hierarchical framework for a coarse-to-fine description. The proposed CBW descriptor is invariant to rotation, scaling, translation, and mirror transforms. Instead of using the expensive optimal correspondence based matching, an improved Hausdorff distance encoded correspondence information is proposed for efficient yet effective shape matching. In experimental studies, the proposed method obtained substantially higher accuracies with low computational cost over the benchmarks, which indicates the research potential along this direction.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_Can_Walking_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Bin Wang, Yongsheng Gao, Changming Sun, Michael Blumenstein, John La Salle
Captioning Images With Diverse Objects	Recent captioning models are limited in their ability to scale and describe concepts unseen in paired image-text corpora. We propose the Novel Object Captioner (NOC), a deep visual semantic captioning model that can describe a large number of object categories not present in existing image-caption datasets. Our model takes advantage of external sources -- labeled images from object recognition datasets, and semantic knowledge extracted from unannotated text. We propose minimizing a joint objective which can learn from these diverse data sources and leverage distributional semantic embeddings, enabling the model to generalize and describe novel objects outside of image-caption datasets. We demonstrate that our model exploits semantic information to generate captions for hundreds of object categories in the ImageNet object recognition dataset that are not observed in MSCOCO image-caption training data, as well as many categories that are observed very rarely. Both automatic evaluations and human judgements show that our model considerably outperforms prior work in being able to describe many more categories of objects.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Venugopalan_Captioning_Images_With_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Subhashini Venugopalan, Lisa Anne Hendricks, Marcus Rohrbach, Raymond Mooney, Trevor Darrell, Kate Saenko
Cartooning for Enhanced Privacy in Lifelogging and Streaming Videos	We describe an object replacement approach whereby privacy-sensitive objects in videos are replaced by abstract cartoons taken from clip art. Our approach uses a combination of computer vision, deep learning, and image processing techniques to detect objects, abstract details, and replace them with cartoon clip art. We conducted a user study (N=85) to discern the utility and effectiveness of our cartoon replacement technique. The results suggest that our object replacement approach preserves a video's semantic content while improving its privacy by obscuring details of objects.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w16/html/Kapadia_Cartooning_for_Enhanced_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Eman T.

Caught Red-Handed: Toward Practical Video-Based Subsequences Matching in the Presence of Real-World Transformations	Every minute, staggering amounts of user-generated videos are uploaded to on-line social networks. These videos can generate significant advertising revenue, providing strong incentive for unscrupulous individuals that wish to capitalize on this bonanza by pirating short clips from popular content and altering the copied media in ways that might bypass detection. Unfortunately, while the challenges posed by the use of skillful transformations has been known for quite some time, current state-of-the-art methods still suffer from severe limitations. Indeed, most of today's techniques perform poorly in the face of real world copies. To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages temporal characteristics to identify subsequences of a video that were copied from elsewhere. Our approach takes advantage of a new temporal feature to index a reference library in a manner that is robust to popular spatial and temporal transformations in pirated videos. Our experimental evaluation on 27 hours of video obtained from social networks demonstrates that our technique significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches with respect to accuracy, resilience, and efficiency.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w16/html/Frahm_Caught_Red-Handed_Toward_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yi Xu; True Price; Fabian Monrose; Jan-Michael Frahm
ChestX-ray8: Hospital-Scale Chest X-Ray Database and Benchmarks on Weakly-Supervised Classification and Localization of Common Thorax Diseases	"The chest X-ray is one of the most commonly accessible radiological examinations for screening and diagnosis of many lung diseases. A tremendous number of X-ray imaging studies accompanied by radiological reports are accumulated and stored in many modern hospitals' Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS). On the other side, it is still an open question how this type of hospital-size knowledge database containing invaluable imaging informatics (i.e., loosely labeled) can be used to facilitate the data-hungry deep learning paradigms in building truly large-scale high precision computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. In this paper, we present a new chest X-ray database, namely ""ChestX-ray8"", which comprises 108,948 frontal-view X-ray images of 32,717 unique patients with the text-mined eight disease image labels (where each image can have multi-labels), from the associated radiological reports using natural language processing. Importantly, we demonstrate that these commonly occurring thoracic diseases can be detected and even spatially-located via a unified weakly-supervised multi-label image classification and disease localization framework, which is validated using our proposed dataset. Although the initial quantitative results are promising as reported, deep convolutional neural network based ""reading chest X-rays"" (i.e., recognizing and locating the common disease patterns trained with only image-level labels) remains a strenuous task for fully-automated high precision CAD systems."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_ChestX-ray8_Hospital-Scale_Chest_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xiaosong Wang, Yifan Peng, Le Lu, Zhiyong Lu, Mohammadhadi Bagheri, Ronald M.

CityPersons: A Diverse Dataset for Pedestrian Detection	Convnets have enabled significant progress in pedestrian detection recently, but there are still open questions regard- ing suitable architectures and training data. We revisit CNN design and point out key adaptations, enabling plain Fas- terRCNN to obtain state-of-the-art results on the Caltech dataset. To achieve further improvement from more and better data, we introduce CityPersons, a new set of person annotations on top of the Cityscapes dataset. The di- versity of CityPersons allows us for the first time to train one single CNN model that generalizes well over mul- tiple benchmarks. Moreover, with additional training with CityPersons, we obtain top results using FasterRCNN on Caltech, improving especially for more difficult cases (heavy occlusion and small scale) and providing higher loc- alization quality.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_CityPersons_A_Diverse_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shanshan Zhang, Rodrigo Benenson, Bernt Schiele
Classification and Retrieval of Digital Pathology Scans: A New Dataset	In this paper, we introduce a new dataset, Kimia Path24, for image classification and retrieval in digital pathology. We use the whole scan images of 24 different tissue textures to generate 1,325 test patches of size 1000x1000 (0.5mm x 0.5mm). Training data can be generated according to preferences of algorithm designer and can range from approximately 27,000 to over 50,000 patches if the preset parameters are adopted. We propose a compound patch-and-scan accuracy measurement that makes achieving high accuracies quite challenging. In addition, we set the benchmarking line by applying LBP, dictionary approach and convolutional neural nets (CNNs) and report their results. The highest accuracy was 41.80% for CNN.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w8/html/Babaie_Classification_and_Retrieval_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Morteza Babaie, Shivam Kalra, Aditya Sriram, Christopher Mitcheltree, Shujin Zhu, Amin Khatami, Shahryar Rahnamayan, Hamid R.

Classification of Puck Possession Events in Ice Hockey	Group activity recognition in sports is often challenging due to the complex dynamics and interaction among the players. In this paper, we propose a recurrent neural network to classify puck possession events in ice hockey. Our method extracts features from the whole frame and appearances of the players using a pre-trained convolutional neural network. In this way, our model captures the context information, individual attributes and interaction among the players. Our model requires only the player positions on the image and does not need any explicit annotations for the individual actions or player trajectories, greatly simplifying the input of the system. We evaluate our model on a new Ice Hockey Dataset. Experimental results show that our model produces competitive results on this challenging dataset with much simpler inputs compared with the previous work.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w2/html/Tora_Classification_of_Puck_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Moumita Roy Tora, Jianhui Chen, James J.

Cluster-Wise Ratio Tests for Fast Camera Localization	Feature point matching for camera localization suffers from scalability problems. Even when feature descriptors associated with 3D scene points are locally unique, as coverage grows, similar or repeated features become increasingly common. As a result, the standard distance ratio-test used to identify reliable image feature points is overly restrictive and rejects many good candidate matches. We propose a simple coarse-to-fine strategy that uses conservative approximations to robust local ratio-tests that can be computed efficiently using global approximate k-nearest neighbor search. We treat these forward matches as votes in camera pose space and use them to prioritize back-matching within candidate camera pose clusters, exploiting feature co-visibility captured by the 3D model camera pose graph. This approach achieves state-of-the-art camera pose estimation results on a variety of benchmarks, outperforming several methods that use more complicated data structures and that make more restrictive assumptions on camera pose. We carry out diagnostic analyses on a difficult test dataset containing globally repetitive structure which suggest our approach successfully adapts to the challenges of large-scale pose estimation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w10/html/Diaz_Cluster-Wise_Ratio_Tests_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Raul Diaz, Charless C.

Co-Occurrence Filter	Co-occurrence Filter (CoF) is a boundary preserving filter. It is based on the Bilateral Filter (BF) but instead of using a Gaussian on the range values to preserve edges it relies on a co-occurrence matrix. Pixel values that co-occur frequently in the image (i.e., inside textured regions) will have a high weight in the co-occurrence matrix. This, in turn, means that such pixel pairs will be averaged and hence smoothed, regardless of their intensity differences. On the other hand, pixel values that rarely co-occur (i.e., across texture boundaries) will have a low weight in the co-occurrence matrix. As a result, they will not be averaged and the boundary between them will be preserved. The CoF therefore extends the BF to deal with boundaries, not just edges. It learns co-occurrences directly from the image. We can achieve various filtering results by directing it to learn the co-occurrence matrix from a part of the image, or a different image. We give the definition of the filter, discuss how to use it with color images and show several use cases.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Jevnisek_Co-Occurrence_Filter_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Roy J.

CoMaL Tracking: Tracking Points at the Object Boundaries	Traditional point tracking algorithms such as the KLT use local 2D information aggregation for feature detection and tracking, due to which their performance degrades at the object boundaries that separate multiple objects. Recently, CoMaL Features have been proposed that handle such a case. However, they proposed a simple tracking framework where the points are re-detected in each frame and matched. This is inefficient and may also lose many points that are not re-detected in the next frame. We propose a novel tracking algorithm to accurately and efficiently track CoMaL points. For this, the level line segment associated with the CoMaL points is matched to MSER segments in the next frame using shape-based matching and the matches are further filtered using texture-based matching. Experiments show improvements over a simple re-detect-and-match framework as well as KLT in terms of speed/accuracy on different real-world applications, especially at the object boundaries.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w34/html/Ramakrishnan_CoMaL_Tracking_Tracking_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Santhosh K.

Coarse-To-Fine Segmentation With Shape-Tailored Continuum Scale Spaces	We formulate an energy for segmentation that is designed to have preference for segmenting the coarse over fine structure of the image, without smoothing across boundaries of regions. The energy is formulated by integrating a continuum of scales from a scale space computed from the heat equation within regions. We show that the energy can be optimized without computing a continuum of scales, but instead from a single scale. This makes the method computationally efficient in comparison to energies using a discrete set of scales. We apply our method to texture and motion segmentation. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that a continuum of scales leads to better segmentation accuracy over discrete scales and other competing methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Khan_Coarse-To-Fine_Segmentation_With_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Naeemullah Khan, Byung-Woo Hong, Anthony Yezzi, Ganesh Sundaramoorthi
Coarse-To-Fine Volumetric Prediction for Single-Image 3D Human Pose	This paper addresses the challenge of 3D human pose estimation from a single color image. Despite the general success of the end-to-end learning paradigm, top performing approaches employ a two-step solution consisting of a Convolutional Network (ConvNet) for 2D joint localization and a subsequent optimization step to recover 3D pose. In this paper, we identify the representation of 3D pose as a critical issue with current ConvNet approaches and make two important contributions towards validating the value of end-to-end learning for this task. First, we propose a fine discretization of the 3D space around the subject and train a ConvNet to predict per voxel likelihoods for each joint. This creates a natural representation for 3D pose and greatly improves performance over the direct regression of joint coordinates. Second, to further improve upon initial estimates, we employ a coarse-to-fine prediction scheme. This step addresses the large dimensionality increase and enables iterative refinement and repeated processing of the image features. The proposed approach outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks achieving a relative error reduction greater than 30% on average. Additionally, we investigate using our volumetric representation in a related architecture which is suboptimal compared to our end-to-end approach, but is of practical interest, since it enables training when no image with corresponding 3D groundtruth is available, and allows us to present compelling results for in-the-wild images.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Pavlakos_Coarse-To-Fine_Volumetric_Prediction_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Georgios Pavlakos, Xiaowei Zhou, Konstantinos G.

Cognitive Mapping and Planning for Visual Navigation	"We introduce a neural architecture for navigation in novel environments. Our proposed architecture learns to map from first-person views and plans a sequence of actions towards goals in the environment. The Cognitive Mapper and Planner (CMP) is based on two key ideas: a) a unified joint architecture for mapping and planning, such that the mapping is driven by the needs of the planner, and b) a spatial memory with the ability to plan given an incomplete set of observations about the world. CMP constructs a top-down belief map of the world and applies a differentiable neural net planner to produce the next action at each time step. The accumulated belief of the world enables the agent to track visited regions of the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that CMP outperforms both reactive strategies and standard memory-based architectures and performs well in novel environments. Furthermore, we show that CMP can also achieve semantically specified goals, such as ""go to a chair""."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Gupta_Cognitive_Mapping_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Saurabh Gupta, James Davidson, Sergey Levine, Rahul Sukthankar, Jitendra Malik
Collaborative Deep Reinforcement Learning for Joint Object Search	We examine the problem of joint top-down active search of multiple objects under interaction, e.g., person riding a bicycle, cups held by the table, etc.. Such objects under interaction often can provide contextual cues to each other to facilitate more efficient search. By treating each detector as an agent, we present the first collaborative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the optimal policy for joint active object localization, which effectively exploits such beneficial contextual information. We learn inter-agent communication through cross connections with gates between the Q-networks, which is facilitated by a novel multi-agent deep Q-learning algorithm with joint exploitation sampling. We verify our proposed method on multiple object detection benchmarks. Not only does our model help to improve the performance of state-of-the-art active localization models, it also reveals interesting co-detection patterns that are intuitively interpretable.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kong_Collaborative_Deep_Reinforcement_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xiangyu Kong, Bo Xin, Yizhou Wang, Gang Hua
Collaborative Summarization of Topic-Related Videos	"Large collections of videos are grouped into clusters by a topic keyword, such as ""Eiffel Tower"" or ""Surfing"", with many important visual concepts repeating across them. Such a topically close set of videos have mutual influence on each other, which could be used to summarize one of them by exploiting information from others in the set. We build on this intuition to develop a novel approach to extract a summary that simultaneously captures both important particularities arising in the given video, as well as, generalities identified from the set of videos. The topic-related videos provide visual context to identify the important parts of the video being summarized. We achieve this by developing a collaborative sparse optimization method which can be efficiently solved by a half-quadratic minimization algorithm. Our work builds upon the idea of collaborative techniques from information retrieval and natural language processing, which typically use the attributes of other similar objects to predict the attribute of a given object. Experiments on two challenging and diverse datasets well demonstrate the efficacy of our approach over state-of-the-art methods."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Panda_Collaborative_Summarization_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Rameswar Panda, Amit K.

Colorization as a Proxy Task for Visual Understanding	We investigate and improve self-supervision as a drop-in replacement for ImageNet pretraining, focusing on automatic colorization as the proxy task. Self-supervised training has been shown to be more promising for utilizing unlabeled data than other, traditional unsupervised learning methods. We build on this success and evaluate the ability of our self-supervised network in several contexts. On VOC segmentation and classification tasks, we present results that are state-of-the-art among methods not using ImageNet labels for pretraining representations. Moreover, we present the first in-depth analysis of self-supervision via colorization, concluding that formulation of the loss, training details and network architecture play important roles in its effectiveness. This investigation is further expanded by revisiting the ImageNet pretraining paradigm, asking questions such as: How much training data is needed? How many labels are needed? How much do features change when fine-tuned? We relate these questions back to self-supervision by showing that colorization provides a similarly powerful supervisory signal as various flavors of ImageNet pretraining.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Larsson_Colorization_as_a_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Gustav Larsson, Michael Maire, Gregory Shakhnarovich
Combining Bottom-Up, Top-Down, and Smoothness Cues for Weakly Supervised Image Segmentation	This paper addresses the problem of weakly supervised semantic image segmentation. Our goal is to label every pixel in a new image, given only image-level object labels associated with training images. Our problem statement differs from common semantic segmentation, where pixel-wise annotations are typically assumed available in training. We specify a novel deep architecture which fuses three distinct computation processes toward semantic segmentation -- namely, (i) the bottom-up computation of neural activations in a CNN for the image-level prediction of object classes; (ii) the top-down estimation of conditional likelihoods of the CNN's activations given the predicted objects, resulting in probabilistic attention maps per object class; and (iii) the lateral attention-message passing from neighboring neurons at the same CNN layer. The fusion of (i)-(iii) is realized via a conditional random field as recurrent network aimed at generating a smooth and boundary-preserving segmentation. Unlike existing work, we formulate a unified end-to-end learning of all components of our deep architecture. Evaluation on the benchmark PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrates that we outperform reasonable weakly supervised baselines and state-of-the-art approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Roy_Combining_Bottom-Up_Top-Down_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Anirban Roy, Sinisa Todorovic
Commonly Uncommon: Semantic Sparsity in Situation Recognition	Semantic sparsity is a common challenge in structured visual classification problems; when the output space is complex, the vast majority of the possible predictions are rarely, if ever, seen in the training set. This paper studies semantic sparsity in situation recognition, the task of producing structured summaries of what is happening in images, including activities, objects and the roles objects play within the activity. For this problem, we find empirically that most substructures required for prediction are rare, and current state-of-the-art model performance dramatically decreases if even one such rare substructure exists in the target output.We avoid many such errors by (1) introducing a novel tensor composition function that learns to share examples across substructures more effectively and (2) se- mantically augmenting our training data with automatically gathered examples of rarely observed outputs using web data. When integrated within a complete CRF-based structured prediction model, the tensor-based approach outperforms existing state of the art by a relative improvement of 2.11% and 4.40% on top-5 verb and noun-role accuracy, respectively. Adding 5 million images with our semantic aug- mentation techniques gives further relative improvements of 6.23% and 9.57% on top-5 verb and noun-role accuracy.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yatskar_Commonly_Uncommon_Semantic_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mark Yatskar, Vicente Ordonez, Luke Zettlemoyer, Ali Farhadi
Compact Matrix Factorization With Dependent Subspaces	Traditional matrix factorization methods approximate high dimensional data with a low dimensional subspace. This imposes constraints on the matrix elements which allow for estimation of missing entries. A lower rank provides stronger constraints and makes estimation of the missing entries less ambiguous at the cost of measurement fit. In this paper we propose a new factorization model that further constrains the matrix entries. Our approach can be seen as a unification of traditional low-rank matrix factorization and the more recent union-of-subspace approach. It adaptively finds clusters that can be modeled with low dimensional local subspaces and simultaneously uses a global rank constraint to capture the overall scene interactions. For inference we use an energy that penalizes a trade-off between data fit and degrees-of-freedom of the resulting factorization. We show qualitatively and quantitatively that regularizing both local and global dynamics yields significantly improved missing data estimation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Larsson_Compact_Matrix_Factorization_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Viktor Larsson, Carl Olsson
Comparative Evaluation of Hand-Crafted and Learned Local Features	Matching local image descriptors is a key step in many computer vision applications. For more than a decade, hand-crafted descriptors such as SIFT have been used for this task. Recently, multiple new descriptors learned from data have been proposed and shown to improve on SIFT in terms of discriminative power. This paper is dedicated to an extensive experimental evaluation of learned local features to establish a single evaluation protocol that ensures comparable results. In terms of matching performance, we evaluate the different descriptors regarding standard criteria. However, considering matching performance in isolation only provides an incomplete measure of a descriptor's quality. For example, finding additional correct matches between similar images does not necessarily lead to a better performance when trying to match images under extreme viewpoint or illumination changes. Besides pure descriptor matching, we thus also evaluate the different descriptors in the context of image-based reconstruction. This enables us to study the descriptor performance on a set of more practical criteria including image retrieval, the ability to register images under strong viewpoint and illumination changes, and the accuracy and completeness of the reconstructed cameras and scenes. To facilitate future research, the full evaluation pipeline is made publicly available.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Schonberger_Comparative_Evaluation_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Johannes L.

Component Biologically Inspired Features With Moving Segmentation for Age Estimation	We propose the Component Bio-Inspired Feature (CBIF) with a moving segmentation scheme for age estimation. The CBIF defines a superset for the commonly used Bio-Inspired Feature (BIF) with more parameters and flexibility in settings, resulting in features with abundant characteristics. An in-depth study is performed for the determination of the parameters good for capturing age-related traits. The moving segmentation is proposed to better determine the age boundaries good for age grouping, and improve the overall performance. The proposed approach is evaluated on two common benchmarks, FG-NET and MORPH databases, and compared with contemporary approaches to demonstrate its efficacy.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w6/html/Hsu_Component_Biologically_Inspired_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Gee-Sern Jison Hsu, Yi-Tseng Cheng, Choon Ching Ng, Moi Hoon Yap
Comprehension-Guided Referring Expressions	"We consider generation and comprehension of natural language referring expression for objects in an image. Unlike generic ""image captioning"" which lacks natural standard evaluation criteria, quality of a referring expression may be measured by the receiver's ability to correctly infer which object is being described. Following this intuition, we propose two approaches to utilize models trained for comprehension task to generate better expressions. First, we use a comprehension module trained on human-generated expressions, as a ""critic"" of referring expression generator. The comprehension module serves as a differentiable proxy of human evaluation, providing training signal to the generation module. Second, we use the comprehension model in a generate-and-rerank pipeline, which chooses from candidate expressions generated by a model according to their performance on the comprehension task. We show that both approaches lead to improved referring expression generation on multiple benchmark datasets."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Luo_Comprehension-Guided_Referring_Expressions_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ruotian Luo, Gregory Shakhnarovich
Compressive Light Field Reconstructions Using Deep Learning	Single-shot light field cameras typically sacrifice spatial resolution to sample angular viewpoints, multiplexing rays onto a 2D sensor array. Using compressive sensing to recover this resolution requires long processing times for iterative solvers. We present a new, two branch neural network architecture to efficiently recover a high resolution 4D light field from a single coded 2D image. This network achieves average PSNR values of 26-32 dB on simulated data, outperforming the baseline of dictionary-based learning. In addition, reconstruction time is decreased from 35 minutes to 6.7 minutes compared to the dictionary method for equivalent visual quality at small sampling/compression ratios as low as 8%. We test our network reconstructions on synthetic light fields, simulated coded measurements of real Lytro Illum light fields, and real coded data from a custom CMOS diffractive light field camera to show the potential for real-time light field video systems in the future.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w15/html/Gupta_Compressive_Light_Field_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mayank Gupta, Arjun Jauhari, Kuldeep Kulkarni, Suren Jayasuriya, Alyosha Molnar, Pavan Turaga
Computational Imaging on the Electric Grid	Night beats with alternating current (AC) illumination. By passively sensing this beat, we reveal new scene information which includes: the type of bulbs in the scene, the phases of the electric grid up to city scale, and the light transport matrix. This information yields unmixing of reflections and semi-reflections, nocturnal high dynamic range, and scene rendering with bulbs not observed during acquisition. The latter is facilitated by a database of bulb response functions for a range of sources, which we collected and provide. To do all this, we built a novel coded-exposure high-dynamic-range imaging technique, specifically designed to operate on the grid's AC lighting.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Sheinin_Computational_Imaging_on_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mark Sheinin, Yoav Y.

Concurrence-Aware Long Short-Term Sub-Memories for Person-Person Action Recognition	Recently, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has become a popular choice to model individual dynamics for single-person action recognition. However, existing RNN models only focus on capturing the temporal dynamics of the person-person interactions by naively combining the activity dynamics of individuals or modeling them as a whole. This neglects the inter-related dynamics of how person-person interactions change over time. To this end, we propose a novel Concurrent Long Short-Term Memories (Co-LSTM) to model the long-term inter-related dynamics between two interacting people on the bonding boxes covering people. Specifically, for each frame, two sub-memory units store individual motion information, while a concurrent LSTM unit selectively integrates and stores inter-related motion information between interacting people from these two sub-memory units via a new co-memory cell. In experiments, we show the superior performance of Co-LSTM compared with the state-of-the-arts.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w37/html/Shu_Concurrence-Aware_Long_Short-Term_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xiangbo Shu, Jinhui Tang, Guo-Jun Qi, Yan Song, Zechao Li, Liyan Zhang
Conditional Similarity Networks	What makes images similar? To measure the similarity between images, they are typically embedded in a feature-vector space, in which their distance preserve the relative dissimilarity. However, when learning such similarity embeddings the simplifying assumption is commonly made that images are only compared to one unique measure of similarity. A main reason for this is that contradicting notions of similarities cannot be captured in a single space. To address this shortcoming, we propose Conditional Similarity Networks (CSNs) that learn embeddings differentiated into semantically distinct subspaces that capture the different notions of similarities. CSNs jointly learn a disentangled embedding where features for different similarities are encoded in separate dimensions as well as masks that select and reweight relevant dimensions to induce a subspace that encodes a specific similarity notion. We show that our approach learns interpretable image representations with visually relevant semantic subspaces. Further, when evaluating on triplet questions from multiple similarity notions our model even outperforms the accuracy obtained by training individual specialized networks for each notion separately.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Veit_Conditional_Similarity_Networks_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Andreas Veit, Serge Belongie, Theofanis Karaletsos
Connecting Look and Feel: Associating the Visual and Tactile Properties of Physical Materials	For machines to interact with the physical world, they must understand the physical properties of objects and materials they encounter. We use fabrics as an example of a deformable material with a rich set of mechanical properties. A thin flexible fabric, when draped, tends to look different from a heavy stiff fabric. It also feels different when touched. Using a collection of 118 fabric samples, we captured color and depth images of draped fabrics along with tactile data from a high-resolution touch sensor. We then sought to associate the information from vision and touch by jointly training CNN's across the three modalities. Through the CNN, each input, regardless of the modality, generates an embedding vector that records the fabric's physical property. By comparing the embedding vectors, our system is able to look at a fabric image and predict how it will feel, and vice versa. We also show that a system jointly trained on vision and touch data can outperform a similar system trained only on visual data when tested purely with visual inputs.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yuan_Connecting_Look_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Wenzhen Yuan, Shaoxiong Wang, Siyuan Dong, Edward Adelson
Consensus Maximization With Linear Matrix Inequality Constraints	Consensus maximization has proven to be a useful tool for robust estimation. While randomized methods like RANSAC are fast, they do not guarantee global optimality and fail to manage large amounts of outliers. On the other hand, global methods are commonly slow because they do not exploit the structure of the problem at hand. In this paper, we show that the solution space can be reduced by introducing Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) constraints. This leads to significant speed ups of the optimization time even for large amounts of outliers, while maintaining global optimality. We study several cases in which the objective variables have a special structure, such as rotation, scaled-rotation, and essential matrices, which are posed as LMI constraints. This is very useful in several standard computer vision problems, such as estimating Similarity Transformations, Absolute Poses, and Relative Poses, for which we obtain compelling results on both synthetic and real datasets. With up to 90 percent outlier rate, where RANSAC often fails, our constrained approach is consistently faster than the non-constrained one - while finding the same global solution.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Speciale_Consensus_Maximization_With_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Pablo Speciale, Danda Pani Paudel, Martin R.

Consistent-Aware Deep Learning for Person Re-Identification in a Camera Network	In this paper, we propose a consistent-aware deep learning (CADL) framework for person re-identification in a camera network. Unlike most existing person re-identification methods which identify whether two body images are from the same person, our approach aims to obtain the maximal correct matches for the whole camera network. Different from recently proposed camera network based re-identification methods which only consider the consistent information in the matching stage to obtain a global optimal association, we exploit such consistent-aware information under a deep learning framework where both feature representation and image matching are automatically learned with certain consistent constraints. Specifically, we reach the global optimal solution and balance the performance between different cameras by optimizing the similarity and association iteratively. Experimental results show that our method obtains significant performance improvement and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by large margins.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lin_Consistent-Aware_Deep_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ji Lin, Liangliang Ren, Jiwen Lu, Jianjiang Feng, Jie Zhou
Context-Aware Captions From Context-Agnostic Supervision	"We introduce an inference technique to produce discriminative context-aware image captions (captions that describe differences between images or visual concepts) using only generic context-agnostic training data (captions that describe a concept or an image in isolation). For example, given images and captions of ""siamese cat"" and ""tiger cat"", we generate language that describes the ""siamese cat"" in a way that distinguishes it from ""tiger cat"". Our key novelty is that we show how to do joint inference over a language model that is context-agnostic and a listener which distinguishes closely-related concepts. We first apply our technique to a justification task, namely to describe why an image contains a particular fine-grained category as opposed to another closely-related category of the CUB- 200-2011 dataset. We then study discriminative image captioning to generate language that uniquely refers to one of two semantically-similar images in the COCO dataset.

A significant amount of recent research focuses on the incorporation of stronger features for a richer representation of the tracking target. However, this only helps to discriminate the target from background within a small neighborhood. In this paper, we present a framework that allows the explicit incorporation of global context within CF trackers. We reformulate the original optimization problem and provide a closed form solution for single and multi-dimensional features in the primal and dual domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this framework significantly improves the performance of many CF trackers with only a modest impact on frame rate.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Mueller_Context-Aware_Correlation_Filter_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Matthias Mueller, Neil Smith, Bernard Ghanem
Continuous Video to Simple Signals for Swimming Stroke Detection With Convolutional Neural Networks	In many sports, it is useful to analyse video of an athlete in competition for training purposes. In swimming, stroke rate is a common metric used by coaches; requiring a laborious labelling of each individual stroke. We show that using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) we can automatically detect discrete events in continuous video (in this case, swimming strokes). We create a CNN that learns a mapping from a window of frames to a point on a smooth 1D target signal, with peaks denoting the location of a stroke, evaluated as a sliding window. To our knowledge this process of training and utilizing a CNN has not been investigated before; either in sports or fundamental computer vision research. Most research has been focused on action recognition and using it to classify many clips in continuous video for action localisation. In this paper we demonstrate our process works well on the task of detecting swimming strokes in the wild.

Contour-Constrained Superpixels for Image and Video Processing	A novel contour-constrained superpixel (CCS) algorithm is proposed in this work. We initialize superpixels and regions in a regular grid and then refine the superpixel label of each region hierarchically from block to pixel levels. To make superpixel boundaries compatible with object contours, we propose the notion of contour pattern matching and formulate an objective function including the contour constraint. Furthermore, we extend the CCS algorithm to generate temporal superpixels for video processing. We initialize superpixel labels in each frame by transferring those in the previous frame and refine the labels to make superpixels temporally consistent as well as compatible with object contours. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides better performance than the state-of-the-art superpixel methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lee_Contour-Constrained_Superpixels_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Se-Ho Lee, Won-Dong Jang, Chang-Su Kim
Controlling Perceptual Factors in Neural Style Transfer	Neural Style Transfer has shown very exciting results enabling new forms of image manipulation. Here we extend the existing method to introduce control over spatial location, colour information and across spatial scale. We demonstrate how this enhances the method by allowing high-resolution controlled stylisation and helps to alleviate common failure cases such as applying ground textures to sky regions. Furthermore, by decomposing style into these perceptual factors we enable the combination of style information from multiple sources to generate new, perceptually appealing styles from existing ones. We also describe how these methods can be used to more efficiently produce large size, high-quality stylisation. Finally we show how the introduced control measures can be applied in recent methods for Fast Neural Style Transfer.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Gatys_Controlling_Perceptual_Factors_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Leon A.

Convex Global 3D Registration With Lagrangian Duality	"The registration of 3D models by a Euclidean transformation is a fundamental task at the core of many application in computer vision. This problem is non-convex due to the presence of rotational constraints, making traditional local optimization methods prone to getting stuck in local minima. This paper addresses finding the globally optimal transformation in various 3D registration problems by a unified formulation that integrates common geometric registration modalities (namely point-to-point, point-to-line and point-to-plane). This formulation renders the optimization problem independent of both the number and nature of the correspondences. The main novelty of our proposal is the introduction of a strengthened Lagrangian dual relaxation for this problem, which surpasses previous similar approaches [32] in effectiveness. In fact, even though with no theoretical guarantees, exhaustive empirical evaluation in both synthetic and real experiments always resulted on a tight relaxation that allowed to recover a guaranteed globally optimal solution by exploiting duality theory. Thus, our approach allows for effectively solving the 3D registration with global optimality guarantees while running at a fraction of the time for the state-of-the-art alternative [34], based on a more computationally intensive Branch and Bound method.

Convolutional Experts Constrained Local Model for Facial Landmark Detection	Constrained Local Models (CLMs) are a well- established family of methods for facial landmark detection. However, they have recently fallen out of favor to cascaded regression-based approaches. This is in part due to the inability of existing CLM local detectors to model the very complex individual landmark appearance that is affected by expression, illumination, facial hair, makeup, and accessories. In our work, we present a novel local detector - Convolutional Experts Network (CEN) - that brings together the advantages of neural architectures and mixtures of experts in an end-to-end framework. We further propose a Convolutional Experts Constrained Local Model (CE-CLM) algorithm that uses CEN as local detectors. We demonstrate that our proposed CE-CLM algorithm outperforms competitive state-of-the-art baselines for facial landmark detection by a large margin. Our approach is especially accurate and robust on challenging profile images.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w33/html/Zadeh_Convolutional_Experts_Constrained_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Amir Zadeh, Tadas Baltrusaitis, Louis-Philippe Morency
Convolutional Neural Network Architecture for Geometric Matching	We address the problem of determining correspondences between two images in agreement with a geometric model such as an affine or thin-plate spline transformation, and estimating its parameters. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we propose a convolutional neural network architecture for geometric matching. The architecture is based on three main components that mimic the standard steps of feature extraction, matching and simultaneous inlier detection and model parameter estimation, while being trainable end-to-end. Second, we demonstrate that the network parameters can be trained from synthetically generated imagery without the need for manual annotation and that our matching layer significantly increases generalization capabilities to never seen before images. Finally, we show that the same model can perform both instance-level and category-level matching giving state-of-the-art results on the challenging Proposal Flow dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Rocco_Convolutional_Neural_Network_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ignacio Rocco, Relja Arandjelovic, Josef Sivic
Convolutional Random Walk Networks for Semantic Image Segmentation	Most current semantic segmentation methods rely on fully convolutional networks (FCNs). However, their use of large receptive fields and many pooling layers cause low spatial resolution inside the deep layers. This leads to predictions with poor localization around the boundaries. Prior work has attempted to address this issue by post-processing predictions with CRFs or MRFs. But such models often fail to capture semantic relationships between objects, which causes spatially disjoint predictions. To overcome these problems, recent methods integrated CRFs or MRFs into an FCN framework. The downside of these new models is that they have much higher complexity than traditional FCNs, which renders training and testing more challenging. In this work we introduce a simple, yet effective Convolutional Random Walk Network (RWN) that addresses the issues of poor boundary localization and spatially fragmented predictions with very little increase in model complexity. Our proposed RWN jointly optimizes the objectives of pixelwise affinity and semantic segmentation. It combines these two objectives via a novel random walk layer that enforces consistent spatial grouping in the deep layers of the network. Our RWN is implemented using standard convolution and matrix multiplication. This allows an easy integration into existing FCN frameworks and it enables end-to-end training of the whole network via standard back-propagation. Our implementation of RWN requires just 131 additional parameters compared to the traditional FCNs, and yet it consistently produces an improvement over the FCNs on semantic segmentation and scene labeling.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Bertasius_Convolutional_Random_Walk_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Gedas Bertasius, Lorenzo Torresani, Stella X.

Correlational Gaussian Processes for Cross-Domain Visual Recognition	We present a probabilistic model that captures higher order co-occurrence statistics for joint visual recognition in a collection of images and across multiple domains. More importantly, we predict the structured output across multiple domains by correlating outputs from the multi-classes Gaussian process classifiers in each individual domain. A set of correlational tensors is adopted to model the relationship within a single domain as well as across multiple domains. This renders it possible to explore a high-order relational model instead of using just a set of pairwise relational models. Such tensor relations are based on both the positive and negative co-occurrences of different categories of visual instances across multi-domains. This is in contrast to most previous models where only pair-wise relationships are explored. We conduct experiments on four challenging image collections. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Long_Correlational_Gaussian_Processes_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chengjiang Long, Gang Hua
Counting Everyday Objects in Everyday Scenes	We are interested in counting the number of instances of object classes in natural, everyday images. Previous counting approaches tackle the problem in restricted domains such as counting pedestrians in surveillance videos. Counts can also be estimated from outputs of other vision tasks like object detection. In this work, we build dedicated models for counting designed to tackle the large variance in counts, appearances, and scales of objects found in natural scenes. Our approach is inspired by the phenomenon of subitizing - the ability of humans to make quick assessments of counts given a perceptual signal, for small count values. Given a natural scene, we employ a divide and conquer strategy while incorporating context across the scene to adapt the subitizing idea to counting. Our approach offers consistent improvements over numerous baseline approaches for counting on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and COCO datasets. Subsequently, we study how counting can be used to improve object detection. We then show a proof of concept application of our counting methods to the task of Visual Question Answering, by studying the 'how many?' questions in the VQA and COCO-QA datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chattopadhyay_Counting_Everyday_Objects_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Prithvijit Chattopadhyay, Ramakrishna Vedantam, Ramprasaath R.

Court-Based Volleyball Video Summarization Focusing on Rally Scene	In this paper, we propose a video summarization system for volleyball videos. Our system automatically detects rally scenes as self-consumable video segments and evaluates rally-rank for each rally scene to decide priority. In the priority decision, features representing the contents of the game are necessary; however such features have not been considered in most previous methods. Although several visual features such as the position of a ball and players should be used, acquisition of such features is still non-robust and unreliable in low resolution or low frame rate volleyball videos. Instead, we utilize the court transition information caused by camera operation. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of our rally scene detection and the effectiveness of our rally-rank to reflect viewers' preferences over previous methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w2/html/Itazuri_Court-Based_Volleyball_Video_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Takahiro Itazuri, Tsukasa Fukusato, Shugo Yamaguchi, Shigeo Morishima

Cross-Modality Binary Code Learning via Fusion Similarity Hashing	"Binary code learning has been emerging topic in large-scale cross-modality retrieval recently. It aims to map features from multiple modalities into a common Hamming space, where the cross-modality similarity can be approximated efficiently via Hamming distance. To this end, most existing works learn binary codes directly from data instances in multiple modalities, which preserve both intra- and inter-modal similarities respectively. Few methods consider to preserve the ""fusion similarity"" among multi-modal instances instead, which can explicitly capture their heterogeneous correlation in cross-modality retrieval. In this paper, we propose a hashing scheme, termed Fusion Similarity Hashing (FSH), which explicitly embeds the graph-based fusion similarity across modalities into a common Hamming space. Inspired by the ""fusion by diffusion"", our core idea is to construct an undirected asymmetric graph to model the fusion similarity among different modalities, upon which a graph hashing scheme with alternating optimization is introduced to learn binary codes that embeds such fusion similarity. Quantitative evaluations on three widely used benchmarks, i.e., UCI Handwritten Digit, MIR-Flickr25K and NUS-WIDE, demonstrate that the proposed FSH approach can achieve superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Liu_Cross-Modality_Binary_Code_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hong Liu, Rongrong Ji, Yongjian Wu, Feiyue Huang, Baochang Zhang
Cross-View Image Matching for Geo-Localization in Urban Environments	In this paper, we address the problem of cross-view image geo-localization. Specifically, we aim to estimate the GPS location of a query street view image by finding the matching images in a reference database of geo-tagged bird's eye view images, or vice versa. To this end, we present a new framework for cross-view image geo-localization by taking advantage of the tremendous success of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image classification and object detection. First, we employ the Faster R-CNN to detect buildings in the query and reference images. Next, for each building in the query image, we retrieve the k nearest neighbors from the reference buildings using a Siamese network trained on both positive matching image pairs and negative pairs. To find the correct NN for each query building, we develop an efficient multiple nearest neighbors matching method based on dominant sets. We evaluate the proposed framework on a new dataset that consists of pairs of street view and bird's eye view images. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better geo-localization accuracy than other approaches and is able to generalize to images at unseen locations.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tian_Cross-View_Image_Matching_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yicong Tian, Chen Chen, Mubarak Shah
Crossing Nets: Combining GANs and VAEs With a Shared Latent Space for Hand Pose Estimation	State-of-the-art methods for 3D hand pose estimation from depth images require large amounts of annotated training data. We propose modelling the statistical relationship of 3D hand poses and corresponding depth images using two deep generative models with a shared latent space. By design, our architecture allows for learning from unlabeled image data in a semi-supervised manner. Assuming a one-to-one mapping between a pose and a depth map, any given point in the shared latent space can be projected into both a hand pose or into a corresponding depth map. Regressing the hand pose can then be done by learning a discriminator to estimate the posterior of the latent pose given some depth map. To prevent over-fitting and to better exploit unlabeled depth maps, the generator and discriminator are trained jointly. At each iteration, the generator is updated with the back-propagated gradient from the discriminator to synthesize realistic depth maps of the articulated hand, while the discriminator benefits from an augmented training set of synthesized samples and unlabeled depth maps. The proposed discriminator network architecture is highly efficient and runs at 90fps on the CPU with accuracies comparable or better than state-of-art on 3 publicly available benchmarks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wan_Crossing_Nets_Combining_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chengde Wan, Thomas Probst, Luc Van Gool, Angela Yao
Crowd-11: A Dataset for Fine Grained Crowd Behaviour Analysis	Crowd behaviour analysis is a challenging task in computer vision, mainly due to the high complexity of the interactions between groups and individuals. This task is particularly crucial given the magnitude of manual monitoring required for effective crowd management. Within this context, a key challenge is to conceive a highly generic, fine and context-independent characterisation of crowd behaviours. Since current datasets answer only partially to this problem, a new dataset is generated, with a total of 11 crowd motion patterns and over 6000 video clips with an average length of 100 frames per sequence. We establish the first baseline of crowd characterisation with an extensive evaluation on shallow and deep methods. This characterisation is expected to be useful in multiple crowd analysis circumstances, we present a new deep architecture for crowd characterisation and demonstrate its application in the context of anomaly classification.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w37/html/Dupont_Crowd-11_A_Dataset_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Camille Dupont, Luis Tobias, Bertrand Luvison
Crowdsourcing for Chromosome Segmentation and Deep Classification	Observations of chromosomal segments or translocations during metaphase can indicate structural changes in cell genome, and is often used for diagnostic purposes. Karyotyping of the chromosomes under metaphase is done by characterizing the individual chromosomes in cell spread images. Currently considerable effort and time is spent to manually segment out overlapping chromosomes from cell images, and classifying the segmented chromosomes into one of the 24 types. There exists techniques which automate segmentation and classification of chromosomes with reasonable accuracy, but a human in the loop is often still required due to the criticality of domain. Therefore, we present a method to segment out and classify chromosomes for healthy patients using a combination of crowdsourcing for segmentation, pre-procesing and classification using deep learning. Experimental results are encouraging and promise to significantly reduce the cognitive burden of automatic karyotyping of chromosomes.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w8/html/Sharma_Crowdsourcing_for_Chromosome_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Monika Sharma, Oindrila Saha, Anand Sriraman, Ramya Hebbalaguppe, Lovekesh Vig, Shirish Karande
Curiosity-Driven Exploration by Self-Supervised Prediction	In many real-world scenarios, rewards extrinsic to the agent are extremely sparse, or absent altogether. In such cases, curiosity can serve as an intrinsic reward signal to enable the agent to explore its environment and learn skills that might be useful later in its life. We formulate curiosity as the error in an agent's ability to predict the consequence of its own actions in a visual feature space learned by a self-supervised inverse dynamics model. Our formulation scales to high-dimensional continuous state spaces like images, bypasses the difficulties of directly predicting pixels, and, critically, ignores the aspects of the environment that cannot affect the agent. The proposed approach is evaluated in two environments: VizDoom and Super Mario Bros. Three broad settings are investigated: 1) sparse extrinsic reward; 2) exploration with no extrinsic reward; and 3) generalization to unseen scenarios (e.g. new levels of the same game).	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w5/html/Pathak_Curiosity-Driven_Exploration_by_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Deepak Pathak, Pulkit Agrawal, Alexei A.

DESIRE: Distant Future Prediction in Dynamic Scenes With Interacting Agents	We introduce a Deep Stochastic IOC RNN Encoder-decoder framework, DESIRE, for the task of future predictions of multiple interacting agents in dynamic scenes. DESIRE effectively predicts future locations of objects in multiple scenes by 1) accounting for the multi-modal nature of the future prediction (i.e., given the same context, future may vary), 2) foreseeing the potential future outcomes and make a strategic prediction based on that, and 3) reasoning not only from the past motion history, but also from the scene context as well as the interactions among the agents. DESIRE achieves these in a single end-to-end trainable neural network model, while being computationally efficient. The model first obtains a diverse set of hypothetical future prediction samples employing a conditional variational auto-encoder, which are ranked and refined by the following RNN scoring-regression module. Samples are scored by accounting for accumulated future rewards, which enables better long-term strategic decisions similar to IOC frameworks. An RNN scene context fusion module jointly captures past motion histories, the semantic scene context and interactions among multiple agents. A feedback mechanism iterates over the ranking and refinement to further boost the prediction accuracy. We evaluate our model on two publicly available datasets: KITTI and Stanford Drone Dataset. Our experiments show that the proposed model significantly improves the prediction accuracy compared to other baseline methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lee_DESIRE_Distant_Future_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Namhoon Lee, Wongun Choi, Paul Vernaza, Christopher B.

DOPE: Distributed Optimization for Pairwise Energies	We formulate an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) that systematically distributes the computations of any technique for optimizing pairwise functions, including non-submodular potentials. Such discrete functions are very useful in segmentation and a breadth of other vision problems. Our method decomposes the problem into a large set of small sub-problems, each involving a sub-region of the image domain, which can be solved in parallel. We achieve consistency between the sub-problems through a novel constraint that can be used for a large class of pairwise functions. We give an iterative numerical solution that alternates between solving the sub-problems and updating consistency variables, until convergence. We report comprehensive experiments, which demonstrate the benefit of our general distributed solution in the case of the popular serial algorithm of Boykov and Kolmogorov (BK algorithm) and, also, in the context of non-submodular functions.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Dolz_DOPE_Distributed_Optimization_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jose Dolz, Ismail Ben Ayed, Christian Desrosiers
DSAC - Differentiable RANSAC for Camera Localization	RANSAC is an important algorithm in robust optimization and a central building block for many computer vision applications. In recent years, traditionally hand-crafted pipelines have been replaced by deep learning pipelines, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. However, RANSAC has so far not been used as part of such deep learning pipelines, because its hypothesis selection procedure is non-differentiable. In this work, we present two different ways to overcome this limitation. The most promising approach is inspired by reinforcement learning, namely to replace the deterministic hypothesis selection by a probabilistic selection for which we can derive the expected loss w.r.t. to all learnable parameters. We call this approach DSAC, the differentiable counterpart of RANSAC. We apply DSAC to the problem of camera localization, where deep learning has so far failed to improve on traditional approaches. We demonstrate that by directly minimizing the expected loss of the output camera poses, robustly estimated by RANSAC, we achieve an increase in accuracy. In the future, any deep learning pipeline can use DSAC as a robust optimization component.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Brachmann_DSAC_-_Differentiable_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Eric Brachmann, Alexander Krull, Sebastian Nowozin, Jamie Shotton, Frank Michel, Stefan Gumhold, Carsten Rother
DUST: Dual Union of Spatio-Temporal Subspaces for Monocular Multiple Object 3D Reconstruction	We present an approach to reconstruct the 3D shape of multiple deforming objects from incomplete 2D trajectories acquired by a single camera. Additionally, we simultaneously provide spatial segmentation (i.e., we identify each of the objects in every frame) and temporal clustering (i.e., we split the sequence into primitive actions). This advances existing work, which only tackled the problem for one single object and non-occluded tracks. In order to handle several objects at a time from partial observations, we model point trajectories as a union of spatial and temporal subspaces, and optimize the parameters of both modalities, the non-observed point tracks and the 3D shape via augmented Lagrange multipliers. The algorithm is fully unsupervised and results in a formulation which does not need initialization. We thoroughly validate the method on challenging scenarios with several human subjects performing different activities which involve complex motions and close interaction. We show our approach achieves state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction results, while it also provides spatial and temporal segmentation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Agudo_DUST_Dual_Union_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Antonio Agudo, Francesc Moreno-Noguer
Dataset and Pipeline for Multi-View Light-Field Video	The quantity and diversity of data in Light-Field videos makes this content valuable for many applications such as mixed and augmented reality or post-production in the movie industry. Some of such applications require a large parallax between the different views of the Light-Field, making the multi-view capture a better option than plenoptic cameras. In this paper we propose a dataset and a complete pipeline for Light-Field video. The proposed algorithms are specially tailored to process sparse and wide-baseline multi-view videos captured with a camera rig. Our pipeline includes algorithms such as geometric calibration, color homogenization, view pseudo-rectification and depth estimation. Such elemental algorithms are well known by the state-of-the-art but they must achieve high accuracy to guarantee the success of other algorithms using our data. Along this paper, we publish our Light-Field video dataset that we believe may be of special interest for the community. We provide the original sequences, the calibration parameters and the pseudo-rectified views. Finally, we propose a depth-based rendering algorithm for Dynamic Perspective Rendering.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w27/html/Sabater_Dataset_and_Pipeline_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Neus Sabater, Guillaume Boisson, Benoit Vandame, Paul Kerbiriou, Frederic Babon, Matthieu Hog, Remy Gendrot, Tristan Langlois, Olivier Bureller, Arno Schubert, Valerie Allie
DeLiGAN : Generative Adversarial Networks for Diverse and Limited Data	"A class of recent approaches for generating images, called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), have been used to generate impressively realistic images of objects, bedrooms, handwritten digits and a variety of other image modalities. However, typical GAN-based approaches require large amounts of training data to capture the diversity across the image modality. In this paper, we propose DeLiGAN -- a novel GAN-based architecture for diverse and limited training data scenarios. In our approach, we reparameterize the latent generative space as a mixture model and learn the mixture model's parameters along with those of GAN. This seemingly simple modification to the GAN framework is surprisingly effective and results in models which enable diversity in generated samples although trained with limited data. In our work, we show that DeLiGAN can generate images of handwritten digits, objects and hand-drawn sketches, all using limited amounts of data. To quantitatively characterize intra-class diversity of generated samples, we also introduce a modified version of ""inception-score"", a measure which has been found to correlate well with human assessment of generated samples."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Gurumurthy_DeLiGAN__Generative_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Swaminathan Gurumurthy, Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla, R.

DeMoN: Depth and Motion Network for Learning Monocular Stereo	In this paper we formulate structure from motion as a learning problem. We train a convolutional network end-to-end to compute depth and camera motion from successive, unconstrained image pairs. The architecture is composed of multiple stacked encoder-decoder networks, the core part being an iterative network that is able to improve its own predictions. The network estimates not only depth and motion, but additionally surface normals, optical flow between the images and confidence of the matching. A crucial component of the approach is a training loss based on spatial relative differences. Compared to traditional two-frame structure from motion methods, results are more accurate and more robust. In contrast to the popular depth-from-single-image networks, DeMoN learns the concept of matching and, thus, better generalizes to structures not seen during training.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ummenhofer_DeMoN_Depth_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Benjamin Ummenhofer, Huizhong Zhou, Jonas Uhrig, Nikolaus Mayer, Eddy Ilg, Alexey Dosovitskiy, Thomas Brox
Deceiving Google's Cloud Video Intelligence API Built for Summarizing Videos	"Despite the rapid progress of the techniques for image classification, video annotation has remained a challenging task. Automated video annotation would be a breakthrough technology, enabling users to search within the videos. Recently, Google introduced the Cloud Video Intelligence API for video analysis. As per the website, the system can be used to ""separate signal from noise, by retrieving relevant information at the video, shot or per frame"" level. A demonstration website has been also launched, which allows anyone to select a video for annotation. The API then detects the video labels (objects within the video) as well as shot labels (description of the video events over time). In this paper, we examine the usability of the Google's Cloud Video Intelligence API in adversarial environments. In particular, we investigate whether an adversary can subtly manipulate a video in such a way that the API will return only the adversary-desired labels. For this, we select an image, which is different from the video content, and insert it, periodically and at a very low rate, into the video. We found that if we insert one image every two seconds, the API is deceived into annotating the video as if it only contained the inserted image. Note that the modification to the video is hardly noticeable as, for instance, for a typical frame rate of 25, we insert only one image per 50 video frames. We also found that, by inserting one image per second, all the shot labels returned by the API are related to the inserted image. We perform the experiments on the sample videos provided by the API demonstration website and show that our attack is successful with different videos and images."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w16/html/Poovendran_Deceiving_Googles_Cloud_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hossein Hosseini; Baicen Xiao; Radha Poovendran
Decoding the Deep: Exploring Class Hierarchies of Deep Representations Using Multiresolution Matrix Factorization	The necessity of depth has led to a family of designs referred to as very deep networks (e.g., GoogLeNet has 22 layers). As the depth increases even further, the need for appropriate tools to explore the space of hidden representations becomes paramount. Classical PCA or eigen-spectrum based global approaches do not model the complex inter-class relationships. In this work, we propose a novel decomposition referred to as multiresolution matrix factorization that models hierarchical and compositional structure in symmetric matrices. This new decomposition efficiently infers semantic relationships among deep representations, even when they are not explicitly trained to do so. We show that it is a valuable tool in understanding the landscape of hidden representations, in adapting existing architectures for new tasks and also for designing new architectures using interpretable, human-releatable, class-by-class relationships that we hope the network to learn.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w26/html/Ithapu_Decoding_the_Deep_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Vamsi K.

At each frame, the agent observes a panoramic image and has the knowledge of previously selected viewing angles. The task of the agent is to shift the current viewing angle (i.e. action) to the next preferred one (i.e., goal). We propose to directly learn an online policy of the agent from data. Specifically, we leverage a state-of-the-art object detector to propose a few candidate objects of interest (yellow boxes in Fig. 1). Then, a recurrent neural network is used to select the main object (green dash boxes in Fig. 1). Given the main object and previously selected viewing angles, our method regresses a shift in viewing angle to move to the next one. We use the policy gradient technique to jointly train our pipeline, by minimizing: (1) a regression loss measuring the distance between the selected and ground truth viewing angles, (2) a smoothness loss encouraging smooth transition in viewing angle, and (3) maximizing an expected reward of focusing on a foreground object. To evaluate our method, we built a new 360-Sports video dataset consisting of five sports domains. We trained domain-specific agents and achieved the best performance on viewing angle selection accuracy and users' preference compared to [54] and other baselines."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Hu_Deep_360_Pilot_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hou-Ning Hu, Yen-Chen Lin, Ming-Yu Liu, Hsien-Tzu Cheng, Yung-Ju Chang, Min Sun
Deep Affordance-Grounded Sensorimotor Object Recognition	"It is well-established by cognitive neuroscience that human perception of objects constitutes a complex process, where object appearance information is combined with evidence about the so-called object ""affordances"", namely the types of actions that humans typically perform when interacting with them. This fact has recently motivated the ""sensorimotor"" approach to the challenging task of automatic object recognition, where both information sources are fused to improve robustness. In this work, the aforementioned paradigm is adopted, surpassing current limitations of sensorimotor object recognition research. Specifically, the deep learning paradigm is introduced to the problem for the first time, developing a number of novel neuro-biologically and neuro-physiologically inspired architectures that utilize state-of-the-art neural networks for fusing the available information sources in multiple ways. The proposed methods are evaluated using a large RGB-D corpus, which is specifically collected for the task of sensorimotor object recognition and is made publicly available. Experimental results demonstrate the utility of affordance information to object recognition, achieving an up to 29% relative error reduction by its inclusion."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Thermos_Deep_Affordance-Grounded_Sensorimotor_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Spyridon Thermos, Georgios Th.

Deep Alignment Network: A Convolutional Neural Network for Robust Face Alignment	In this paper, we propose Deep Alignment Network (DAN), a robust face alignment method based on a deep neural network architecture. DAN consists of multiple stages, where each stage improves the locations of the facial landmarks estimated by the previous stage. Our method uses entire face images at all stages, contrary to the recently proposed face alignment methods that rely on local patches. This is possible thanks to the use of landmark heatmaps which provide visual information about landmark locations estimated at the previous stages of the algorithm. The use of entire face images rather than patches allows DAN to handle face images with large variation in head pose and difficult initializations. An extensive evaluation on two publicly available datasets shows that DAN reduces the state-of-the-art failure rate by up to 70%. Our method has also been submitted for evaluation as part of the Menpo challenge.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w33/html/Kowalski_Deep_Alignment_Network_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Marek Kowalski, Jacek Naruniec, Tomasz Trzcinski
Deep Analysis of Facial Behavioral Dynamics	Modelling of facial dynamics, as well as recovering of latent dimensions that correspond to facial dynamics is of paramount importance for many tasks relevant to facial behaviour analysis. Currently, analysis of facial dynamics is performed by applying linear techniques, mainly, on sparse facial tracks. In this, paper we propose the first, to the best of our knowledge, methodology for extracting lowdimensional latent dimensions that correspond to facial dynamics (i.e., motion of facial parts). To this end we develop appropriate unsupervised and supervised deep autoencoder architectures, which are able to extract features that correspond to the facial dynamics. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach in various facial behaviour datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w33/html/Zafeiriou_Deep_Analysis_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Lazaros Zafeiriou, Stefanos Zafeiriou, Maja Pantic
Deep Co-Occurrence Feature Learning for Visual Object Recognition	This paper addresses three issues in integrating part-based representations into convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for object recognition. First, most part-based models rely on a few pre-specified object parts. However, the optimal object parts for recognition often vary from category to category. Second, acquiring training data with part-level annotation is labor-intensive. Third, modeling spatial relationships between parts in CNNs often involves an exhaustive search of part templates over multiple network streams. We tackle the three issues by introducing a new network layer, called co-occurrence layer. It can extend a convolutional layer to encode the co-occurrence between the visual parts detected by the numerous neurons, instead of a few pre-specified parts. To this end, the feature maps serve as both filters and images, and mutual correlation filtering is conducted between them. The co-occurrence layer is end-to-end trainable. The resultant co-occurrence features are rotation- and translation-invariant, and are robust to object deformation. By applying this new layer to the VGG-16 and ResNet-152, we achieve the recognition rates of 83.6% and 85.8% on the Caltech-UCSD bird benchmark, respectively. The source code is available at https://github.com/yafangshih/Deep-COOC.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Shih_Deep_Co-Occurrence_Feature_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ya-Fang Shih, Yang-Ming Yeh, Yen-Yu Lin, Ming-Fang Weng, Yi-Chang Lu, Yung-Yu Chuang
Deep Convolutional Neural Network Using Triplets of Faces, Deep Ensemble, and Score-Level Fusion for Face Recognition	This paper proposes a new face verification method that uses multiple deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and a deep ensemble, that extracts two types of low dimensional but discriminative and high-level abstracted features from each DCNN, then combines them as a descriptor for face verification. Our DCNNs are built from stacked multi-scale convolutional layer blocks to present multi-scale abstraction. To train our DCNNs, we use different resolutions of triplets that consist of reference images, positive images, and negative images, and triplet-based loss function that maximize the ratio of distances between negative pairs and positive pairs and minimize the absolute distances between positive face images. A deep ensemble is generated from features extracted by each DCNN, and used as a descriptor to train the joint Bayesian learning and its transfer learning method. On the LFW, although we use only 198,018 images and only four different types of networks, the proposed method with the joint Bayesian learning and its transfer learning method achieved 98.33% accuracy. In addition to further increase the accuracy, we combine the proposed method and high dimensional LBP based joint Bayesian method, and achieved 99.08% accuracy on the LFW. Therefore, the proposed method helps to improve the accuracy of face verification when training data is insufficient to train DCNNs.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w6/html/Kang_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Bong-Nam Kang, Yonghyun Kim, Daijin Kim
Deep Crisp Boundaries	Edge detection had made significant progress with the help of deep Convolutional Networks (ConvNet). ConvNet based edge detectors approached human level performance on standard benchmarks. We provide a systematical study of these detector outputs, and show that they failed to accurately localize edges, which can be adversarial for tasks that require crisp edge inputs. In addition, we propose a novel refinement architecture to address the challenging problem of learning a crisp edge detector using ConvNet. Our method leverages a top-down backward refinement pathway, and progressively increases the resolution of feature maps to generate crisp edges. Our results achieve promising performance on BSDS500, surpassing human accuracy when using standard criteria, and largely outperforming state-of-the-art methods when using more strict criteria. We further demonstrate the benefit of crisp edge maps for estimating optical flow and generating object proposals.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_Deep_Crisp_Boundaries_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yupei Wang, Xin Zhao, Kaiqi Huang
Deep Cross-Modal Hashing	Due to its low storage cost and fast query speed, cross-modal hashing (CMH) has been widely used for similarity search in multimedia retrieval applications. However, most existing CMH methods are based on hand-crafted features which might not be optimally compatible with the hash-code learning procedure. As a result, existing CMH methods with hand-crafted features may not achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a novel CMH method, called deep cross-modal hashing (DCMH), by integrating feature learning and hash-code learning intothe same framework. DCMH is an end-to-end learning framework with deep neural networks, one for each modality, to perform feature learning from scratch. Experiments on three real datasets with image-text modalities show that DCMH can outperform other baselines to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal retrieval applications.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Jiang_Deep_Cross-Modal_Hashing_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Qing-Yuan Jiang, Wu-Jun Li
Deep Face Deblurring	Blind deblurring consists a long studied task, however the outcomes of generic methods are not effective in real world blurred images. Domain-specific methods for deblurring targeted object categories, frequently outperform their generic counterparts. In this work, we develop such a domain-specific method to tackle deblurring of human faces, henceforth referred to as face deblurring. Studying faces is of tremendous significance in computer vision, however face deblurring has yet to demonstrate some convincing results. This can be partly attributed to the combination of i) poor texture and ii) highly structure shape that yield the contour/gradient priors (that are typically used) sub-optimal. We adopt a learning approach by inserting weak supervision that exploits the well-documented structure of the face. We introduce an efficient framework that allows the generation of a large dataset. We utilised this framework to create 2MF^2, a dataset of over two million frames.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w33/html/Chrysos_Deep_Face_Deblurring_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Grigorios G.

Deep Feature Flow for Video Recognition	Deep convolutional neutral networks have achieved great success on image recognition tasks. Yet, it is non-trivial to transfer the state-of-the-art image recognition networks to videos as per-frame evaluation is too slow and unaffordable. We present deep feature flow, a fast and accurate framework for video recognition. It runs the expensive convolutional sub-network only on sparse key frames and propagates their deep feature maps to other frames via a flow field. It achieves significant speedup as flow computation is relatively fast. The end-to-end training of the whole architecture significantly boosts the recognition accuracy. Deep feature flow is flexible and general. It is validated on two recent large scale video datasets. It makes a large step towards practical video recognition. Code would be released.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhu_Deep_Feature_Flow_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xizhou Zhu, Yuwen Xiong, Jifeng Dai, Lu Yuan, Yichen Wei
Deep Feature Interpolation for Image Content Changes	"We propose Deep Feature Interpolation (DFI), a new data- driven baseline for automatic high-resolution image transformation. As the name suggests, DFI relies only on simple linear interpolation of deep convolutional features from pre-trained convnets. We show that despite its simplicity, DFI can perform high-level semantic transformations like ""make older/younger"", ""make bespectacled"", ""add smile"", among others, surprisingly well--sometimes even matching or outperforming the state-of-the-art. This is particularly unexpected as DFI requires no specialized network architecture or even any deep network to be trained for these tasks. DFI therefore can be used as a new baseline to evaluate more complex algorithms and provides a practical answer to the question of which image transformation tasks are still challenging after the advent of deep learning."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Upchurch_Deep_Feature_Interpolation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Paul Upchurch, Jacob Gardner, Geoff Pleiss, Robert Pless, Noah Snavely, Kavita Bala, Kilian Weinberger
Deep Future Gaze: Gaze Anticipation on Egocentric Videos Using Adversarial Networks	We introduce a new problem of gaze anticipation on egocentric videos. This substantially extends the conventional gaze prediction problem to future frames by no longer confining it on the current frame. To solve this problem, we propose a new generative adversarial neural network based model, Deep Future Gaze (DFG). DFG generates multiple future frames conditioned on the single current frame and anticipates corresponding future gazes in next few seconds. It consists of two networks: generator and discriminator. The generator uses a two-stream spatial temporal convolution architecture (3D-CNN) explicitly untangling the foreground and the background to generate future frames. It then attaches another 3D-CNN for gaze anticipation based on these synthetic frames. The discriminator plays against the generator by differentiating the synthetic frames of the generator from the real frames. Through competition with discriminator, the generator progressively improves quality of the future frames and thus anticipates future gaze better. Experimental results on the publicly available egocentric datasets show that DFG significantly outperforms all well-established baselines. Moreover, we demonstrate that DFG achieves better performance of gaze prediction on current frames than state-of-the-art methods. This is due to benefiting from learning motion discriminative representations in frame generation. We further contribute a new egocentric dataset (OST) in the object search task. DFG also achieves the best performance for this challenging dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Deep_Future_Gaze_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mengmi Zhang, Keng Teck Ma, Joo Hwee Lim, Qi Zhao, Jiashi Feng
Deep Hashing Network for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation	In recent years, deep neural networks have emerged as a dominant machine learning tool for a wide variety of application domains. However, training a deep neural network requires a large amount of labeled data, which is an expensive process in terms of time, labor and human expertise. Domain adaptation or transfer learning algorithms address this challenge by leveraging labeled data in a different, but related source domain, to develop a model for the target domain. Further, the explosive growth of digital data has posed a fundamental challenge concerning its storage and retrieval. Due to its storage and retrieval efficiency, recent years have witnessed a wide application of hashing in a variety of computer vision applications. In this paper, we first introduce a new dataset, Office-Home, to evaluate domain adaptation algorithms. The dataset contains images of a variety of everyday objects from multiple domains. We then propose a novel deep learning framework that can exploit labeled source data and unlabeled target data to learn informative hash codes, to accurately classify unseen target data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research effort to exploit the feature learning capabilities of deep neural networks to learn representative hash codes to address the domain adaptation problem. Our extensive empirical studies on multiple transfer tasks corroborate the usefulness of the framework in learning efficient hash codes which outperform existing competitive baselines for unsupervised domain adaptation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Venkateswara_Deep_Hashing_Network_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hemanth Venkateswara, Jose Eusebio, Shayok Chakraborty, Sethuraman Panchanathan
Deep Heterogeneous Face Recognition Networks Based on Cross-Modal Distillation and an Equitable Distance Metric	In this work we present three methods to improve a deep convolutional neural network approach to near-infrared heterogeneous face recognition. We first present a method to distill extra information from a pre-trained visible face network through the output logits of the network. Next, we put forth an altered contrastive loss function that uses the l_1 norm instead of the l_2 norm as a distance metric. Finally, we propose to improve the initialization network by training it for more iterations. We present the results of experiments of these methods on two widely used near-infrared heterogeneous face recognition datasets and compare them to the state-of-the-art.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w3/html/Reale_Deep_Heterogeneous_Face_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Christopher Reale, Hyungtae Lee, Heesung Kwon
Deep Image Harmonization	Compositing is one of the most common operations in photo editing. To generate realistic composites, the appearances of foreground and background need to be adjusted to make them compatible. Previous approaches to harmonize composites have focused on learning statistical relationships between hand-crafted appearance features of the foreground and background, which is unreliable especially when the contents in the two layers are vastly different. In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep convolutional neural network for image harmonization, which can capture both the context and semantic information of the composite images during harmonization. We also introduce an efficient way to collect large-scale and high-quality training data that can facilitate the training process. Experiments on the synthesized dataset and real composite images show that the proposed network outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tsai_Deep_Image_Harmonization_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yi-Hsuan Tsai, Xiaohui Shen, Zhe Lin, Kalyan Sunkavalli, Xin Lu, Ming-Hsuan Yang
Deep Image Matting	Image matting is a fundamental computer vision problem and has many applications. Previous algorithms have poor performance when an image has similar foreground and background colors or complicated textures. The main reasons are prior methods 1) only use low-level features and 2) lack high-level context. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning based algorithm that can tackle both these problems. Our deep model has two parts. The first part is a deep convolutional encoder-decoder network that takes an image and the corresponding trimap as inputs and predict the alpha matte of the image. The second part is a small convolutional network that refines the alpha matte predictions of the first network to have more accurate alpha values and sharper edges. In addition, we also create a large-scale image matting dataset including 49300 training images and 1000 testing images. We evaluate our algorithm on the image matting benchmark, our testing set, and a wide variety of real images. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over previous methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xu_Deep_Image_Matting_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ning Xu, Brian Price, Scott Cohen, Thomas Huang
Deep Joint Rain Detection and Removal From a Single Image	In this paper, we address a rain removal problem from a single image, even in the presence of heavy rain and rain streak accumulation. Our core ideas lie in our new rain image model and new deep learning architecture. We add a binary map that provides rain streak locations to an existing model, which comprises a rain streak layer and a background layer. We create a model consisting of a component representing rain streak accumulation (where individual streaks cannot be seen, and thus visually similar to mist or fog), and another component representing various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks, which usually happen in heavy rain. Based on the model, we develop a multi-task deep learning architecture that learns the binary rain streak map, the appearance of rain streaks, and the clean background, which is our ultimate output. The additional binary map is critically beneficial, since its loss function can provide additional strong information to the network. To handle rain streak accumulation (again, a phenomenon visually similar to mist or fog) and various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks, we propose a recurrent rain detection and removal network that removes rain streaks and clears up the rain accumulation iteratively and progressively. In each recurrence of our method, a new contextualized dilated network is developed to exploit regional contextual information and to produce better representations for rain detection. The evaluation on real images, particularly on heavy rain, shows the effectiveness of our models and architecture.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yang_Deep_Joint_Rain_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Wenhan Yang, Robby T.

Deep LDA-Pruned Nets for Efficient Facial Gender Classification	Many real-time tasks, such as human-computer interaction, require fast and efficient facial gender classification. Although deep CNN nets have been very effective for a multitude of classification tasks, their high space and time demands make them impractical for personal computers and mobile devices without a powerful GPU. In this paper, we develop a 16-layer, yet lightweight, neural network which boosts efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Our net is pruned from the VGG-16 model starting from the last convolutional (conv) layer where we find neuron activations are highly uncorrelated given the gender. Through Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), we show that this high decorrelation makes it safe to discard directly last conv layer neurons with high within-class variance and low between-class variance. Combined with either Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Bayesian classification, the reduced CNNs are capable of achieving comparable (or even higher) accuracies on the LFW and CelebA datasets than the original net with fully connected layers. On LFW, only four Conv5_3 neurons are able to maintain a comparably high recognition accuracy, which results in a reduction of total network size by a factor of 70X with a 11 fold speedup. Comparisons with a state-of-the-art pruning method (as well as two smaller nets) in terms of accuracy loss and convolutional layers pruning rate are also provided.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w6/html/Tian_Deep_LDA-Pruned_Nets_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Qing Tian, Tal Arbel, James J.

Deep Laplacian Pyramid Networks for Fast and Accurate Super-Resolution	Convolutional neural networks have recently demonstrated high-quality reconstruction for single-image super-resolution. In this paper, we propose the Laplacian Pyramid Super-Resolution Network (LapSRN) to progressively reconstruct the sub-band residuals of high-resolution images. At each pyramid level, our model takes coarse-resolution feature maps as input, predicts the high-frequency residuals, and uses transposed convolutions for upsampling to the finer level. Our method does not require the bicubic interpolation as the pre-processing step and thus dramatically reduces the computational complexity. We train the proposed LapSRN with deep supervision using a robust Charbonnier loss function and achieve high-quality reconstruction. Furthermore, our network generates multi-scale predictions in one feed-forward pass through the progressive reconstruction, thereby facilitates resource-aware applications. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of speed and accuracy.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lai_Deep_Laplacian_Pyramid_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Wei-Sheng Lai, Jia-Bin Huang, Narendra Ahuja, Ming-Hsuan Yang
Deep Learning Human Mind for Automated Visual Classification	What if we could effectively read the mind and transfer human visual capabilities to computer vision methods? In this paper, we aim at addressing this question by developing the first visual object classifier driven by human brain signals. In particular, we employ EEG data evoked by visual object stimuli combined with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to learn a discriminative brain activity manifold of visual categories in a reading the mind effort. Afterward, we transfer the learned capabilities to machines by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based regressor to project images onto the learned manifold, thus allowing machines to employ human brain-based features for automated visual classification. We use a 128-channel EEG with active electrodes to record brain activity of several subjects while looking at images of 40 ImageNet object classes. The proposed RNN-based approach for discriminating object classes using brain signals reaches an average accuracy of about 83%, which greatly outperforms existing methods attempting to learn EEG visual object representations. As for automated object categorization, our human brain-driven approach obtains competitive performance, comparable to those achieved by powerful CNN models and it is also able to generalize over different visual datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Spampinato_Deep_Learning_Human_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Concetto Spampinato, Simone Palazzo, Isaak Kavasidis, Daniela Giordano, Nasim Souly, Mubarak Shah
Deep Learning With Low Precision by Half-Wave Gaussian Quantization	The problem of quantizing the activations of a deep neural network is considered. An examination of the popular binary quantization approach shows that this consists of approximating a classical non-linearity, the hyperbolic tangent, by two functions: a piecewise constant sign function, which is used in feedforward network computations, and a piecewise linear hard tanh function, used in the backpropagation step during network learning. The problem of approximating the widely used ReLU non-linearity is then considered. An half-wave Gaussian quantizer (HWGQ) is proposed for forward approximation and shown to have efficient implementation, by exploiting the statistics of of network activations and batch normalization operations. To overcome the problem of gradient mismatch, due to the use of different forward and backward approximations, several piece-wise backward approximators are then investigated. The implementation of the resulting quantized network, denoted as HWGQ-Net, is shown to achieve much closer performance to full precision networks, such as AlexNet, ResNet, GoogLeNet and VGG-Net, than previously available low-precision networks, with 1-bit binary weights and 2-bit quantized activations.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Cai_Deep_Learning_With_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhaowei Cai, Xiaodong He, Jian Sun, Nuno Vasconcelos
Deep Learning for Domain-Specific Action Recognition in Tennis	Recent progress in sports analytics has been driven by the availability of spatio-temporal and high level data. Video-based action recognition in sports can significantly contribute to these advances. Good progress has been made in the field of action recognition but its application to sports mainly focuses in detecting which sport is being played. In order for action recognition to be useful in sports analytics a finer-grained action classification is needed. For this reason we focus on the fine-grained action recognition in tennis and explore the capabilities of deep neural networks for this task. In our model, videos are represented as sequences of features, extracted using the well-known Inception neural network, trained on an independent dataset. Then a 3-layered LSTM network is trained for the classification. Our main contribution is the proposed neural network architecture that achieves competitive results in the challenging THETIS dataset, comprising videos of tennis actions.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w2/html/Mora_Deep_Learning_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Silvia Vinyes Mora, William J.

Deep Learning of Human Visual Sensitivity in Image Quality Assessment Framework	Since human observers are the ultimate receivers of digital images, image quality metrics should be designed from a human-oriented perspective. Conventionally, a number of full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) methods adopted various computational models of the human visual system (HVS) from psychological vision science research. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional neural networks (CNN) based FR-IQA model, named Deep Image Quality Assessment (DeepQA), where the behavior of the HVS is learned from the underlying data distribution of IQA databases. Different from previous studies, our model seeks the optimal visual weight based on understanding of database information itself without any prior knowledge of the HVS. Through the experiments, we show that the predicted visual sensitivity maps agree with the human subjective opinions. In addition, DeepQA achieves the state-of-the-art prediction accuracy among FR-IQA models.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kim_Deep_Learning_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jongyoo Kim, Sanghoon Lee
Deep Learning on Lie Groups for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition	In recent years, skeleton-based action recognition has become a popular 3D classification problem. State-of-the-art methods typically first represent each motion sequence as a high-dimensional trajectory on a Lie group with an additional dynamic time warping, and then shallowly learn favorable Lie group features. In this paper we incorporate the Lie group structure into a deep network architecture to learn more appropriate Lie group features for 3D action recognition. Within the network structure, we design rotation mapping layers to transform the input Lie group features into desirable ones, which are aligned better in the temporal domain. To reduce the high feature dimensionality, the architecture is equipped with rotation pooling layers for the elements on the Lie group. Furthermore, we propose a logarithm mapping layer to map the resulting manifold data into a tangent space that facilitates the application of regular output layers for the final classification. Evaluations of the proposed network for standard 3D human action recognition datasets clearly demonstrate its superiority over existing shallow Lie group feature learning methods as well as most conventional deep learning methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Huang_Deep_Learning_on_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhiwu Huang, Chengde Wan, Thomas Probst, Luc Van Gool
Deep Learning-Based Vehicle Classification Using an Ensemble of Local Expert and Global Networks	Vehicle classification has been a challenging problem because of pose variations, weather / illumination changes, inter-class similarity and insufficient training dataset. With the help of innovative deep learning algorithms and large scale traffic surveillance dataset, we are able to achieve high performance on vehicle classification. In order to improve performance, we propose an ensemble of global networks and mixture of K local expert networks.

Deep Level Sets for Salient Object Detection	Deep learning has been applied to saliency detection in recent years. The superior performance has proved that deep networks can model the semantic properties of salient objects. Yet it is difficult for a deep network to discriminate pixels belonging to similar receptive fields around the object boundaries, thus deep networks may output maps with blurred saliency and inaccurate boundaries. To tackle such an issue, in this work, we propose a deep Level Set network to produce compact and uniform saliency maps. Our method drives the network to learn a Level Set function for salient objects so it can output more accurate boundaries and compact saliency. Besides, to propagate saliency information among pixels and recover full resolution saliency map, we extend a superpixel-based guided filter to be a layer in the network. The proposed network has a simple structure and is trained end-to-end. During testing, the network can produce saliency maps by efficiently feedforwarding testing images at a speed over 12FPS on GPUs. Evaluations on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Hu_Deep_Level_Sets_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ping Hu, Bing Shuai, Jun Liu, Gang Wang
Deep Local Video Feature for Action Recognition	We investigate the problem of representing an entire video using CNN features for human action recognition. End-to-end learning of CNN/RNNs is currently not possible for whole videos due to GPU memory limitations and so a common practice is to use sampled frames as inputs along with the video labels as supervision. However, the global video labels might not be suitable for all of the temporally local samples as the videos often contain content besides the action of interest. We therefore propose to instead treat the deep networks trained on local inputs as local feature extractors. The local features are then aggregated to form global features which are used to assign video-level labels through a second classification stage. We investigate a number of design choices for this local feature approach. Experimental results on the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets show that a simple maximum pooling on the sparsely sampled local features leads to significant performance improvement.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w14/html/Lan_Deep_Local_Video_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhenzhong Lan, Yi Zhu, Alexander G.

Deep MANTA: A Coarse-To-Fine Many-Task Network for Joint 2D and 3D Vehicle Analysis From Monocular Image	In this paper, we present a novel approach, called Deep MANTA (Deep Many-Tasks), for many-task vehicle analysis from a given image. A robust convolutional network is introduced for simultaneous vehicle detection, part localization, visibility characterization and 3D dimension estimation. Its architecture is based on a new coarse-to-fine object proposal that boosts the vehicle detection. Moreover, the Deep MANTA network is able to localize vehicle parts even if these parts are not visible. In the inference, the network's outputs are used by a real time robust pose estimation algorithm for fine orientation estimation and 3D vehicle localization. We show in experiments that our method outperforms monocular state-of-the-art approaches on vehicle detection, orientation and 3D location tasks on the very challenging KITTI benchmark.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chabot_Deep_MANTA_A_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Florian Chabot, Mohamed Chaouch, Jaonary Rabarisoa, Celine Teuliere, Thierry Chateau
Deep Matching Prior Network: Toward Tighter Multi-Oriented Text Detection	"Detecting incidental scene text is a challenging task because of multi-orientation, perspective distortion, and variation of text size, color and scale. Retrospective research has only focused on using rectangular bounding box or horizontal sliding window to localize text, which may result in redundant background noise, unnecessary overlap or even information loss. To address these issues, we propose a new Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based method, named Deep Matching Prior Network (DMPNet), to detect text with tighter quadrangle. First, we use quadrilateral sliding windows in several specific intermediate convolutional layers to roughly recall the text with higher overlapping area and then a shared Monte-Carlo method is proposed for fast and accurate computing of the polygonal areas. After that, we designed a sequential protocol for relative regression which can exactly predict text with compact quadrangle. Moreover, a auxiliary smooth Ln loss is also proposed for further regressing the position of text, which has better overall performance than L2 loss and smooth L1 loss in terms of robustness and stability. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated on a public word-level, multi-oriented scene text database, ICDAR 2015 Robust Reading Competition Challenge 4 ""Incidental scene text localization"". The performance of our method is evaluated by using F-measure and found to be 70.64%, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art method with F-measure 63.76%."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Liu_Deep_Matching_Prior_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yuliang Liu, Lianwen Jin
Deep Metric Learning via Facility Location	Learning image similarity metrics in an end-to-end fashion with deep networks has demonstrated excellent results on tasks such as clustering and retrieval. However, current methods, all focus on a very local view of the data. In this paper, we propose a new metric learning scheme, based on structured prediction, that is aware of the global structure of the embedding space, and which is designed to optimize a clustering quality metric (NMI). We show state of the art performance on standard datasets, such as CUB200-2011, Cars196, and Stanford online products on NMI and R@K evaluation metrics.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Song_Deep_Metric_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hyun Oh Song, Stefanie Jegelka, Vivek Rathod, Kevin Murphy
Deep Mixture of Linear Inverse Regressions Applied to Head-Pose Estimation	Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have become the state-of-the-art for many classification and regression problems in computer vision. When it comes to regression, approaches such as measuring the Euclidean distance of target and predictions are often employed as output layer. In this paper, we propose the coupling of a Gaussian mixture of linear inverse regressions with a ConvNet, and we describe the methodological foundations and the associated algorithm to jointly train the deep network and the regression function. We test our model on the head-pose estimation problem. In this particular problem, we show that inverse regression outperforms regression models currently used by state-of-the-art computer vision methods. Our method does not require the incorporation of additional data, as it is often proposed in the literature, thus it is able to work well on relatively small training datasets. Finally, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in head-pose estimation using a widely used head-pose dataset. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate inverse regression into deep learning for computer vision applications.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lathuiliere_Deep_Mixture_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Stephane Lathuiliere, Remi Juge, Pablo Mesejo, Rafael Munoz-Salinas, Radu Horaud
Deep Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network for Dynamic Scene Deblurring	Non-uniform blind deblurring for general dynamic scenes is a challenging computer vision problem as blurs arise not only from multiple object motions but also from camera shake, scene depth variation. To remove these complicated motion blurs, conventional energy optimization based methods rely on simple assumptions such that blur kernel is partially uniform or locally linear. Moreover, recent machine learning based methods also depend on synthetic blur datasets generated under these assumptions. This makes conventional deblurring methods fail to remove blurs where blur kernel is difficult to approximate or parameterize (e.g. object motion boundaries). In this work, we propose a multi-scale convolutional neural network that restores sharp images in an end-to-end manner where blur is caused by various sources. Together, we present multi-scale loss function that mimics conventional coarse-to-fine approaches. Furthermore, we propose a new large-scale dataset that provides pairs of realistic blurry image and the corresponding ground truth sharp image that are obtained by a high-speed camera. With the proposed model trained on this dataset, we demonstrate empirically that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in dynamic scene deblurring not only qualitatively, but also quantitatively.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Nah_Deep_Multi-Scale_Convolutional_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Seungjun Nah, Tae Hyun Kim, Kyoung Mu Lee
Deep Multimodal Representation Learning From Temporal Data	In recent years, Deep Learning has been successfully applied to multimodal learning problems, with the aim of learning useful joint representations in data fusion applications. When the available modalities consist of time series data such as video, audio and sensor signals, it becomes imperative to consider their temporal structure during the fusion process. In this paper, we propose the Correlational Recurrent Neural Network (CorrRNN), a novel temporal fusion model for fusing multiple input modalities that are inherently temporal in nature. Key features of our proposed model include: (i) simultaneous learning of the joint representation and temporal dependencies between modalities, (ii) use of multiple loss terms in the objective function, including a maximum correlation loss term to enhance learning of cross-modal information, and (iii) the use of an attention model to dynamically adjust the contribution of different input modalities to the joint representation. We validate our model via experimentation on two different tasks: video- and sensor-based activity classification, and audio-visual speech recognition. We empirically analyze the contributions of different components of the proposed CorrRNN model, and demonstrate its robustness, effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yang_Deep_Multimodal_Representation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xitong Yang, Palghat Ramesh, Radha Chitta, Sriganesh Madhvanath, Edgar A.

Deep Multitask Architecture for Integrated 2D and 3D Human Sensing	We propose a deep multitask architecture for fully automatic 2d and 3d human sensing (DMHS), including recognition and reconstruction, in monocular images. The system computes the figure-ground segmentation, semantically identifies the human body parts at pixel level, and estimates the 2d and 3d pose of the person. The model supports the joint training of all components by means of multi-task losses where early processing stages recursively feed into advanced ones for increasingly complex calculations, accuracy and robustness. The design allows us to tie a complete training protocol, by taking advantage of multiple datasets that would otherwise restrictively cover only some of the model components: complex 2d image data with no body part labeling and without associated 3d ground truth, or complex 3d data with limited 2d background variability. In detailed experiments based on several challenging 2d and 3d datasets (LSP, HumanEva, Human3.6M), we evaluate the sub-structures of the model, the effect of various types of training data in the multitask loss, and demonstrate that state-of-the-art results can be achieved at all processing levels. We also show that in the wild our monocular RGB architecture is perceptually competitive to a state-of-the art (commercial) Kinect system based on RGB-D data.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Popa_Deep_Multitask_Architecture_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Alin-Ionut Popa, Mihai Zanfir, Cristian Sminchisescu
Deep Network Flow for Multi-Object Tracking	Data association problems are an important component of many computer vision applications, with multi-object tracking being one of the most prominent examples. A typical approach to data association involves finding a graph matching or network flow that minimizes a sum of pairwise association costs, which are often either hand-crafted or learned as linear functions of fixed features. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn features for network-flow-based data association via backpropagation, by expressing the optimum of a smoothed network flow problem as a differentiable function of the pairwise association costs. We apply this approach to multi-object tracking with a network flow formulation. Our experiments demonstrate that we are able to successfully learn all cost functions for the association problem in an end-to-end fashion, which outperform hand-crafted costs in all settings. The integration and combination of various sources of inputs becomes easy and the cost functions can be learned entirely from data, alleviating tedious hand-designing of costs.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Schulter_Deep_Network_Flow_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Samuel Schulter, Paul Vernaza, Wongun Choi, Manmohan Chandraker
Deep Outdoor Illumination Estimation	We present a CNN-based technique to estimate high-dynamic range outdoor illumination from a single low dynamic range image. To train the CNN, we leverage a large dataset of outdoor panoramas. We fit a low-dimensional physically-based outdoor illumination model to the skies in these panoramas giving us a compact set of parameters (including sun position, atmospheric conditions, and camera parameters). We extract limited field-of-view images from the panoramas, and train a CNN with this large set of input image--output lighting parameter pairs. Given a test image, this network can be used to infer illumination parameters that can, in turn, be used to reconstruct an outdoor illumination environment map. We demonstrate that our approach allows the recovery of plausible illumination conditions and enables photorealistic virtual object insertion from a single image. An extensive evaluation on both the panorama dataset and captured HDR environment maps shows that our technique significantly outperforms previous solutions to this problem.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Hold-Geoffroy_Deep_Outdoor_Illumination_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yannick Hold-Geoffroy, Kalyan Sunkavalli, Sunil Hadap, Emiliano Gambaretto, Jean-Francois Lalonde
Deep Photo Style Transfer	This paper introduces a deep-learning approach to photographic style transfer that handles a large variety of image content while faithfully transferring the reference style. Our approach builds upon the recent work on painterly transfer that separates style from the content of an image by considering different layers of a neural network. However, as is, this approach is not suitable for photorealistic style transfer. Even when both the input and reference images are photographs, the output still exhibits distortions reminiscent of a painting. Our contribution is to constrain the transformation from the input to the output to be locally affine in colorspace, and to express this constraint as a custom fully differentiable energy term. We show that this approach successfully suppresses distortion and yields satisfying photorealistic style transfers in a broad variety of scenarios, including transfer of the time of day, weather, season, and artistic edits.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Luan_Deep_Photo_Style_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Fujun Luan, Sylvain Paris, Eli Shechtman, Kavita Bala
Deep Pyramidal Residual Networks	Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have shown remarkable performance in image classification tasks in recent years. Generally, deep neural network architectures are stacks consisting of a large number of convolutional layers, and they perform downsampling along the spatial dimension via pooling to reduce memory usage. Concurrently, the feature map dimension (i.e., the number of channels) is sharply increased at downsampling locations, which is essential to ensure effective performance because it increases the diversity of high-level attributes. This also applies to residual networks and is very closely related to their performance. In this research, instead of sharply increasing the feature map dimension at units that perform downsampling, we gradually increase the feature map dimension at all units to involve as many locations as possible. This design, which is discussed in depth together with our new insights, has proven to be an effective means of improving generalization ability. Furthermore, we propose a novel residual unit capable of further improving the classification accuracy with our new network architecture. Experiments on benchmark CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets have shown that our network architecture has superior generalization ability compared to the original residual networks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Han_Deep_Pyramidal_Residual_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Dongyoon Han, Jiwhan Kim, Junmo Kim
Deep Quantization: Encoding Convolutional Activations With Deep Generative Model	Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven highly effective for visual recognition, where learning a universal representation from activations of convolutional layer plays a fundamental problem. In this paper, we present Fisher Vector encoding with Variational Auto-Encoder (FV-VAE), a novel deep architecture that quantizes the local activations of convolutional layer in a deep generative model, by training them in an end-to-end manner. To incorporate FV encoding strategy into deep generative models, we introduce Variational Auto-Encoder model, which steers a variational inference and learning in a neural network which can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient method. Different from the FV characterized by conventional generative models (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Model) which parsimoniously fit a discrete mixture model to data distribution, the proposed FV-VAE is more flexible to represent the natural property of data for better generalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets, i.e., UCF101, ActivityNet, and CUB-200-2011 in the context of video action recognition and fine-grained image classification, respectively. Superior results are reported when compared to state-of-the-art representations. Most remarkably, our proposed FV-VAE achieves to-date the best published accuracy of 94.2% on UCF101.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Qiu_Deep_Quantization_Encoding_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhaofan Qiu, Ting Yao, Tao Mei
Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Image Captioning With Embedding Reward	"Image captioning is a challenging problem owing to the complexity in understanding the image content and diverse ways of describing it in natural language. Recent advances in deep neural networks have substantially improved the performance of this task. Most state-of-the-art approaches follow an encoder-decoder framework, which generates captions using a sequential recurrent prediction model. However, in this paper, we introduce a novel decision-making framework for image captioning. We utilize a ""policy network"" and a ""value network"" to collaboratively generate captions. The policy network serves as a local guidance by providing the confidence of predicting the next word according to the current state. Additionally, the value network serves as a global and lookahead guidance by evaluating all possible extensions of the current state. In essence, it adjusts the goal of predicting the correct words towards the goal of generating captions similar to the ground truth captions. We train both networks using an actor-critic reinforcement learning model, with a novel reward defined by visual-semantic embedding. Extensive experiments and analyses on the Microsoft COCO dataset show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across different evaluation metrics."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ren_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning-Based_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhou Ren, Xiaoyu Wang, Ning Zhang, Xutao Lv, Li-Jia Li
Deep Representation Learning for Human Motion Prediction and Classification	Generative models of 3D human motion are often restricted to a small number of activities and can therefore not generalize well to novel movements or applications. In this work we propose a deep learning framework for human motion capture data that learns a generic representation from a large corpus of motion capture data and generalizes well to new, unseen, motions. Using an encoding-decoding network that learns to predict future 3D poses from the most recent past, we extract a feature representation of human motion. Most work on deep learning for sequence prediction focuses on video and speech. Since skeletal data has a different structure, we present and evaluate different network architectures that make different assumptions about time dependencies and limb correlations. To quantify the learned features, we use the output of different layers for action classification and visualize the receptive fields of the network units. Our method outperforms the recent state of the art in skeletal motion prediction even though these use action specific training data. Our results show that deep feedforward networks, trained from a generic mocap database, can successfully be used for feature extraction from human motion data and that this representation can be used as a foundation for classification and prediction.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Butepage_Deep_Representation_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Judith Butepage, Michael J.

Deep Roots: Improving CNN Efficiency With Hierarchical Filter Groups	We propose a new method for creating computationally efficient and compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using a novel sparse connection structure that resembles a tree root. This allows a significant reduction in computational cost and number of parameters compared to state-of-the-art deep CNNs, without compromising accuracy, by exploiting the sparsity of inter-layer filter dependencies. We validate our approach by using it to train more efficient variants of state-of-the-art CNN architectures, evaluated on the CIFAR10 and ILSVRC datasets. Our results show similar or higher accuracy than the baseline architectures with much less computation, as measured by CPU and GPU timings. For example, for ResNet 50, our model has 40% fewer parameters, 45% fewer floating point operations, and is 31% (12%) faster on a CPU (GPU). For the deeper ResNet 200 our model has 48% fewer parameters and 27% fewer floating point operations, while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy. For GoogLeNet, our model has 7% fewer parameters and is 21% (16%) faster on a CPU (GPU).	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ioannou_Deep_Roots_Improving_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yani Ioannou, Duncan Robertson, Roberto Cipolla, Antonio Criminisi
Deep Self-Taught Learning for Weakly Supervised Object Localization	Most existing weakly supervised localization (WSL) approaches learn detectors by finding positive bounding boxes based on features learned with image-level supervision. However, those features do not contain spatial location related information and usually provide poor-quality positive samples for training a detector. To overcome this issue, we propose a deep self-taught learning approach, which makes the detector learn the object-level features reliable for acquiring tight positive samples and afterwards re-train itself based on them. Consequently, the detector progressively improves its detection ability and localizes more informative positive samples. To implement such self-taught learning, we propose a seed sample acquisition method via image-to-object transferring and dense subgraph discovery to find reliable positive samples for initializing the detector. An online supportive sample harvesting scheme is further proposed to dynamically select the most confident tight positive samples and train the detector in a mutual boosting way. To prevent the detector from being trapped in poor optima due to overfitting, we propose a new relative improvement of predicted CNN scores for guiding the self-taught learning process. Extensive experiments on PASCAL 2007 and 2012 show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts, strongly validating its effectiveness.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Jie_Deep_Self-Taught_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zequn Jie, Yunchao Wei, Xiaojie Jin, Jiashi Feng, Wei Liu
Deep Semantic Feature Matching	Estimating dense visual correspondences between objects with intra-class variation, deformations and background clutter remains a challenging problem. Thanks to the breakthrough of CNNs there are new powerful features available. Despite their easy accessibility and great success, existing semantic flow methods could not significantly benefit from these without extensive additional training. We introduce a novel method for semantic matching with pre-trained CNN features which is based on convolutional feature pyramids and activation guided feature selection. For the final matching we propose a sparse graph matching framework where each salient feature selects among a small subset of nearest neighbors in the target image. To improve our method in the unconstrained setting without bounding box annotations we introduce novel object proposal based matching constraints. Furthermore, we show that the sparse matching can be transformed into a dense correspondence field. Extensive experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing semantic matching methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ufer_Deep_Semantic_Feature_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Nikolai Ufer, Bjorn Ommer
Deep Sequential Context Networks for Action Prediction	This paper proposes efficient and powerful deep networks for action prediction from partially observed videos containing temporally incomplete action executions. Different from after-the-fact action recognition, action prediction task requires action labels to be predicted from these partially observed videos. Our approach exploits abundant sequential context information to enrich the feature representations of partial videos. We reconstruct missing information in the features extracted from partial videos by learning from fully observed action videos. The amount of the information is temporally ordered for the purpose of modeling temporal orderings of action segments. Label information is also used to better separate the learned features of different categories. We develop a new learning formulation that enables efficient model training. Extensive experimental results on UCF101, Sports-1M and BIT datasets demonstrate that our approach remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and is up to 300x faster than these methods. Results also show that actions differ in their prediction characteristics; some actions can be correctly predicted even though only the beginning 10% portion of videos is observed.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kong_Deep_Sequential_Context_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yu Kong, Zhiqiang Tao, Yun Fu
Deep Sketch Hashing: Fast Free-Hand Sketch-Based Image Retrieval	Free-hand sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) is a specific cross-view retrieval task, in which queries are abstract and ambiguous sketches while the retrieval database is formed with natural images. Work in this area mainly focuses on extracting representative and shared features for sketches and natural images. However, these can neither cope well with the geometric distortion between sketches and images nor be feasible for large-scale SBIR due to the heavy continuous-valued distance computation. In this paper, we speed up SBIR by introducing a novel binary coding method, named Deep Sketch Hashing (DSH), where a semi-heterogeneous deep architecture is proposed and incorporated into an end-to-end binary coding framework. Specifically, three convolutional neural networks are utilized to encode free-hand sketches, natural images and, especially, the auxiliary sketch-tokens which are adopted as bridges to mitigate the sketch-image geometric distortion. The learned DSH codes can effectively capture the cross-view similarities as well as the intrinsic semantic correlations between different categories. To the best of our knowledge, DSH is the first hashing work specifically designed for category-level SBIR with an end-to-end deep architecture. The proposed DSH is comprehensively evaluated on two large-scale datasets of TU-Berlin Extension and Sketchy, and the experiments consistently show DSH's superior SBIR accuracies over several state-of-the-art methods, while achieving significantly reduced retrieval time and memory footprint.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Liu_Deep_Sketch_Hashing_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Li Liu, Fumin Shen, Yuming Shen, Xianglong Liu, Ling Shao
Deep Spatial-Temporal Fusion Network for Video-Based Person Re-Identification	In this paper, we propose a novel deep end-to-end network to automatically learn the spatial-temporal fusion features for video-based person re-identification. Specifically, the proposed network consists of CNN and RNN to jointly learn both the spatial and the temporal features of input image sequences. The network is optimized by utilizing the siamese and softmax losses simultaneously to pull the instances of the same person closer and push the instances of different persons apart. Our network is trained on full-body and part-body image sequences respectively to learn complementary representations from holistic and local perspectives. By combining them together, we obtain more discriminative features that are beneficial to person re-identification. Experiments conducted on the PRID-2011, i-LIDS-VIS and MARS datasets show that the proposed method performs favorably against existing approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w17/html/Chen_Deep_Spatial-Temporal_Fusion_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Lin Chen, Hua Yang, Ji Zhu, Qin Zhou, Shuang Wu, Zhiyong Gao
Deep Structured Learning for Facial Action Unit Intensity Estimation	We consider the task of automated estimation of facial expression intensity. This involves estimation of multiple output variables (facial action units --- AUs) that are structurally dependent. Their structure arises from statistically induced co-occurrence patterns of AU intensity levels. Modeling this structure is critical for improving the estimation performance; however, this performance is bounded by the quality of the input features extracted from face images. The goal of this paper is to model these structures and estimate complex feature representations simultaneously by combining conditional random field (CRF) encoded AU dependencies with deep learning. To this end, we propose a novel Copula CNN deep learning approach for modeling multivariate ordinal variables. Our model accounts for ordinal structure in output variables and their non-linear dependencies via copula functions modeled as cliques of a CRF. These are jointly optimized with deep CNN feature encoding layers using a newly introduced balanced batch iterative training algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the task of AU intensity estimation on two benchmark datasets. We show that joint learning of the deep features and the target output structure results in significant performance gains compared to existing structured deep models and deep models for analysis of facial expressions.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Walecki_Deep_Structured_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Robert Walecki, Ognjen (Oggi) Rudovic, Vladimir Pavlovic, Bjoern Schuller, Maja Pantic
Deep Supervision With Shape Concepts for Occlusion-Aware 3D Object Parsing	Monocular 3D object parsing is highly desirable in various scenarios including occlusion reasoning and holistic scene interpretation. We present a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to localize semantic parts in 2D image and 3D space while inferring their visibility states, given a single RGB image. Our key insight is to exploit domain knowledge to regularize the network by deeply supervising its hidden layers, in order to sequentially infer intermediate concepts associated with the final task. To acquire training data in desired quantities with ground truth 3D shape and relevant concepts, we render 3D object CAD models to generate large-scale synthetic data and simulate challenging occlusion configurations between objects. We train the network only on synthetic data and demonstrate state-of-the-art performances on real image benchmarks including an extended version of KITTI, PASCAL VOC, PASCAL3D+ and IKEA for 2D and 3D keypoint localization and instance segmentation. The empirical results substantiate the utility of our deep supervision scheme by demonstrating effective transfer of knowledge from synthetic data to real images, resulting in less overfitting compared to standard end-to-end training.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Li_Deep_Supervision_With_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chi Li, M.

Deep TEN: Texture Encoding Network	We propose a Deep Texture Encoding Network (TEN) with a novel Encoding Layer integrated on top of convolutional layers, which ports the entire dictionary learning and encoding pipeline into a single model. Current methods build from distinct components, using standard encoders with separate off-the-shelf features such as such as SIFT descriptors or pre-trained CNN features for material recognition. Our new approach provides an end-to-end learning framework, where the inherent visual vocabularies are learned directly from the loss function. That is, the features, dictionaries and the encoding representation for the classifier are all learned simultaneously. The representation is orderless and therefore is particularly useful for material and texture recognition. This Encoding Layer generalizes robust residual encoders such as VLAD and Fisher Vectors, and has the property of discarding domain specific information which makes the learned convolutional features easier to transfer. Additionally, joint training using multiple datasets of varied sizes and class labels is supported resulting in increased recognition performance. The experimental results show superior performance as compared to state-of-the-art methods using gold-standard databases such as MINC-2500, Flicker Material Database, KTH-TIPS-2b, and a new ground terrain multiview database. The source code for the complete system will be publicly available upon publication.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Deep_TEN_Texture_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hang Zhang, Jia Xue, Kristin Dana
Deep Temporal Linear Encoding Networks	The CNN-encoding of features from entire videos for the representation of human actions has rarely been addressed. Instead, CNN work has focused on approaches to fuse spatial and temporal networks, but these were typically limited to processing shorter sequences. We present a new video representation, called temporal linear encoding (TLE) and embedded inside of CNNs as a new layer, which captures the appearance and motion throughout entire videos. It encodes this aggregated information into a robust video feature representation, via end-to-end learning. Advantages of TLEs are: (a) they encode the entire video into a compact feature representation, learning the semantics and a discriminative feature space; (b) they are applicable to all kinds of networks like 2D and 3D CNNs for video classification; and (c) they model feature interactions in a more expressive way and without loss of information. We conduct experiments on two challenging human action datasets: HMDB51 and UCF101. The experiments show that TLE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on both datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Diba_Deep_Temporal_Linear_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ali Diba, Vivek Sharma, Luc Van Gool
Deep Unsupervised Similarity Learning Using Partially Ordered Sets	Unsupervised learning of visual similarities is of paramount importance to computer vision, particularly due to lacking training data for fine-grained similarities. Deep learning of similarities is often based on relationships between pairs or triplets of samples. Many of these relations are unreliable and mutually contradicting, implying inconsistencies when trained without supervision information that relates different tuples or triplets to each other. To overcome this problem, we use local estimates of reliable (dis-)similarities to initially group samples into compact surrogate classes and use local partial orders of samples to classes to link classes to each other. Similarity learning is then formulated as a partial ordering task with soft correspondences of all samples to classes. Adopting a strategy of self-supervision, a CNN is trained to optimally represent samples in a mutually consistent manner while updating the classes. The similarity learning and grouping procedure are integrated in a single model and optimized jointly. The proposed unsupervised approach shows competitive performance on detailed pose estimation and object classification.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Bautista_Deep_Unsupervised_Similarity_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Miguel A.

Deep Variation-Structured Reinforcement Learning for Visual Relationship and Attribute Detection	Despite progress in visual perception tasks such as image classification and detection, computers still struggle to understand the interdependency of objects in the scene as a whole, e.g., relations between objects or their attributes. Existing methods often ignore global context cues capturing the interactions among different object instances, and can only recognize a handful of types by exhaustively training individual detectors for all possible relationships. To capture such global interdependency, we propose a deep Variation-structured Reinforcement Learning (VRL) framework to sequentially discover object relationships and attributes in the whole image. First, a directed semantic action graph is built using language priors to provide a rich and compact representation of semantic correlations between object categories, predicates, and attributes. Next, we use a variation-structured traversal over the action graph to construct a small, adaptive action set for each step based on the current state and historical actions. In particular, an ambiguity-aware object mining scheme is used to resolve semantic ambiguity among object categories that the object detector fails to distinguish. We then make sequential predictions using a deep RL framework, incorporating global context cues and semantic embeddings of previously extracted phrases in the state vector. Our experiments on the Visual Relationship Detection (VRD) dataset and the large-scale Visual Genome dataset validate the superiority of VRL, which can achieve significantly better detection results on datasets involving thousands of relationship and attribute types. We also demonstrate that VRL is able to predict unseen types embedded in our action graph by learning correlations on shared graph nodes.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Liang_Deep_Variation-Structured_Reinforcement_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xiaodan Liang, Lisa Lee, Eric P.

Deep Video Deblurring for Hand-Held Cameras	Motion blur from camera shake is a major problem in videos captured by hand-held devices. Unlike single-image deblurring, video-based approaches can take advantage of the abundant information that exists across neighboring frames. As a result the best performing methods rely on the alignment of nearby frames. However, aligning images is a computationally expensive and fragile procedure, and methods that aggregate information must therefore be able to identify which regions have been accurately aligned and which have not, a task that requires high level scene understanding. In this work, we introduce a deep learning solution to video deblurring, where a CNN is trained end-to-end to learn how to accumulate information across frames. To train this network, we collected a dataset of real videos recorded with a high frame rate camera, which we use to generate synthetic motion blur for supervision. We show that the features learned from this dataset extend to deblurring motion blur that arises due to camera shake in a wide range of videos, and compare the quality of results to a number of other baselines.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Su_Deep_Video_Deblurring_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shuochen Su, Mauricio Delbracio, Jue Wang, Guillermo Sapiro, Wolfgang Heidrich, Oliver Wang
Deep View Morphing	"Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been successfully applied to view synthesis problems. However, such CNN-based methods can suffer from lack of texture details, shape distortions, or high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN architecture for view synthesis called ""Deep View Morphing"" that does not suffer from these issues. To synthesize a middle view of two input images, a rectification network first rectifies the two input images. An encoder-decoder network then generates dense correspondences between the rectified images and blending masks to predict the visibility of pixels of the rectified images in the middle view. A view morphing network finally synthesizes the middle view using the dense correspondences and blending masks. We experimentally show the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CNN-based view synthesis method."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ji_Deep_View_Morphing_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Dinghuang Ji, Junghyun Kwon, Max McFarland, Silvio Savarese
Deep Visual-Semantic Quantization for Efficient Image Retrieval	Compact coding has been widely applied to approximate nearest neighbor search for large-scale image retrieval, due to its computation efficiency and retrieval quality. This paper presents a compact coding solution with a focus on the deep learning to quantization approach, which improves retrieval quality by end-to-end representation learning and compact encoding and has already shown the superior performance over the hashing solutions for similarity retrieval. We propose Deep Visual-Semantic Quantization (DVSQ), which is the first approach to learning deep quantization models from labeled image data as well as the semantic information underlying general text domains. The main contribution lies in jointly learning deep visual-semantic embeddings and visual-semantic quantizers using carefully-designed hybrid networks and well-specified loss functions. DVSQ enables efficient and effective image retrieval by supporting maximum inner-product search, which is computed based on learned codebooks with fast distance table lookup. Comprehensive empirical evidence shows that DVSQ can generate compact binary codes and yield state-of-the-art similarity retrieval performance on standard benchmarks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Cao_Deep_Visual-Semantic_Quantization_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yue Cao, Mingsheng Long, Jianmin Wang, Shichen Liu
Deep Watershed Transform for Instance Segmentation	Most contemporary approaches to instance segmentation use complex pipelines involving conditional random fields, recurrent neural networks, object proposals, or template matching schemes. In this paper, we present a simple yet powerful end-to-end convolutional neural network to tackle this task. Our approach combines intuitions from the classical watershed transform and modern deep learning to produce an energy map of the image where object instances are unambiguously represented as energy basins. We then perform a cut at a single energy level to directly yield connected components corresponding to object instances. Our model achieves more than double the performance over the state-of-the-art on the challenging Cityscapes Instance Level Segmentation task.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Bai_Deep_Watershed_Transform_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Min Bai, Raquel Urtasun
Deep Wavelet Prediction for Image Super-Resolution	"Recent advances have seen a surge of deep learning approaches for image super-resolution. Invariably, a network, e.g. a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) or auto-encoder is trained to learn the relationship between low and high-resolution image patches. Recognizing that a wavelet transform provides a ""coarse"" as well as ""detail"" separation of image content, we design a deep CNN to predict the ""missing details"" of wavelet coefficients of the low-resolution images to obtain the Super-Resolution (SR) results, which we name Deep Wavelet Super-Resolution (DWSR). Out network is trained in the wavelet domain with four input and output channels respectively. The input comprises of 4 sub-bands of the low-resolution wavelet coefficients and outputs are residuals (missing details) of 4 sub-bands of high-resolution wavelet coefficients. Wavelet coefficients and wavelet residuals are used as input and outputs of our network to further enhance the sparsity of activation maps. A key benefit of such a design is that it greatly reduces the training burden of learning the network that reconstructs low frequency details. The output prediction is added to the input to form the final SR wavelet coefficients. Then the inverse 2d discrete wavelet transformation is applied to transform the predicted details and generate the SR results. We show that DWSR is computationally simpler and yet produces competitive and often better results than state-of-the-art alternatives."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w12/html/Guo_Deep_Wavelet_Prediction_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tiantong Guo, Hojjat Seyed Mousavi, Tiep Huu Vu, Vishal Monga
DeepNav: Learning to Navigate Large Cities	We present DeepNav, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based algorithm for navigating large cities using locally visible street-view images. The DeepNav agent learns to reach its destination quickly by making the correct navigation decisions at intersections. We collect a large-scale dataset of street-view images organized in a graph where nodes are connected by roads. This dataset contains 10 city graphs and a total of more than 1 million street-view images. We propose 3 supervised learning approaches for the navigation task, and show how A* search in the city graph can be used to generate labels for the images. Our annotation process is fully automated using publicly available mapping services, and requires no human input. We evaluate the proposed DeepNav models on 4 held-out cities for navigating to 5 different types of destinations and show that our algorithms outperform previous work that uses hand-crafted features and Support Vector Regression (SVR).	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Brahmbhatt_DeepNav_Learning_to_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Samarth Brahmbhatt, James Hays
DeepPermNet: Visual Permutation Learning	We present a principled approach to uncover the structure of visual data by solving a novel deep learning task coined visual permutation learning. The goal of this task is to find the permutation that recovers the structure of data from shuffled versions of it. In the case of natural images, this task boils down to recovering the original image from patches shuffled by an unknown permutation matrix. Unfortunately, permutation matrices are discrete, thereby posing difficulties for gradient-based methods. To this end, we resort to a continuous approximation of these matrices using doubly-stochastic matrices which we generate from standard CNN predictions using Sinkhorn iterations. Unrolling these iterations in a Sinkhorn network layer, we propose DeepPermNet, an end-to-end CNN model for this task. The utility of DeepPermNet is demonstrated on two challenging computer vision problems, namely, (i) relative attributes learning and (ii) self-supervised representation learning. Our results show state-of-the-art performance on the Public Figures and OSR benchmarks for (i) and on the classification and segmentation tasks on the PASCAL VOC dataset for (ii).	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Santa_Cruz_DeepPermNet_Visual_Permutation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Rodrigo Santa Cruz, Basura Fernando, Anoop Cherian, Stephen Gould
DeepSpace: Mood-Based Image Texture Generation for Virtual Reality From Music	Affective virtual spaces are of interest for many VR applications in wellbeing, art, education, and entertainment. Creating content for virtual environments is a laborious task involving skills like 3D modeling, texturing, animation, lighting, and programming. One way to facilitate content creation is to automate sub-processes like assigning textures and materials. To this end, we introduce the DeepSpace approach that automatically creates and applies textures to objects in procedurally created 3D scenes. The main novelty of our approach is that it uses music to automatically create kaleidoscopic textures for virtual environments designed to elicit emotional responses in users. Specifically, DeepSpace exploits the modeling power of deep neural networks, which have shown great performance in image generation tasks, to achieve mood-based image generation. Our study results indicate the virtual environments created by DeepSpace elicit positive emotions and achieve high presence scores.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w41/html/Roy_DeepSpace_Mood-Based_Image_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Misha Sra, Prashanth Vijayaraghavan, Ognjen (Oggi) Rudovic, Pattie Maes, Deb Roy
DeepXScope: Segmenting Microscopy Images With a Deep Neural Network	High-speed confocal microscopy has shown great promise to yield insights into plant-fungal interactions by allowing for large volumes of leaf tissue to be imaged at high magnification. Currently, segmentation is performed either manually, which is infeasible for large amounts of data, or by developing separate algorithms to extract individual features within the image data. In this work, we propose the use of a single deep convolutional neural network architecture dubbed DeepXScope for automatically segmenting hyphal networks of the fungal pathogen and cell boundaries and stomata of the host plant. DeepXScope is trained on manually annotated images created for each of these structures. We describe experiments that show each individual structure can be accurately extracted automatically using DeepXScope. We anticipate that plant scientists will be able to use this network to automatically extract multiple structures of interest, and we plan to release our tool to the community.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w8/html/Saponaro_DeepXScope_Segmenting_Microscopy_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Philip Saponaro, Wayne Treible, Abhishek Kolagunda, Timothy Chaya, Jeffrey Caplan, Chandra Kambhamettu, Randall Wisser
Deeply Aggregated Alternating Minimization for Image Restoration	Regularization-based image restoration has remained an active research topic in image processing and computer vision. It often leverages a guidance signal captured in different fields as an additional cue. In this work, we present a general framework for image restoration, called deeply aggregated alternating minimization (DeepAM). We propose to train deep neural network to advance two of the steps in the conventional AM algorithm: proximal mapping and b-continuation. Both steps are learned from a large dataset in an end-to-end manner. The proposed framework enables the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to operate as a regularizer in the AM algorithm. We show that our learned regularizer via deep aggregation outperforms the recent data-driven approaches as well as the nonlocal-based methods. The flexibility and effectiveness of our framework are demonstrated in several restoration tasks, including single image denoising, RGB-NIR restoration, and depth super-resolution.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kim_Deeply_Aggregated_Alternating_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Youngjung Kim, Hyungjoo Jung, Dongbo Min, Kwanghoon Sohn
Deeply Supervised Salient Object Detection With Short Connections	Recent progress on saliency detection is substantial, benefiting mostly from the explosive development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Semantic segmentation and saliency detection algorithms developed lately have been mostly based on Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNs). There is still a large room for improvement over the generic FCN models that do not explicitly deal with the scale-space problem. Holisitcally-Nested Edge Detector (HED) provides a skip-layer structure with deep supervision for edge and boundary detection, but the performance gain of HED on saliency detection is not obvious. In this paper, we propose a new saliency method by introducing short connections to the skip-layer structures within the HED architecture. Our framework provides rich multi-scale feature maps at each layer, a property that is critically needed to perform segment detection. Our method produces state-of-the-art results on 5 widely tested salient object detection benchmarks, with advantages in terms of efficiency (0.08 seconds per image), effectiveness, and simplicity over the existing algorithms.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Hou_Deeply_Supervised_Salient_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Qibin Hou, Ming-Ming Cheng, Xiaowei Hu, Ali Borji, Zhuowen Tu, Philip H.

Delineation of Skin Strata in Reflectance Confocal Microscopy Images With Recurrent Convolutional Networks	Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is an effective, non-invasive pre-screening tool for cancer diagnosis. However, acquiring and reading RCM images requires extensive training and experience, and novice clinicians exhibit high variance in diagnostic accuracy. Consequently, there is a compelling need for quantitative tools to standardize image acquisition and analysis. In this study, we use deep recurrent convolutional neural networks to delineate skin strata in stacks of RCM images collected at consecutive depths. To perform diagnostic analysis, clinicians collect RCM images at 4-5 specific layers in the tissue. Our model automates this process by discriminating between RCM images of different layers. Testing our model on an expert labeled dataset of 504 RCM stacks, we achieve 87.97% classification accuracy, and a 9-fold reduction in the number of anatomically impossible errors compared to the previous state-of-the-art.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w8/html/Bozkurt_Delineation_of_Skin_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Alican Bozkurt, Trevor Gale, Kivanc Kose, Christi Alessi-Fox, Dana H.

Delving Deep Into Coarse-To-Fine Framework for Facial Landmark Localization	In this paper we proposed a 4-stage coarse-to-fine framework to tackle the facial landmark localization problem in-the-wild. In our system, we first predict the landmark key points on a coarse level of granularity, which sets a good initialization for the whole framework. Then we group the key points into several components and refine each component with local patches cropped within them. After that we further refine them separately. Each key point is further refined with multi-scale local patches cropped according to its nearest 3-, 5-, and 7-neighbors respectively. The results are fused by an attention gate network. Since a different key-point configuration is adopted in our labeled dataset, a linear transformation is finally learned with the least square approximation to adapt our predictions to the competition's task.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w33/html/Chen_Delving_Deep_Into_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xi Chen, Erjin Zhou, Yuchen Mo, Jiancheng Liu, Zhimin Cao
Dense Captioning With Joint Inference and Visual Context	Dense captioning is a newly emerging computer vision topic for understanding images with dense language descriptions. The goal is to densely detect visual concepts (e.g., objects, object parts, and interactions between them) from images, labeling each with a short descriptive phrase. We identify two key challenges of dense captioning that need to be properly addressed when tackling the problem. First, dense visual concept annotations in each image are associated with highly overlapping target regions, making accurate localization of each visual concept challenging. Second, the large amount of visual concepts makes it hard to recognize each of them by appearance alone. We propose a new model pipeline based on two novel ideas, joint inference and context fusion, to alleviate these two challenges. We design our model architecture in a methodical manner and thoroughly evaluate the variations in architecture. Our final model, compact and efficient, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on Visual Genome for dense captioning with a relative gain of 73% compared to the previous best algorithm. Qualitative experiments also reveal the semantic capabilities of our model in dense captioning.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yang_Dense_Captioning_With_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Linjie Yang, Kevin Tang, Jianchao Yang, Li-Jia Li
Dense Semantic Labeling of Very-High-Resolution Aerial Imagery and LiDAR With Fully-Convolutional Neural Networks and Higher-Order CRFs	Efficient and effective multisensor fusion techniques are demanded in order to fully exploit two complementary data modalities, e.g aerial optical imagery, and the LiDAR data. Recent efforts have been mostly devoted to exploring how to properly combine both sensor data using pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) at the feature level. In this paper, we propose a decision-level fusion approach with a simpler architecture for the task of dense semantic labeling. Our proposed method first obtains two initial probabilistic labeling results from a fully-convolutional neural network and a simple classifier, e.g. logistic regression exploiting spectral channels and LiDAR data, respectively. These two outcomes are then combined within a higher-order conditional random field (CRF). The CRF inference will estimate the final dense semantic labeling results. The proposed method generates the state-of-the-art semantic labeling results.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w18/html/Liu_Dense_Semantic_Labeling_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yansong Liu, Sankaranarayanan Piramanayagam, Sildomar T.

DenseReg: Fully Convolutional Dense Shape Regression In-The-Wild	In this paper we propose to learn a mapping from image pixels into a dense template grid through a fully convolutional network. We formulate this task as a regression problem and train our network by leveraging upon manually annotated facial landmarks 'in-the-wild'. We use such landmarks to establish a dense correspondence field between a three-dimensional object template and the input image, which then serves as the ground-truth for training our regression system. We show that we can combine ideas from semantic segmentation with regression networks, yielding a highly-accurate `quantized regression' architecture. Our system, called DenseReg, allows us to estimate dense image-to-template correspondences in a fully convolutional manner. As such our network can provide useful correspondence information as a stand-alone system, while when used as an initialization for Statistical Deformable Models we obtain landmark localization results that largely outperform the current state-of-the-art on the challenging 300W benchmark. We thoroughly evaluate our method on a host of facial analysis tasks, and demonstrate its use for other correspondence estimation tasks, such as the human body and the human ear. DenseReg code is made available at http://alpguler.com/DenseReg.html along with supplementary materials.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Guler_DenseReg_Fully_Convolutional_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Riza Alp Guler, George Trigeorgis, Epameinondas Antonakos, Patrick Snape, Stefanos Zafeiriou, Iasonas Kokkinos
Densely Connected Convolutional Networks	Recent work has shown that convolutional networks can be substantially deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain shorter connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections--one between each layer and its subsequent layer--our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR- 10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less memory and computation to achieve high performance.

Depth From Defocus in the Wild	We consider the problem of two-frame depth from defocus in conditions unsuitable for existing methods yet typical of everyday photography: a handheld cellphone camera, a small aperture, a non-stationary scene and sparse surface texture. Our approach combines a global analysis of image content---3D surfaces, deformations, figure-ground relations, textures---with local estimation of joint depth-flow likelihoods in tiny patches. To enable local estimation we (1) derive novel defocus-equalization filters that induce brightness constancy across frames and (2) impose a tight upper bound on defocus blur---just three pixels in radius---through an appropriate choice of the second frame. For global analysis we use a novel piecewise-spline scene representation that can propagate depth and flow across large irregularly-shaped regions. Our experiments show that this combination preserves sharp boundaries and yields good depth and flow maps in the face of significant noise, uncertainty, non-rigidity, and data sparsity.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tang_Depth_From_Defocus_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Huixuan Tang, Scott Cohen, Brian Price, Stephen Schiller, Kiriakos N.

Depth-Stretch: Enhancing Depth Perception Without Depth	A simple and efficient method is presented to enhance the depth perception of an image. The approach termed Depth-Stretch (D-stretch) is a tone mapping operation that is applied to the shading component of the given image. Although re-rendering a scene under geometric transformations typically requires extracting the 3D model of the scene, we show that under very simple assumptions D-stretch can be implemented without 3D reconstruction, while still providing a convincing effect of depth enhancement.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w12/html/Hel-Or_Depth-Stretch_Enhancing_Depth_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hagit Hel-Or, Yacov Hel-Or, Renato Keshet
DeshadowNet: A Multi-Context Embedding Deep Network for Shadow Removal	Shadow removal is a challenging task as it requires the detection/annotation of shadows as well as semantic understanding of the scene. In this paper, we propose an automatic and end-to-end deep neural network (DeshadowNet) to tackle these problems in a unified manner. DeshadowNet is designed with a multi-context architecture, where the output shadow matte is predicted by embedding information from three different perspectives. The first global network extracts shadow features from a global view. Two levels of features are derived from the global network and transferred to two parallel networks. While one extracts the appearance of the input image, the other one involves semantic understanding for final prediction. These two complementary networks generate multi-context features to obtain the shadow matte with fine local details. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we construct the first large scale benchmark with 3088 image pairs. Extensive experiments on two publicly available benchmarks and our large-scale benchmark show that the proposed method performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Qu_DeshadowNet_A_Multi-Context_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Liangqiong Qu, Jiandong Tian, Shengfeng He, Yandong Tang, Rynson W.

Designing Effective Inter-Pixel Information Flow for Natural Image Matting	We present a novel, purely affinity-based natural image matting algorithm. Our method relies on carefully defined pixel-to-pixel connections that enable effective use of information available in the image and the trimap. We control the information flow from the known-opacity regions into the unknown region, as well as within the unknown region itself, by utilizing multiple definitions of pixel affinities. This way we achieve significant improvements on matte quality near challenging regions of the foreground object. Among other forms of information flow, we introduce color-mixture flow, which builds upon local linear embedding and effectively encapsulates the relation between different pixel opacities. Our resulting novel linear system formulation can be solved in closed-form and is robust against several fundamental challenges in natural matting such as holes and remote intricate structures. While our method is primarily designed as a standalone natural matting tool, we show that it can also be used for regularizing mattes obtained by various sampling-based methods. Our evaluation using the public alpha matting benchmark suggests a significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Aksoy_Designing_Effective_Inter-Pixel_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yagiz Aksoy, Tunc Ozan Aydin, Marc Pollefeys
Designing Energy-Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks Using Energy-Aware Pruning	Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are indispensable to state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms. However, they are still rarely deployed on battery-powered mobile devices, such as smartphones and wearable gadgets, where vision algorithms can enable many revolutionary real-world applications. The key limiting factor is the high energy consumption of CNN processing due to its high computational complexity. While there are many previous efforts that try to reduce the CNN model size or the amount of computation, we find that they do not necessarily result in lower energy consumption. Therefore, these targets do not serve as a good metric for energy cost estimation. To close the gap between CNN design and energy consumption optimization, we propose an energy-aware pruning algorithm for CNNs that directly uses the energy consumption of a CNN to guide the pruning process. The energy estimation methodology uses parameters extrapolated from actual hardware measurements. The proposed layer-by-layer pruning algorithm also prunes more aggressively than previously proposed pruning methods by minimizing the error in the output feature maps instead of the filter weights. For each layer, the weights are first pruned and then locally fine-tuned with a closed-form least-square solution to quickly restore the accuracy. After all layers are pruned, the entire network is globally fine-tuned using back-propagation. With the proposed pruning method, the energy consumption of AlexNet and GoogLeNet is reduced by 3.7x and 1.6x, respectively, with less than 1% top-5 accuracy loss. We also show that reducing the number of target classes in AlexNet greatly decreases the number of weights, but has a limited impact on energy consumption.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yang_Designing_Energy-Efficient_Convolutional_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tien-Ju Yang, Yu-Hsin Chen, Vivienne Sze
Designing Illuminant Spectral Power Distributions for Surface Classification	There are many scientific, medical and industrial imaging applications where users have full control of the scene illumination and color reproduction is not the primary objective For example, it is possible to co-design sensors and spectral illumination in order to classify and detect changes in biological tissues, organic and inorganic materials, and object surface properties. In this paper, we propose two different approaches to illuminant spectrum selection for surface classification. In the supervised framework we formulate a biconvex optimization problem where we alternate between optimizing support vector classifier weights and optimal illuminants. We also describe a sparse Principal Component Analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction approach that can be used with unlabeled data. We efficiently solve the non-convex PCA problem using a convex relaxation and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). We compare the classification accuracy of a monochrome imaging sensor with optimized illuminants to the classification accuracy of conventional RGB cameras with natural broadband illumination.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Blasinski_Designing_Illuminant_Spectral_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Henryk Blasinski, Joyce Farrell, Brian Wandell

Detailed, Accurate, Human Shape Estimation From Clothed 3D Scan Sequences	We address the problem of estimating human pose and body shape from 3D scans over time. Reliable estimation of 3D body shape is necessary for many applications including virtual try-on, health monitoring, and avatar creation for virtual reality. Scanning bodies in minimal clothing, however, presents a practical barrier to these applications. We address this problem by estimating body shape under clothing from a sequence of 3D scans. Previous methods that have exploited body models produce smooth shapes lacking personalized details. We contribute a new approach to recover a personalized shape of the person. The estimated shape deviates from a parametric model to fit the 3D scans. We demonstrate the method using high quality 4D data as well as sequences of visual hulls extracted from multi-view images. We also make available BUFF, a new 4D dataset that enables quantitative evaluation (http://buff.is.tue.mpg.de). Our method outperforms the state of the art in both pose estimation and shape estimation, qualitatively and quantitatively.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Detailed_Accurate_Human_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chao Zhang, Sergi Pujades, Michael J.

Detangling People: Individuating Multiple Close People and Their Body Parts via Region Assembly	"Today's person detection methods work best when people are in common upright poses and appear reasonably well spaced out in the image. However, in many real images, that's not what people do. People often appear quite close to each other, e.g., with limbs linked or heads touching, and their poses are often not pedestrian-like. We propose an approach to detangle people in multi-person images. We formulate the task as a region assembly problem. Starting from a large set of overlapping regions from body part semantic segmentation and generic object proposals, our optimization approach reassembles those pieces together into multiple person instances. Since optimal region assembly is a challenging combinatorial problem, we present a Lagrangian relaxation method to accelerate the lower bound estimation, thereby enabling a fast branch and bound solution for the global optimum. As output, our method produces a pixel-level map indicating both 1) the body part labels (arm, leg, torso, and head), and 2) which parts belong to which individual person. Our results on challenging datasets show our method is robust to clutter, occlusion, and complex poses. It outperforms a variety of competing methods, including existing detector CRF methods and region CNN approaches. In addition, we demonstrate its impact on a proxemics recognition task, which demands a precise representation of ""whose body part is where"" in crowded images."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Jiang_Detangling_People_Individuating_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hao Jiang, Kristen Grauman
Detect, Replace, Refine: Deep Structured Prediction for Pixel Wise Labeling	Pixel wise image labeling is an interesting and challenging problem with great significance in the computer vision community. In order for a dense labeling algorithm to be able to achieve accurate and precise results, it has to consider the dependencies that exist in the joint space of both the input and the output variables. An implicit approach for modeling those dependencies is by training a deep neural network that, given as input an initial estimate of the output labels and the input image, it will be able to predict a new refined estimate for the labels. In this context, our work is concerned with what is the optimal architecture for performing the label improvement task. We argue that the prior approaches of either directly predicting new label estimates or predicting residual corrections w.r.t. the initial labels with feed-forward deep network architectures are sub-optimal. Instead, we propose a generic architecture that decomposes the label improvement task to three steps: 1) detecting the initial label estimates that are incorrect, 2) replacing the incorrect labels with new ones, and finally 3) refining the renewed labels by predicting residual corrections w.r.t. them. Furthermore, we explore and compare various other alternative architectures that consist of the aforementioned Detection, Replace, and Refine components. We extensively evaluate the examined architectures in the challenging task of dense disparity estimation (stereo matching) and we report both quantitative and qualitative results on three different datasets. Finally, our dense disparity estimation network that implements the proposed generic architecture, achieves state-of-the-art results in the KITTI 2015 test surpassing prior approaches by a significant margin. We plan to release the Torch code that implements the paper in: https://github.com/gidariss/DRR_struct_pred/ .	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Gidaris_Detect_Replace_Refine_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Spyros Gidaris, Nikos Komodakis
Detecting Masked Faces in the Wild With LLE-CNNs	Detecting masked faces (i.e., faces with occlusions) is a challenging task due to two main reasons: 1)the absence of large datasets of masked faces, and 2)the absence of facial cues from the masked regions. To address these issues, this paper first introduces a dataset with 30,811 Internet images and 35,806 annotated MAsked FAces, which is denoted as MAFA. Different from many previous datasets, each annotated face in MAFA is partially occluded by mask. By analyzing the characteristics of masked faces, we propose LLE-CNNs that detect masked face via three major modules. The proposal module first combines two pre-trained CNNs to extract candidate facial regions from the input image and represent them with high dimensional descriptors. After that, the embedding module turns such descriptors into vectors of weights with respect to the components in pre-trained dictionaries of representative normal faces and non-faces by using locally linear embedding. In this manner, missing facial cues in the masked regions can be largely recovered, and the influences of noisy cues introduced by diversified masks can be greatly alleviated. Finally, the verification module takes the weight vectors as input and identifies real facial regions as well as their accurate positions by jointly performing the classification and regression tasks within unified CNNs. Experimental results on MAFA show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms 6 state-of-the-arts by at least 15.6% in detecting masked faces.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ge_Detecting_Masked_Faces_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shiming Ge, Jia Li, Qiting Ye, Zhao Luo
Detecting Oriented Text in Natural Images by Linking Segments	Most state-of-the-art text detection methods are specific to horizontal Latin text and are not fast enough for real-time applications. We introduce Segment Linking (SegLink), an oriented text detection method. The main idea is to decompose text into two locally detectable elements, namely segments and links. A segment is an oriented box covering a part of a word or text line; A link connects two adjacent segments, indicating that they belong to the same word or text line. Both elements are detected densely at multiple scales by an end-to-end trained, fully-convolutional neural network. Final detections are produced by combining segments connected by links. Compared with previous methods, SegLink improves along the dimensions of accuracy, speed, and ease of training. It achieves an f-measure of 75.0% on the standard ICDAR 2015 Incidental (Challenge 4) benchmark, outperforming the previous best by a large margin. It runs at over 20 FPS on 512x512 images. Moreover, without modification, SegLink is able to detect long lines of non-Latin text, such as Chinese.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Shi_Detecting_Oriented_Text_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Baoguang Shi, Xiang Bai, Serge Belongie
Detecting Visual Relationships With Deep Relational Networks	"Relationships among objects play a crucial role in image understanding. Despite the great success of deep learning techniques in recognizing individual objects, reasoning about the relationships among objects remains a challenging task. Previous methods often treat this as a classification problem, considering each type of relationship (e.g. ""ride"") or each distinct visual phrase (e.g. ""person- ride-horse"") as a category. Such approaches are faced with significant difficulties caused by the high diversity of visual appearance for each kind of relationships or the large number of distinct visual phrases. We propose an integrated framework to tackle this problem. At the heart of this framework is the Deep Relational Network, a novel formulation designed specifically for exploiting the statistical dependencies between objects and their relationships. On two large data sets, the proposed method achieves substantial improvement over state-of-the-art."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Dai_Detecting_Visual_Relationships_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Bo Dai, Yuqi Zhang, Dahua Lin
Detecting and Grouping Identical Objects for Region Proposal and Classification	Often multiple instances of an object occur in the same scene, for example in a warehouse. Unsupervised multi-instance object discovery algorithms are able to detect and identify such objects. We use such an algorithm to provide object proposals to a convolutional neural network (CNN) based classifier. This results in fewer regions to evaluate, compared to traditional region proposal algorithms. Additionally, it enables using the joint probability of multiple instances of an object, resulting in improved classification accuracy. The proposed technique can also split a single class into multiple sub-classes corresponding to the different object types, enabling hierarchical classification.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w5/html/Abbeloos_Detecting_and_Grouping_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Wim Abbeloos, Sergio Caccamo, Esra Ataer-Cansizoglu, Yuichi Taguchi, Chen Feng, Teng-Yok Lee
Detection and Localization of Image Forgeries Using Resampling Features and Deep Learning	Resampling is an important signature of manipulated images. In this paper, we propose two methods to detect and localize image manipulations based on a combination of resampling features and deep learning. In the first method, the Radon transform of resampling features are computed on overlapping image patches. Deep learning classifiers and a Gaussian conditional random field model are then used to create a heatmap. Tampered regions are located using a Random Walker segmentation method. In the second method, resampling features computed on overlapping image patches are passed through a Long short-term memory (LSTM) based network for classification and localization. We compare the performance of detection/localization of both these methods. Our experimental results show that both techniques are effective in detecting and localizing digital image forgeries.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w28/html/Peterson_Detection_and_Localization_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jason Bunk; Jawadul H.

Detection of Metadata Tampering Through Discrepancy Between Image Content and Metadata Using Multi-Task Deep Learning	Image content or metadata editing software availability and ease of use has resulted in a high demand for automatic image tamper detection algorithms. Most previous work has focused on detection of tampered image content, whereas we develop techniques to detect metadata tampering in outdoor images using sun altitude angle and other meteorological information like temperature, humidity and weather, which can be observed in most outdoor image scenes. To train and evaluate our technique, we create a large dataset of outdoor images labeled with sun altitude angle and other meteorological data (AMOS+M2), which to our knowledge, is the largest publicly available dataset of its kind. Using this dataset, we train separate regression models for sun altitude angle, temperature and humidity and a classification model for weather to detect any discrepancy between image content and its metadata. Finally, a joint multi-task network for these four features shows a relative improvement of 15.5% compared to each of them individually. We include a detailed analysis for using these networks to detect various types of modification to location and time information in image metadata.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w28/html/Davis_Detection_of_Metadata_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Bor-Chun Chen; Pallabi Ghosh; Vlad I.

Diagnostic Mechanism and Robustness of Safety Relevant Automotive Deep Convolutional Networks	In this paper we investigate functional safety aspects for a road labeling application, a common task in the autonomous driving algorithmic stack. We introduce computationally light safety checks that reduce the error space significantly, train a CNN on the Cityscape dataset that reaches 93% mean IU and use Monte Carlo simulations to assess the impact of single event upset random hardware faults. The results show that the networks based on convolution and ReLU have some intrinsic robustness and that together with additional constraints strong function safety claims can be made. We compare also the diagnostic coverage between floating point and fixed point implementation of CNNs and summarize key safety features needed to achieve a high diagnostic coverage.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w4/html/Krutsch_Diagnostic_Mechanism_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Robert Krutsch, Rolf Schlagenhaft
Differential Angular Imaging for Material Recognition	"Material recognition for real-world outdoor surfaces has become increasingly important for computer vision to support its operation ""in the wild."" Computational surface modeling that underlies material recognition has transitioned from reflectance modeling using in-lab controlled radiometric measurements to image-based representations based on internet-mined images of materials captured in the scene. We propose to take a middle-ground approach for material recognition that takes advantage of both rich radiometric cues and flexible image capture. We realize this by developing a framework for differential angular imaging, where small angular variations in image capture provide an enhanced appearance representation and significant recognition improvement. We build a large-scale material database, Ground Terrain in Outdoor Scenes (GTOS) database, geared towards real use for autonomous agents. The database consists of over 30,000 images covering 40 classes of outdoor ground terrain under varying weather and lighting conditions. We develop a novel approach for material recognition called a Differential An- gular Imaging Network (DAIN) to fully leverage this large dataset. With this novel network architecture, we extract characteristics of materials encoded in the angular and spatial gradients of their appearance. Our results show that DAIN achieves recognition performance that surpasses single view or coarsely quantized multiview images. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of differential angular imaging as a means for flexible, in-place material recognition."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xue_Differential_Angular_Imaging_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jia Xue, Hang Zhang, Kristin Dana, Ko Nishino
Dilated Residual Networks	Convolutional networks for image classification progressively reduce resolution until the image is represented by tiny feature maps in which the spatial structure of the scene is no longer discernible. Such loss of spatial acuity can limit image classification accuracy and complicate the transfer of the model to downstream applications that require detailed scene understanding. These problems can be alleviated by dilation, which increases the resolution of output feature maps without reducing the receptive field of individual neurons. We show that dilated residual networks (DRNs) outperform their non-dilated counterparts in image classification without increasing the model's depth or complexity. We then study gridding artifacts introduced by dilation, develop an approach to removing these artifacts (`degridding'), and show that this further increases the performance of DRNs. In addition, we show that the accuracy advantage of DRNs is further magnified in downstream applications such as object localization and semantic segmentation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yu_Dilated_Residual_Networks_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Fisher Yu, Vladlen Koltun, Thomas Funkhouser
Direct Photometric Alignment by Mesh Deformation	The choice of motion models is vital in applications like image/video stitching and video stabilization. Conventional methods explored different approaches ranging from simple global parametric models to complex per-pixel optical flow. Mesh-based warping methods achieve a good balance between computational complexity and model flexibility. However, they typically require high quality feature correspondences and suffer from mismatches and low-textured image content. In this paper, we propose a mesh-based photometric alignment method that minimizes pixel intensity difference instead of Euclidean distance of known feature correspondences. The proposed method combines the superior performance of dense photometric alignment with the efficiency of mesh-based image warping. It achieves better global alignment quality than the feature-based counterpart in textured images, and more importantly, it is also robust to low-textured image content. Abundant experiments show that our method can handle a variety of images and videos, and outperforms representative state-of-the-art methods in both image stitching and video stabilization tasks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lin_Direct_Photometric_Alignment_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Kaimo Lin, Nianjuan Jiang, Shuaicheng Liu, Loong-Fah Cheong, Minh Do, Jiangbo Lu
Discover and Learn New Objects From Documentaries	Despite the remarkable progress in recent years, detecting objects in a new context remains a challenging task. Detectors learned from a public dataset can only work with a fixed list of categories, while training from scratch usually requires a large amount of training data with detailed annotations. This work aims to explore a novel approach -- learning object detectors from documentary films in a weakly supervised manner. This is inspired by the observation that documentaries often provide dedicated exposition of certain object categories, where visual presentations are aligned with subtitles. We believe that object detectors can be learned from such a rich source of information. Towards this goal, we develop a joint probabilistic framework, where individual pieces of information, including video frames and subtitles, are brought together via both visual and linguistic links. On top of this formulation, we further derive a weakly supervised learning algorithm, where object model learning and training set mining are unified in an optimization procedure. Experimental results on a real world dataset demonstrate that this is an effective approach to learning new object detectors.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chen_Discover_and_Learn_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Kai Chen, Hang Song, Chen Change Loy, Dahua Lin
Discovering Causal Signals in Images	"This paper establishes the existence of observable footprints that reveal the ""causal dispositions"" of the object categories appearing in collections of images. We achieve this goal in two steps. First, we take a learning approach to observational causal discovery, and build a classifier that achieves state-of-the-art performance on finding the causal direction between pairs of random variables, given samples from their joint distribution. Second, we use our causal direction classifier to effectively distinguish between features of objects and features of their contexts in collections of static images. Our experiments demonstrate the existence of a relation between the direction of causality and the difference between objects and their contexts, and by the same token, the existence of observable signals that reveal the causal dispositions of objects."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lopez-Paz_Discovering_Causal_Signals_CVPR_2017_paper.html	David Lopez-Paz, Robert Nishihara, Soumith Chintala, Bernhard Scholkopf, Leon Bottou
Discretely Coding Semantic Rank Orders for Supervised Image Hashing	Learning to hash has been recognized to accomplish highly efficient storage and retrieval for large-scale visual data. Particularly, ranking-based hashing techniques have recently attracted broad research attention because ranking accuracy among the retrieved data is well explored and their objective is more applicable to realistic search tasks. However, directly optimizing discrete hash codes without continuous-relaxations on a nonlinear ranking objective is infeasible by either traditional optimization methods or even recent discrete hashing algorithms. To address this challenging issue, in this paper, we introduce a novel supervised hashing method, dubbed Discrete Semantic Ranking Hashing (DSeRH), which aims to directly embed semantic rank orders into binary codes. In DSeRH, a generalized Adaptive Discrete Minimization (ADM) approach is proposed to discretely optimize binary codes with the quadratic nonlinear ranking objective in an iterative manner and is guaranteed to converge quickly. Additionally, instead of using 0/1 independent labels to form rank orders as in previous works, we generate the listwise rank orders from the high-level semantic word embeddings which can quantitatively capture the intrinsic correlation between different categories. We evaluate our DSeRH, coupled with both linear and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) hash functions, on three image datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10, SUN397 and ImageNet100, and the results manifest that DSeRH can outperform the state-of-the-art ranking-based hashing methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Liu_Discretely_Coding_Semantic_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Li Liu, Ling Shao, Fumin Shen, Mengyang Yu
Discriminative Bimodal Networks for Visual Localization and Detection With Natural Language Queries	Associating image regions with text queries has been recently explored as a new way to bridge visual and linguistic representations. A few pioneering approaches have been proposed based on recurrent neural language models trained generatively (e.g., generating captions), but achieving somewhat limited localization accuracy. To better address natural-language-based visual entity localization, we propose a discriminative approach. We formulate a discriminative bimodal neural network (DBNet), which can be trained by a classifier with extensive use of negative samples. Our training objective encourages better localization on single images, incorporates text phrases in a broad range, and properly pairs image regions with text phrases into positive and negative examples. Experiments on the Visual Genome dataset demonstrate the proposed DBNet significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods both for localization on single images and for detection on multiple images. We we also establish an evaluation protocol for natural-language visual detection.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Discriminative_Bimodal_Networks_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yuting Zhang, Luyao Yuan, Yijie Guo, Zhiyuan He, I-An Huang, Honglak Lee
Discriminative Correlation Filter With Channel and Spatial Reliability	Short-term tracking is an open and challenging problem for which discriminative correlation filters (DCF) have shown excellent performance. We introduce the channel and spatial reliability concepts to DCF tracking and provide a novel learning algorithm for its efficient and seamless integration in the filter update and the tracking process. The spatial reliability map adjusts the filter support to the part of the object suitable for tracking. This allows tracking of non-rectangular objects as well as extending the search region. Channel reliability reflects the quality of the learned filter and it is used as a feature weighting coefficient in localization. Experimentally, with only two simple standard features, HOGs and Colornames, the novel CSR-DCF method -- DCF with Channel and Spatial Reliability -- achieves state-of-the-art results on VOT 2016, VOT 2015 and OTB. The CSR-DCF runs in real-time on a CPU.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lukezic_Discriminative_Correlation_Filter_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Alan Lukezic, Tomas Vojir, Luka Cehovin Zajc, Jiri Matas, Matej Kristan
Discriminative Covariance Oriented Representation Learning for Face Recognition With Image Sets	For face recognition with image sets, while most existing works mainly focus on building robust set models with hand-crafted feature, it remains a research gap to learn better image representations which can closely match the subsequent image set modeling and classification. Taking sample covariance matrix as set model in the light of its recent promising success, we present a Discriminative Covariance oriented Representation Learning (DCRL) framework to bridge the above gap. The framework constructs a feature learning network (e.g. a CNN) to project the face images into a target representation space, and the network is trained towards the goal that the set covariance matrix calculated in the target space has maximum discriminative ability. To encode the discriminative ability of set covariance matrices, we elaborately design two different loss functions, which respectively lead to two different representation learning schemes, i.e., the Graph Embedding scheme and the Softmax Regression scheme. Both schemes optimize the whole network containing both image representation mapping and set model classification in a joint learning manner. The proposed method is extensively validated on three challenging and large scale databases for the task of face recognition with image sets, i.e., YouTube Celebrities, YouTube Face DB and Point-and-Shoot Challenge.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_Discriminative_Covariance_Oriented_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Wen Wang, Ruiping Wang, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen
Discriminative Optimization: Theory and Applications to Point Cloud Registration	Many computer vision problems are formulated as the optimization of a cost function. This approach faces two main challenges: (1) designing a cost function with a local optimum at an acceptable solution, and (2) developing an efficient numerical method to search for one (or multiple) of these local optima. While designing such functions is feasible in the noiseless case, the stability and location of local optima are mostly unknown under noise, occlusion, or missing data. In practice, this can result in undesirable local optima or not having a local optimum in the expected place. On the other hand, numerical optimization algorithms in high-dimensional spaces are typically local and often rely on expensive first or second order information to guide the search. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Discriminative Optimization (DO), a method that learns search directions from data without the need of a cost function. Specifically, DO explicitly learns a sequence of updates in the search space that leads to stationary points that correspond to desired solutions. We provide a formal analysis of DO and illustrate its benefits in the problem of 2D and 3D point cloud registration both in synthetic and range-scan data. We show that DO outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin in terms of accuracy, robustness to perturbations, and computational efficiency.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Vongkulbhisal_Discriminative_Optimization_Theory_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jayakorn Vongkulbhisal, Fernando De la Torre, Joao P.

Disentangled Representation Learning GAN for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition	The large pose discrepancy between two face images is one of the key challenges in face recognition. Conventional approaches for pose-invariant face recognition either perform face frontalization on, or learn a pose-invariant representation from, a non-frontal face image. We argue that it is more desirable to perform both tasks jointly to allow them to leverage each other. To this end, this paper proposes Disentangled Representation learning-Generative Adversarial Network (DR-GAN) with three distinct novelties. First, the encoder-decoder structure of the generator allows DR-GAN to learn a generative and discriminative representation, in addition to image synthesis. Second, this representation is explicitly disentangled from other face variations such as pose, through the pose code provided to the decoder and pose estimation in the discriminator. Third, DR-GAN can take one or multiple images as the input, and generate one unified representation along with an arbitrary number of synthetic images. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation on both controlled and in-the-wild databases demonstrate the superiority of DR-GAN over the state of the art.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tran_Disentangled_Representation_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Luan Tran, Xi Yin, Xiaoming Liu
Distinguishing the Indistinguishable: Exploring Structural Ambiguities via Geodesic Context	A perennial problem in structure from motion (SfM) is visual ambiguity posed by repetitive structures. Recent disambiguating algorithms infer ambiguities mainly via explicit background context, thus face limitations in highly ambiguous scenes which are visually indistinguishable. Instead of analyzing local visual information, we propose a novel algorithm for SfM disambiguation that explores the global topology as encoded in photo collections. An important adaptation of this work is to approximate the available imagery using a manifold of viewpoints. We note that, while ambiguous images appear deceptively similar in appearance, they are actually located far apart on geodesics. We establish the manifold by adaptively identifying cameras with adjacent viewpoint, and detect ambiguities via a new measure, geodesic consistency. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach on a range of complex ambiguity datasets, even including the challenging scenes without background conflicts.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yan_Distinguishing_the_Indistinguishable_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Qingan Yan, Long Yang, Ling Zhang, Chunxia Xiao
Diverse Image Annotation	In this work we study the task of image annotation, of which the goal is to describe an image using a few tags. Instead of predicting the full list of tags, here we target for providing a short list of tags under a limited number (e.g., 3), to cover as much information as possible of the image. The tags in such a short list should be representative and diverse. It means they are required to be not only corresponding to the contents of the image, but also be different to each other. To this end, we treat the image annotation as a subset selection problem based on the conditional determinantal point process (DPP) model, which formulates the representation and diversity jointly. We further explore the semantic hierarchy and synonyms among the candidate tags, and require that two tags in a semantic hierarchy or in a pair of synonyms should not be selected simultaneously. This requirement is then embedded into the sampling algorithm according to the learned conditional DPP model. Besides, we find that traditional metrics for image annotation (e.g., precision, recall and F1 score) only consider the representation, but ignore the diversity. Thus we propose new metrics to evaluate the quality of the selected subset (i.e., the tag list), based on the semantic hierarchy and synonyms. Human study through Amazon Mechanical Turk verifies that the proposed metrics are more close to the human's judgment than traditional metrics. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed method can produce more representative and diverse tags, compared with existing image annotation methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wu_Diverse_Image_Annotation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Baoyuan Wu, Fan Jia, Wei Liu, Bernard Ghanem
Diversified Texture Synthesis With Feed-Forward Networks	Recent progresses on deep discriminative and generative modeling have shown promising results on texture synthesis. However, existing feed-forward based methods trade off generality for efficiency, which suffer from many issues, such as shortage of generality (i.e., build one network per texture), lack of diversity (i.e., always produce visually identical output) and suboptimality (i.e., generate less satisfying visual effects). In this work, we focus on solving these issues for improved texture synthesis. We propose a deep generative feed-forward network which enables efficient synthesis of multiple textures within one single network and meaningful interpolation between them. Meanwhile, a suite of important techniques are introduced to achieve better convergence and diversity. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and techniques for synthesizing a large number of textures and show its applications with the stylization.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Li_Diversified_Texture_Synthesis_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yijun Li, Chen Fang, Jimei Yang, Zhaowen Wang, Xin Lu, Ming-Hsuan Yang
Domain Adaptation by Mixture of Alignments of Second- or Higher-Order Scatter Tensors	In this paper, we propose an approach to the domain adaptation, dubbed Second- or Higher-order Transfer of Knowledge (So-HoT), based on the mixture of alignments of second- or higher-order scatter statistics between the source and target domains. The human ability to learn from few labeled samples is a recurring motivation in the literature for domain adaptation. Towards this end, we investigate the supervised target scenario for which few labeled target training samples per category exist. Specifically, we utilize two CNN streams: the source and target networks fused at the classifier level. Features from the fully connected layers fc7 of each network are used to compute second- or even higher-order scatter tensors; one per network stream per class. As the source and target distributions are somewhat different despite being related, we align the scatters of the two network streams of the same class (within-class scatters) to a desired degree with our bespoke loss while maintaining good separation of the between-class scatters. We train the entire network in end-to-end fashion. We provide evaluations on the standard Office benchmark (visual domains) and RGB-D combined with Caltech256 (depth-to-rgb transfer). We attain state-of-the-art results.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Koniusz_Domain_Adaptation_by_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Piotr Koniusz, Yusuf Tas, Fatih Porikli
DriveAHead - A Large-Scale Driver Head Pose Dataset	Head pose monitoring is an important task for driver assistance systems, since it is a key indicator for human attention and behavior. However, current head pose datasets either lack complexity or do not adequately represent the conditions that occur while driving. Therefore, we introduce DriveAHead, a novel dataset designed to develop and evaluate head pose monitoring algorithms in real driving conditions. We provide frame-by-frame head pose labels obtained from a motion-capture system, as well as annotations about occlusions of the driver's face. To the best of our knowledge, DriveAHead is the largest publicly available driver head pose dataset, and also the only one that provides 2D and 3D data aligned at the pixel level using the Kinect v2. Existing performance metrics are based on the mean error without any consideration of the bias towards one position or another. Here, we suggest a new performance metric, named Balanced Mean Angular Error, that addresses the bias towards the forward looking position existing in driving datasets. Finally, we present the Head Pose Network, a deep learning model that achieves better performance than current state-of-the-art algorithms, and we analyze its performance when using our dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w13/html/Schwarz_DriveAHead_-_A_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Anke Schwarz, Monica Haurilet, Manuel Martinez, Rainer Stiefelhagen
Dual Attention Networks for Multimodal Reasoning and Matching	We propose Dual Attention Networks (DANs) which jointly leverage visual and textual attention mechanisms to capture fine-grained interplay between vision and language. DANs attend to specific regions in images and words in text through multiple steps and gather essential information from both modalities. Based on this framework, we introduce two types of DANs for multimodal reasoning and matching, respectively. The reasoning model allows visual and textual attentions to steer each other during collaborative inference, which is useful for tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). In addition, the matching model exploits the two attention mechanisms to estimate the similarity between images and sentences by focusing on their shared semantics. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DANs in combining vision and language, achieving the state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks for VQA and image-text matching.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Nam_Dual_Attention_Networks_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hyeonseob Nam, Jung-Woo Ha, Jeonghee Kim
DukeMTMC4ReID: A Large-Scale Multi-Camera Person Re-Identification Dataset	In the past decade, research in person re-identification (re-id) has exploded due to its broad use in security and surveillance applications. Issues such as inter-camera viewpoint, illumination and pose variations make it an extremely difficult problem. Consequently, many algorithms have been proposed to tackle these issues. To validate the efficacy of re-id algorithms, numerous benchmarking datasets have been constructed. While early datasets contained relatively few identities and images, several large-scale datasets have recently been proposed, motivated by data-driven machine learning. In this paper, we introduce a new large-scale real-world re-id dataset, DukeMTMC4ReID, using 8 disjoint surveillance camera views covering parts of the Duke University campus. The dataset was created from the recently proposed fully annotated multi-target multi-camera tracking dataset DukeMTMC. A benchmark summarizing extensive experiments with many combinations of existing re-id algorithms on this dataset is also provided for an up-to-date performance analysis.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w17/html/Gou_DukeMTMC4ReID_A_Large-Scale_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mengran Gou, Srikrishna Karanam, Wenqian Liu, Octavia Camps, Richard J.

DyadGAN: Generating Facial Expressions in Dyadic Interactions	Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been shown to produce synthetic images of compelling realism. In this work, we present a conditional GAN approach to generate contextually valid facial expressions in dyadic interactions. Contrary to previous work using conditions related to facial attributes of generated identities, we focus on dyads to model the influence of one person's facial expressions to the reaction of the other. We introduce a two level model of GANs in interviewer-interviewee interactions. In the first stage dynamic face sketches of interviewers are generated conditioned on expressions of the interviewee; in the second stage face images are synthesized from the face sketches. We demonstrate that our model is effective at synthesizing visually compelling face images in dyadic interactions. Moreover we quantitatively show that the facial expressions depicted in the generated interviewer face images reflect valid emotional reactions to the interviewee behavior.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w41/html/Khan_DyadGAN_Generating_Facial_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yuchi Huang, Saad M.

Dynamic Attention-Controlled Cascaded Shape Regression Exploiting Training Data Augmentation and Fuzzy-Set Sample Weighting	We present a new Cascaded Shape Regression (CSR) architecture, namely Dynamic Attention-Controlled CSR (DAC-CSR), for robust facial landmark detection on unconstrained faces. Our DAC-CSR divides facial landmark detection into three cascaded sub-tasks: face bounding box refinement, general CSR and attention-controlled CSR. The first two stages refine initial face bounding boxes and output intermediate facial landmarks. Then, an online dynamic model selection method is used to choose appropriate domain-specific CSRs for further landmark refinement. The key innovation of our DAC-CSR is the fault-tolerant mechanism, using fuzzy set sample weighting, for attention-controlled domain-specific model training. Moreover, we advocate data augmentation with a simple but effective 2D profile face generator, and context-aware feature extraction for better facial feature representation. Experimental results obtained on challenging datasets demonstrate the merits of our DAC-CSR over the state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Feng_Dynamic_Attention-Controlled_Cascaded_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhen-Hua Feng, Josef Kittler, William Christmas, Patrik Huber, Xiao-Jun Wu
Dynamic Edge-Conditioned Filters in Convolutional Neural Networks on Graphs	A number of problems can be formulated as prediction on graph-structured data. In this work, we generalize the convolution operator from regular grids to arbitrary graphs while avoiding the spectral domain, which allows us to handle graphs of varying size and connectivity. To move beyond a simple diffusion, filter weights are conditioned on the specific edge labels in the neighborhood of a vertex. Together with the proper choice of graph coarsening, we explore constructing deep neural networks for graph classification. In particular, we demonstrate the generality of our formulation in point cloud classification, where we set the new state of the art, and on a graph classification dataset, where we outperform other deep learning approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Simonovsky_Dynamic_Edge-Conditioned_Filters_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Martin Simonovsky, Nikos Komodakis

To be useful for vision research, such 4D scans need to be registered, or aligned, to a common topology. Consequently, extending mesh registration methods to 4D is important. Unfortunately, no ground-truth datasets are available for quantitative evaluation and comparison of 4D registration methods. To address this we create a novel dataset of high-resolution 4D scans of human subjects in motion, captured at 60 fps. We propose a new mesh registration method that uses both 3D geometry and texture information to register all scans in a sequence to a common reference topology. The approach exploits consistency in texture over both short and long time intervals and deals with temporal offsets between shape and texture capture. We show how using geometry alone results in significant errors in alignment when the motions are fast and non-rigid. We evaluate the accuracy of our registration and provide a dataset of 40,000 raw and aligned meshes. Dynamic FAUST extends the popular FAUST dataset to dynamic 4D data, and is available for research purposes at http://dfaust.is.tue.mpg.de.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Bogo_Dynamic_FAUST_Registering_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Federica Bogo, Javier Romero, Gerard Pons-Moll, Michael J.

Dynamic Facial Analysis: From Bayesian Filtering to Recurrent Neural Network	Facial analysis in videos, including head pose estimation and facial landmark localization, is key for many applications such as facial animation capture, human activity recognition, and human-computer interaction. In this paper, we propose to use a recurrent neural network (RNN) for joint estimation and tracking of facial features in videos. We are inspired by the fact that the computation performed in an RNN bears resemblance to Bayesian filters, which have been used for tracking in many previous methods for facial analysis from videos. Bayesian filters used in these methods, however, require complicated, problem-specific design and tuning. In contrast, our proposed RNN-based method avoids such tracker-engineering by learning from training data, similar to how a convolutional neural network (CNN) avoids feature-engineering for image classification. As an end-to-end network, the proposed RNN-based method provides a generic and holistic solution for joint estimation and tracking of various types of facial features from consecutive video frames. Extensive experimental results on head pose estimation and facial landmark localization from videos demonstrate that the proposed RNN-based method outperforms frame-wise models and Bayesian filtering. In addition, we create a large-scale synthetic dataset for head pose estimation, with which we achieve state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Gu_Dynamic_Facial_Analysis_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jinwei Gu, Xiaodong Yang, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz
Dynamic Time-Of-Flight	Time-of-flight (TOF) depth cameras provide robust depth inference at low power requirements in a wide variety of consumer and industrial applications. These cameras reconstruct a single depth frame from a given set of infrared (IR) frames captured over a very short exposure period. Operating in this mode the camera essentially forgets all information previously captured - and performs depth inference from scratch for every frame. We challenge this practice and propose using previously captured information when inferring depth. An inherent problem we have to address is camera motion over this longer period of collecting observations. We derive a probabilistic framework combining a simple but robust model of camera and object motion, together with an observation model. This combination allows us to integrate information over multiple frames while remaining robust to rapid changes. Operating the camera in this manner has implications in terms of both computational efficiency and how information should be captured. We address these two issues and demonstrate a realtime TOF system with robust temporal integration that improves depth accuracy over strong baseline methods including adaptive spatio-temporal filters.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Schober_Dynamic_Time-Of-Flight_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Michael Schober, Amit Adam, Omer Yair, Shai Mazor, Sebastian Nowozin
EAST: An Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detector	Previous approaches for scene text detection have already achieved promising performances across various benchmarks. However, they usually fall short when dealing with challenging scenarios, even when equipped with deep neural network models, because the overall performance is determined by the interplay of multiple stages and components in the pipelines. In this work, we propose a simple yet powerful pipeline that yields fast and accurate text detection in natural scenes. The pipeline directly predicts words or text lines of arbitrary orientations and quadrilateral shapes in full images, eliminating unnecessary intermediate steps (e.g., candidate aggregation and word partitioning), with a single neural network. The simplicity of our pipeline allows concentrating efforts on designing loss functions and neural network architecture. Experiments on standard datasets including ICDAR 2015, COCO-Text and MSRA-TD500 demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. On the ICDAR 2015 dataset, the proposed algorithm achieves an F-score of 0.7820 at 13.2fps at 720p resolution.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhou_EAST_An_Efficient_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xinyu Zhou, Cong Yao, He Wen, Yuzhi Wang, Shuchang Zhou, Weiran He, Jiajun Liang
ECO: Efficient Convolution Operators for Tracking	In recent years, Discriminative Correlation Filter (DCF) based methods have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in tracking. However, in the pursuit of ever increasing tracking performance, their characteristic speed and real-time capability have gradually faded. Further, the increasingly complex models, with massive number of trainable parameters, have introduced the risk of severe over-fitting. In this work, we tackle the key causes behind the problems of computational complexity and over-fitting, with the aim of simultaneously improving both speed and performance. We revisit the core DCF formulation and introduce: (i) a factorized convolution operator, which drastically reduces the number of parameters in the model; (ii) a compact generative model of the training sample distribution, that significantly reduces memory and time complexity, while providing better diversity of samples; (iii) a conservative model update strategy with improved robustness and reduced complexity. We perform comprehensive experiments on four benchmarks: VOT2016, UAV123, OTB-2015, and TempleColor. When using expensive deep features, our tracker provides a 20-fold speedup and achieves a 13.0% relative gain in Expected Average Overlap compared to the top ranked method in the VOT2016 challenge. Moreover, our fast variant, using hand-crafted features, operates at 60 Hz on a single CPU, while obtaining 65.0% AUC on OTB-2015.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Danelljan_ECO_Efficient_Convolution_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Martin Danelljan, Goutam Bhat, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Michael Felsberg
EDeN: Ensemble of Deep Networks for Vehicle Classification	Traffic surveillance has always been a challenging task to automate. The main difficulties arise from the high variation of the vehicles appertaining to the same category, low resolution, changes in illumination and occlusions. Due to the lack of large labeled datasets, deep learning techniques still have not shown their full potential. In this paper, we train an Ensemble of Deep Networks (EDeN) to successfully classify surveillance images into eleven different classes of vehicles. The MIO-TCD dataset consists of 786,702 images with high diversity and resembles a real-world environment. Extensive evaluation was performed using individual networks and different combinations of ensembles. Experimental results show that ensemble of networks gives better performance compared to individual networks and it is robust to noise. The ensemble of networks achieves an accuracy of 97.80%, mean precision of 94.39%, mean recall of 91.90% and Cohen kappa of 96.58%.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w9/html/Theagarajan_EDeN_Ensemble_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Rajkumar Theagarajan, Federico Pala, Bir Bhanu
EMOTIC: Emotions in Context Dataset	Recognizing people's emotions from their frame of reference is very important in our everyday life. This capacity helps us to perceive or predict the subsequent actions of people, interact effectively with them and to be sympathetic and sensitive toward them. Hence, one should expect that a machine needs to have a similar capability of understanding people's feelings in order to correctly interact with humans. Current research on emotion recognition has focused on the analysis of facial expressions. However, recognizing emotions requires also understanding the scene in which a person is immersed. The unavailability of suitable data to study such a problem has made research in emotion recognition in context difficult. In this paper, we present the EMOTIC database (from EMOTions In Context), a database of images with people in real environments, annotated with their apparent emotions. We defined an extended list of 26 emotion categories to annotate the images, and combined these annotations with three common continuous dimensions: Valence, Arousal, and Dominance. Images in the database are annotated using the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) platform. The resulting set contains 18,313 images with 23,788 annotated people. The goal of this paper is to present the EMOTIC database, detailing how it was created and the information available. We expect this dataset can help to open up new horizons on creating systems able of recognizing rich information about people's apparent emotional states.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w41/html/Lapedriza_EMOTIC_Emotions_in_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ronak Kosti, Jose M.

ER3: A Unified Framework for Event Retrieval, Recognition and Recounting	We develop a unified framework for complex event retrieval, recognition and recounting. The framework is based on a compact video representation that exploits the temporal correlations in image features. Our feature alignment procedure identifies and removes the feature redundancies across frames and outputs an intermediate tensor representation we call video imprint. The video imprint is then fed into a reasoning network, whose attention mechanism parallels that of memory networks used in language modeling. The reasoning network simultaneously recognizes the event category and locates the key pieces of evidence for event recounting. In event retrieval tasks, we show that the compact video representation aggregated from the video imprint achieves significantly better retrieval accuracy compared with existing methods. We also set new state of the art results in event recognition tasks with an additional benefit: The latent structure in our reasoning network highlights the areas of the video imprint and can be directly used for event recounting. As video imprint maps back to locations in the video frames, the network allows not only the identification of key frames but also specific areas inside each frame which are most influential to the decision process.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Gao_ER3_A_Unified_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhanning Gao, Gang Hua, Dongqing Zhang, Nebojsa Jojic, Le Wang, Jianru Xue, Nanning Zheng
Earth Observation Using SAR and Social Media Images	Earth Observation (EO) is mostly carried out through centralized optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) missions. Despite the controlled quality of their products, such observation is restricted by the characteristics of the sensor platform, e.g. the revisit time. Over the last decade, the rapid development of social media has accumulated vast amount of online images. Despite their uncontrolled quality, the sheer volume may contain useful information that can complement the EO missions, especially the SAR missions. This paper presents a preliminary work of fusing social media and SAR images. They have distinct imaging geometries, which are nearly impossible to even coregister without a precise 3-D model. We describe a general approach to coregister them without using external 3-D model. We demonstrate that, one can obtain a new kind of 3-D city model that includes the optical texture for better scene understanding and the precise deformation retrieved from SAR interferometry.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w18/html/Wang_Earth_Observation_Using_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yuanyuan Wang, Xiao Xiang Zhu
Efficient Diffusion on Region Manifolds: Recovering Small Objects With Compact CNN Representations	Query expansion is a popular method to improve the quality of image retrieval with both conventional and CNN representations. It has been so far limited to global image similarity. This work focuses on diffusion, a mechanism that captures the image manifold in the feature space. An efficient off-line stage allows optional reduction in the number of stored regions. In the on-line stage, the proposed handling of unseen queries in the indexing stage removes additional computation to adjust the precomputed data. We perform diffusion through a sparse linear system solver, yielding practical query times well below one second. Experimentally, we observe a significant boost in performance of image retrieval with compact CNN descriptors on standard benchmarks, especially when the query object covers only a small part of the image. Small objects have been a common failure case of CNN-based retrieval.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Iscen_Efficient_Diffusion_on_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ahmet Iscen, Giorgos Tolias, Yannis Avrithis, Teddy Furon, Ondrej Chum
Efficient Global Point Cloud Alignment Using Bayesian Nonparametric Mixtures	Point cloud alignment is a common problem in computer vision and robotics, with applications ranging from 3D object recognition to reconstruction. We propose a novel approach to the alignment problem that utilizes Bayesian nonparametrics to describe the point cloud and surface normal densities, and branch and bound (BB) optimization to recover the relative transformation. BB uses a novel, refinable, near-uniform tessellation of rotation space using 4D tetrahedra, leading to more efficient optimization compared to the common axis-angle tessellation. We provide objective function bounds for pruning given the proposed tessellation, and prove that BB converges to the optimum of the cost function along with providing its computational complexity. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach as well as its robustness to real-world conditions such as missing data and partial overlap.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Straub_Efficient_Global_Point_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Julian Straub, Trevor Campbell, Jonathan P.

Efficient Image Set Classification Using Linear Regression Based Image Reconstruction	We propose a novel image set classification technique using linear regression models. Downsampled gallery image sets are interpreted as subspaces of a high dimensional space to avoid the computationally expensive training step. We estimate regression models for each test image using the class specific gallery subspaces. Images of the test set are then reconstructed using the regression models. Based on the minimum reconstruction error between the reconstructed and the original images, a weighted voting strategy is used to classify the test set. We performed extensive evaluation on the benchmark UCSD/Honda, CMU Mobo and YouTube Celebrity datasets for face classification, and ETH-80 dataset for object classification. The results demonstrate that by using only a small amount of training data, our technique achieved competitive classification accuracy and superior computational speed compared with the state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w6/html/Shah_Efficient_Image_Set_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Syed A.

Efficient Linear Programming for Dense CRFs	The fully connected conditional random field (CRF) with Gaussian pairwise potentials has proven popular and effective for multi-class semantic segmentation. While the energy of a dense CRF can be minimized accurately using a linear programming (LP) relaxation, the state-of-the-art algorithm is too slow to be useful in practice. To alleviate this deficiency, we introduce an efficient LP minimization algorithm for dense CRFs. To this end, we develop a proximal minimization framework, where the dual of each proximal problem is optimized via block coordinate descent. We show that each block of variables can be efficiently optimized. Specifically, for one block, the problem decomposes into significantly smaller subproblems, each of which is defined over a single pixel. For the other block, the problem is optimized via conditional gradient descent. This has two advantages: 1) the conditional gradient can be computed in a time linear in the number of pixels and labels; and 2) the optimal step size can be computed analytically. Our experiments on standard datasets provide compelling evidence that our approach outperforms all existing baselines including the previous LP based approach for dense CRFs.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ajanthan_Efficient_Linear_Programming_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Thalaiyasingam Ajanthan, Alban Desmaison, Rudy Bunel, Mathieu Salzmann, Philip H.

Efficient Multiple Instance Metric Learning Using Weakly Supervised Data	"We consider learning a distance metric in a weakly supervised setting where ""bags"" (or sets) of instances are labeled with ""bags"" of labels. A general approach is to formulate the problem as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem where the metric is learned so that the distances between instances inferred to be similar are smaller than the distances between instances inferred to be dissimilar. Classic approaches alternate the optimization over the learned metric and the assignment of similar instances. In this paper, we propose an efficient method that jointly learns the metric and the assignment of instances. In particular, our model is learned by solving an extension of k-means for MIL problems where instances are assigned to categories depending on annotations provided at bag-level. Our learning algorithm is much faster than existing metric learning methods for MIL problems and obtains state-of-the-art recognition performance in automated image annotation and instance classification for face identification."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Law_Efficient_Multiple_Instance_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Marc T.

Efficient Optimization for Hierarchically-structured Interacting Segments (HINTS)	We propose an effective optimization algorithm for a general hierarchical segmentation model with geometric interactions between segments. Any given tree can specify a partial order over object labels defining a hierarchy. It is well-established that segment interactions, such as inclusion/exclusion and margin constraints, make the model significantly more discriminant. However, existing optimization methods do not allow full use of such models. Generic a-expansion results in weak local minima, while common binary multi-layered formulations lead to non-submodularity, complex high-order potentials, or polar domain unwrapping and shape biases. In practice, applying these methods to arbitrary trees does not work except for simple cases. Our main contribution is an optimization method for the Hierarchically-structured Interacting Segments (HINTS) model with arbitrary trees. Our Path-Moves algorithm is based on multi-label MRF formulation and can be seen as a combination of well-known a-expansion and Ishikawa techniques. We show state-of-the-art biomedical segmentation for many diverse examples of complex trees.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Isack_Efficient_Optimization_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hossam Isack, Olga Veksler, Ipek Oguz, Milan Sonka, Yuri Boykov
Efficient Scene Layout Aware Object Detection for Traffic Surveillance	We present an efficient scene layout aware object detection method for traffic surveillance. Given an input image, our approach first estimates its scene layout by transferring object annotations in a large dataset to the target image based on nonparametric label transfer. The transferred annotations are then integrated with object hypotheses generated by the state-of-the-art object detectors. We propose an approximate nearest neighbor search scheme for efficient inference in the scene layout estimation. Experiments verified that this simple and efficient approach provides consistent performance improvements to the state-of-the-art object detection baselines on all object categories in the TSWC-2017 localization challenge.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w9/html/Wang_Efficient_Scene_Layout_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tao Wang, Xuming He, Songzhi Su, Yin Guan
Efficient Solvers for Minimal Problems by Syzygy-Based Reduction	In this paper we study the problem of automatically generating polynomial solvers for minimal problems. The main contribution is a new method for finding small elimination templates by making use of the syzygies (i.e. the polynomial relations) that exist between the original equations. Using these syzygies we can essentially parameterize the set of possible elimination templates. We evaluate our method on a wide variety of problems from geometric computer vision and show improvement compared to both handcrafted and automatically generated solvers. Furthermore we apply our method on two previously unsolved relative orientation problems.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Larsson_Efficient_Solvers_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Viktor Larsson, Kalle Astrom, Magnus Oskarsson
EgoTracker: Pedestrian Tracking With Re-Identification in Egocentric Videos	We propose and analyze a novel framework for tracking a pedestrian in egocentric videos, which is needed for analyzing social gatherings recorded with a wearable camera. The constant camera and pedestrian movement makes this a challenging problem. The main challenges are natural head movement of wearer and target loss and reappearance in a later frame, due to frequent changes in field of view. By using the optical flow information specific to egocentric videos and also by modifying the learning process and sampling region of trackers which tracks by learning an SVM online, we show that re-identification is possible. The specific trackers chosen are STRUCK and MEEM.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w10/html/Nigam_EgoTracker_Pedestrian_Tracking_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jyoti Nigam, Renu M.

Elastic Shape-From-Template With Spatially Sparse Deforming Forces	Current Elastic SfT (Shape from Template) methods are based on l2-norm minimization. None can accurately recover the spatial location of the acting forces since l2-norm based minimization tends to find the best tradeoff among noisy data to fit an elastic model. In this work, we study shapes that are deformed with spatially sparse set of forces. We propose two formulations for a new class of SfT problems dubbed here SLE-SfT (Sparse Linear Elastic-SfT). The First ideal formulation uses an l0-norm to minimize the cardinal of non-zero components of the deforming forces. The second relaxed formulation uses an l1-norm to minimize the sum of absolute values of force components. These new formulations do not use Solid Boundary Constraints (SBC) which are usually needed to rigidly position the shape in the frame of the deformed image. We introduce the Projective Elastic Space Property (PESP) that jointly encodes the reprojection constraint and the elastic model. We prove that filling this property is necessary and sufficient for the relaxed formulation to: (i) retrieve the ground-truth 3D deformed shape, (ii) recover the right spatial domain of non-zero deforming forces. (iii) It also proves that we can rigidly place the deformed shape in the image frame without using SBC. Finally, we prove that when filling PESP, resolving the relaxed formulation provides the same ground-truth solution as the ideal formulation. Results with simulated and real data show substantial improvements in recovering the deformed shapes as well as the spatial location of the deforming forces.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Malti_Elastic_Shape-From-Template_With_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Abed Malti, Cedric Herzet
Embedded Robust Visual Obstacle Detection on Autonomous Lawn Mowers	Currently, the only mass-market service robots are floor cleaners and lawn mowers. Although available for more than 20 years, they mostly lack intelligent functions from modern robot research. In particular, the obstacle detection and avoidance is typically a simple physical collision detection. In this work, we discuss a prototype autonomous lawn mower with camera-based non-contact obstacle avoidance. We devised a low-cost compact module consisting of color cameras and an ARM-based processing board, which can be added to an autonomous lawn mower with minimal effort. For testing our system, we conducted a field test with 20 prototype units distributed in eight European countries with a total mowing time of 3,494 hours. The results show that our proposed system is able to work without expert interaction for a full season and strongly reduces collision events while still keeping the good mowing performance.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w4/html/Franzius_Embedded_Robust_Visual_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mathias Franzius, Mark Dunn, Nils Einecke, Roman Dirnberger
Emotion Recognition in Context	Understanding what a person is experiencing from her frame of reference is essential in our everyday life. For this reason, one can think that machines with this type of ability would interact better with people. However, there are no current systems capable of understanding in detail people's emotional states. Previous research on computer vision to recognize emotions has mainly focused on analyzing the facial expression, usually classifying it into the 6 basic emotions [11]. However, the context plays an important role in emotion perception, and when the context is incorporated, we can infer more emotional states. In this paper we present the Emotions in Context Database (EMCO), a dataset of images containing people in context in non-controlled environments. In these images, people are annotated with 26 emotional categories and also with the continuous dimensions valence, arousal, and dominance [21]. With the EMCO dataset, we trained a Convolutional Neural Network model that jointly analyzes the person and the whole scene to recognize rich information about emotional states. With this, we show the importance of considering the context for recognizing people's emotions in images, and provide a benchmark in the task of emotion recognition in visual context.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kosti_Emotion_Recognition_in_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ronak Kosti, Jose M.

End-To-End 3D Face Reconstruction With Deep Neural Networks	Monocular 3D facial shape reconstruction from a single 2D facial image has been an active research area due to its wide applications. Inspired by the success of deep neural networks (DNN), we propose a DNN-based approach for End-to-End 3D FAce Reconstruction (UH-E2FAR) from a single 2D image. Different from recent works that reconstruct and refine the 3D face in an iterative manner using both an RGB image and an initial 3D facial shape rendering, our DNN model is end-to-end, and thus the complicated 3D rendering process can be avoided. Moreover, we integrate in the DNN architecture two components, namely a multi-task loss function and a fusion convolutional neural network (CNN) to improve facial expression reconstruction. With the multi-task loss function, 3D face reconstruction is divided into neutral 3D facial shape reconstruction and expressive 3D facial shape reconstruction. The neutral 3D facial shape is class-specific. Therefore, higher layer features are useful. In comparison, the expressive 3D facial shape favors lower or intermediate layer features. With the fusion-CNN, features from different intermediate layers are fused and transformed for predicting the 3D expressive facial shape. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of our end-to-end framework in improving the accuracy of 3D face reconstruction.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Dou_End-To-End_3D_Face_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Pengfei Dou, Shishir K.

End-To-End Concept Word Detection for Video Captioning, Retrieval, and Question Answering	We propose a high-level concept word detector that can be integrated with any video-to-language models. It takes a video as input and generates a list of concept words as useful semantic priors for language generation models. The proposed word detector has two important properties. First, it does not require any external knowledge sources for training. Second, the proposed word detector is trainable in an end-to-end manner jointly with any video-to-language models. To effectively exploit the detected words, we also develop a semantic attention mechanism that selectively focuses on the detected concept words and fuse them with the word encoding and decoding in the language model. In order to demonstrate that the proposed approach indeed improves the performance of multiple video-to-language tasks, we participate in all the four tasks of LSMDC 2016. Our approach has won three of them, including fill-in-the-blank, multiple-choice test, and movie retrieval.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yu_End-To-End_Concept_Word_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Youngjae Yu, Hyungjin Ko, Jongwook Choi, Gunhee Kim
End-To-End Driving in a Realistic Racing Game With Deep Reinforcement Learning	We address the problem of autonomous race car driving. Using a recent rally game (WRC6) with realistic physics and graphics we train an Asynchronous Actor Critic (A3C) in an end-to-end fashion and propose an improved reward function to learn faster. The network is trained simultaneously on three very different tracks (snow, mountain, and coast) with various road structures, graphics and physics. Despite the more complex environments the trained agent learns significant features and exhibits good performance while driving in a more stable way than existing end-to-end approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w5/html/Perot_End-To-End_Driving_in_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Etienne Perot, Maximilian Jaritz, Marin Toromanoff, Raoul de Charette
End-To-End Ego Lane Estimation Based on Sequential Transfer Learning for Self-Driving Cars	Autonomous cars establish driving strategies using the positions of ego lanes. The previous methods detect lane points and select ego lanes with heuristic and complex postprocessing with strong geometric assumptions. We propose a sequential end-to-end transfer learning method to estimate left and right ego lanes directly and separately without any postprocessing. We redefined a point-detection problem as a region-segmentation problem; as a result, the proposed method is insensitive to occlusions and variations of environmental conditions, because it considers the entire content of an input image during training. Also, we constructed an extensive dataset that is suitable for a deep neural network training by collecting a variety of road conditions, annotating ego lanes, and augmenting them systematically. The proposed method demonstrated improved accuracy and stability on input variations compared with a recent method based on deep learning. Our approach does not involve postprocessing, and is therefore flexible to change of target domain.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w13/html/Kim_End-To-End_Ego_Lane_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jiman Kim, Chanjong Park
End-To-End Instance Segmentation With Recurrent Attention	While convolutional neural networks have gained impressive success recently in solving structured prediction problems such as semantic segmentation, it remains a challenge to differentiate individual object instances in the scene. Instance segmentation is very important in a variety of applications, such as autonomous driving, image captioning, and visual question answering. Techniques that combine large graphical models with low-level vision have been proposed to address this problem; however, we propose an end-to-end recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture with an attention mechanism to model a human-like counting process, and produce detailed instance segmentations. The network is jointly trained to sequentially produce regions of interest as well as a dominant object segmentation within each region. The proposed model achieves competitive results on the CVPPP, KITTI, and Cityscapes datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ren_End-To-End_Instance_Segmentation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mengye Ren, Richard S.

End-To-End Learning of Driving Models From Large-Scale Video Datasets	Robust perception-action models should be learned from training data with diverse visual appearances and realistic behaviors, yet current approaches to deep visuomotor policy learning have been generally limited to in-situ models learned from a single vehicle or simulation environment. We advocate learning a generic vehicle motion model from large scale crowd-sourced video data, and develop an end-to-end trainable architecture for learning to predict a distribution over future vehicle egomotion from instantaneous monocular camera observations and previous vehicle state. Our model incorporates a novel FCN-LSTM architecture, which can be learned from large-scale crowd-sourced vehicle action data, and leverages available scene segmentation side tasks to improve performance under a privileged learning paradigm. We provide a novel large-scale dataset of crowd-sourced driving behavior suitable for training our model, and report results predicting the driver action on held out sequences across diverse conditions.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xu_End-To-End_Learning_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Huazhe Xu, Yang Gao, Fisher Yu, Trevor Darrell
End-To-End Representation Learning for Correlation Filter Based Tracking	The Correlation Filter is an algorithm that trains a linear template to discriminate between images and their translations. It is well suited to object tracking because its formulation in the Fourier domain provides a fast solution, enabling the detector to be re-trained once per frame. Previous works that use the Correlation Filter, however, have adopted features that were either manually designed or trained for a different task. This work is the first to overcome this limitation by interpreting the Correlation Filter learner, which has a closed-form solution, as a differentiable layer in a deep neural network. This enables learning deep features that are tightly coupled to the Correlation Filter. Experiments illustrate that our method has the important practical benefit of allowing lightweight architectures to achieve state-of-the-art performance at high framerates.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Valmadre_End-To-End_Representation_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jack Valmadre, Luca Bertinetto, Joao Henriques, Andrea Vedaldi, Philip H.

End-To-End Training of Hybrid CNN-CRF Models for Stereo	We propose a novel and principled hybrid CNN+CRF model for stereo estimation. Our model allows to exploit the advantages of both, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and conditional random fields (CRFs) in an unified approach. The CNNs compute expressive features for matching and distinctive color edges, which in turn are used to compute the unary and binary costs of the CRF. For inference, we apply a recently proposed highly parallel dual block descent algorithm which only needs a small fixed number of iterations to compute a high-quality approximate minimizer. As the main contribution of the paper, we propose a theoretically sound method based on the structured output support vector machine (SSVM) to train the hybrid CNN+CRF model on large-scale data end-to-end. Our trained models perform very well despite the fact that we are using shallow CNNs and do not apply any kind of post-processing to the final output of the CRF. We evaluate our combined models on challenging stereo benchmarks such as Middlebury 2014 and Kitti 2015 and also investigate the performance of each individual component.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Knobelreiter_End-To-End_Training_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Patrick Knobelreiter, Christian Reinbacher, Alexander Shekhovtsov, Thomas Pock
Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution	Recent research on super-resolution has progressed with the development of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). In particular, residual learning techniques exhibit improved performance. In this paper, we develop an enhanced deep super-resolution network (EDSR) with performance exceeding those of current state-of-the-art SR methods. The significant performance improvement of our model is due to optimization by removing unnecessary modules in conventional residual networks. The performance is further improved by expanding the model size while we stabilize the training procedure. We also propose a new multi-scale deep super-resolution system (MDSR) and training method, which can reconstruct high-resolution images of different upscaling factors in a single model. The proposed methods show superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets and prove its excellence by winning the NTIRE2017 Super-Resolution Challenge.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w12/html/Lim_Enhanced_Deep_Residual_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Bee Lim, Sanghyun Son, Heewon Kim, Seungjun Nah, Kyoung Mu Lee
Enhancing Detection Model for Multiple Hypothesis Tracking	Tracking-by-detection has become a popular tracking paradigm in recent years. Due to the fact that detections within this framework are regarded as points in the tracking process, it brings data association ambiguities, especially in crowded scenarios. To cope with this issue, we extended the multiple hypothesis tracking approach by incorporating a novel enhancing detection model that included detection-scene analysis and detection-detection analysis; the former models the scene by using dense confidential detections and handles false trajectories, while the latter estimates the correlations between individual detections and improves the ability to deal with close object hypotheses in crowded scenarios. Our approach was tested on the MOT16 benchmark and achieved competitive results with current state-of-the-art trackers.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w34/html/Chen_Enhancing_Detection_Model_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jiahui Chen, Hao Sheng, Yang Zhang, Zhang Xiong
Enhancing Video Summarization via Vision-Language Embedding	This paper addresses video summarization, or the problem of distilling a raw video into a shorter form while still capturing the original story. We show that visual representations supervised by freeform language make a good fit for this application by extending a recent submodular summarization approach with representativeness and interestingness objectives computed on features from a joint vision-language embedding space. We perform an evaluation on two diverse datasets, UT Egocentric and TV Episodes, and show that our new objectives give improved summarization ability compared to standard visual features alone. Our experiments also show that the vision-language embedding need not be trained on domain specific data, but can be learned from standard still image vision-language datasets and transferred to video. A further benefit of our model is the ability to guide a summary using freeform text input at test time, allowing user customization.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Plummer_Enhancing_Video_Summarization_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Bryan A.

Episode-Based Active Learning With Bayesian Neural Networks	We investigate different strategies for active learning with Bayesian deep neural networks. We focus our analysis on scenarios where new, unlabeled data is obtained episodically, such as commonly encountered in mobile robotics applications. An evaluation of different strategies for acquisition, updating, and final training on the CIFAR-10 dataset shows that incremental network updates with final training on the accumulated acquisition set are essential for best performance, while limiting the amount of required human labeling labor.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w5/html/Dayoub_Episode-Based_Active_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Feras Dayoub, Niko Sunderhauf, Peter I.

Episodic CAMN: Contextual Attention-Based Memory Networks With Iterative Feedback for Scene Labeling	Scene labeling can be seen as a sequence-sequence prediction task (pixels-labels), and it is quite important to leverage relevant context to enhance the performance of pixel classification. In this paper, we introduce an episodic attention-based memory network to achieve the goal. We present a unified framework that mainly consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically, Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and an attention-based memory module with feedback connections to perform context selection and refinement. The full model produces context-aware representation for each target patch by aggregating the activated context and its original local representation produced by the convolution layers. We evaluate our model on PASCAL Context, SIFT Flow and PASCAL VOC 2011 datasets and achieve competitive results to other state-of-the-art methods in scene labeling.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Abdulnabi_Episodic_CAMN_Contextual_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Abrar H.

Estimation of Affective Level in the Wild With Multiple Memory Networks	"This paper presents the proposed solution to the ""affect in the wild"" challenge, which aims to estimate the affective level, i.e. the valence and arousal values, of every frame in a video. A carefully designed deep convolutional neural network (a variation of residual network) for affective level estimation of facial expressions is first implemented as a baseline. Next we use multiple memory networks to model the temporal relations between the frames. Finally ensemble models are used to combine the predictions from multiple memory networks. Our proposed solution outperforms the baseline model by a factor of 10.62% in terms of mean square error (MSE)."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w33/html/Li_Estimation_of_Affective_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jianshu Li, Yunpeng Chen, Shengtao Xiao, Jian Zhao, Sujoy Roy, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan, Terence Sim
Evaluating State-Of-The-Art Object Detector on Challenging Traffic Light Data	Traffic light detection (TLD) is a vital part of both intelligent vehicles and driving assistance systems (DAS). hard to determine the exact performance of a given method. In this paper we apply the state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system You Only Look Once, (YOLO) on the public LISA Traffic Light dataset available through the VIVA-challenge, which contain a high number of annotated traffic lights, captured in varying light and weather conditions. The YOLO object detector achieves an AUC of impressively 90.49 % for daysequence1, which is an improvement of 50.32 % compared to the latest ACF entry in the VIVA-challenge. Using the exact same training configuration as the ACF detector, the YOLO detector reaches an AUC of 58.3 %, which is in an increase of 18.13 %.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w9/html/Jensen_Evaluating_State-Of-The-Art_Object_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Morten B.

Even More Confident Predictions With Deep Machine-Learning	Confidence measures aim at discriminating unreliable disparities inferred by a stereo vision system from reliable ones. A common and effective strategy adopted by most top-performing approaches consists in combining multiple confidence measures by means of an appropriately trained random-forest classifier. In this paper, we propose a novel approach by training an n-channel convolutional neural network on a set of feature maps, each one encoding the outcome of a single confidence measure. This strategy enables to move the confidence prediction problem from the conventional 1D feature maps domain, adopted by approaches based on random-forests, to a more distinctive 3D domain, going beyond single pixel analysis. This fact, coupled with a deep network appropriately trained on a small subset of images, enables to outperform top-performing approaches based on random-forests.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w4/html/Poggi_Even_More_Confident_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Matteo Poggi, Fabio Tosi, Stefano Mattoccia
Event-Based Visual Inertial Odometry	Event-based cameras provide a new visual sensing model by detecting changes in image intensity asynchronously across all pixels on the camera. By providing these events at extremely high rates (up to 1MHz), they allow for sensing in both high speed and high dynamic range situations where traditional cameras may fail. In this paper, we present the first algorithm to fuse a purely event-based tracking algorithm with an inertial measurement unit, to provide accurate metric tracking of a camera's full 6dof pose. Our algorithm is asynchronous, and provides measurement updates at a rate proportional to the camera velocity. The algorithm selects features in the image plane, and tracks spatiotemporal windows around these features within the event stream. An Extended Kalman Filter with a structureless measurement model then fuses the feature tracks with the output of the IMU. The camera poses from the filter are then used to initialize the next step of the tracker and reject failed tracks. We show that our method successfully tracks camera motion on the Event-Camera Dataset in a number of challenging situations.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhu_Event-Based_Visual_Inertial_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Alex Zihao Zhu, Nikolay Atanasov, Kostas Daniilidis
Exclusivity-Consistency Regularized Multi-View Subspace Clustering	Multi-view subspace clustering aims to partition a set of multi-source data into their underlying groups. To boost the performance of multi-view clustering, numerous subspace learning algorithms have been developed in recent years, but with rare exploitation of the representation complementarity between different views as well as the indicator consistency among the representations, let alone considering them simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view subspace clustering model that attempts to harness the complementary information between different representations by introducing a novel position-aware exclusivity term. Meanwhile, a consistency term is employed to make these complementary representations to further have a common indicator. We formulate the above concerns into a unified optimization framework. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets are conducted to reveal the effectiveness of our algorithm over other state-of-the-arts.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_Exclusivity-Consistency_Regularized_Multi-View_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xiaobo Wang, Xiaojie Guo, Zhen Lei, Changqing Zhang, Stan Z.

Expecting the Unexpected: Training Detectors for Unusual Pedestrians With Adversarial Imposters	"As autonomous vehicles become an every-day reality, high-accuracy pedestrian detection is of paramount practical importance. Pedestrian detection is a highly researched topic with mature methods, but most datasets (for both training and evaluation) focus on common scenes of people engaged in typical walking poses on sidewalks. But performance is most crucial for dangerous scenarios that are rarely observed, such as children playing in the street and people using bicycles/skateboards in unexpected ways. Such ""in-the-tail"" data is notoriously hard to observe, making both training and testing difficult. To analyze this problem, we have collected a novel annotated dataset of dangerous scenarios called the Precarious Pedestrian dataset. Even given a dedicated collection effort, it is relatively small by contemporary standards (~ 1000 images). To explore large-scale data-driven learning, we explore the use of synthetic data generated by a game engine. A significant challenge is selected the right ""priors"" or parameters for synthesis: we would like realistic data with realistic poses and object configurations. Inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks, we generate a massive amount of synthetic data and train a discriminative classifier to select a realistic subset (that fools the classifier), which we deem Synthetic Imposters. We demonstrate that this pipeline allows one to generate realistic (or adverserial) training data by making use of rendering/animation engines. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that such data can be used to rank algorithms, suggesting that Synthetic Imposters can also be used for ""in-the-tail"" validation at test-time, a notoriously difficult challenge for real-world deployment."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Huang_Expecting_the_Unexpected_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shiyu Huang, Deva Ramanan
Expert Gate: Lifelong Learning With a Network of Experts	In this paper we introduce a model of lifelong learning, based on a Network of Experts. New tasks / experts are learned and added to the model sequentially, building on what was learned before. To ensure scalability of this process, data from previous tasks cannot be stored and hence is not available when learning a new task. A critical issue in such context, not addressed in the literature so far, relates to the decision which expert to deploy at test time. We introduce a set of gating autoencoders that learn a representation for the task at hand, and, at test time, automatically forward the test sample to the relevant expert. This also brings memory efficiency as only one expert network has to be loaded into memory at any given time. Further, the autoencoders inherently capture the relatedness of one task to another, based on which the most relevant prior model to be used for training a new expert, with fine-tuning or learning-without-forgetting, can be selected. We evaluate our method on image classification and video prediction problems.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Aljundi_Expert_Gate_Lifelong_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Rahaf Aljundi, Punarjay Chakravarty, Tinne Tuytelaars
Explaining Distributed Neural Activations via Unsupervised Learning	Recent work has demonstrated the emergence of semantic object-part detectors in activation patterns of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but did not account for the distributed multi-layer neural activations in such networks. In this work, we propose a novel method to extract distributed patterns of activations from a CNN and show that such patterns correspond to high-level visual attributes. We propose an unsupervised learning module that sits above a pre-trained CNN and learns distributed activation patterns of the network. We utilize elastic non-negative matrix factorization to analyze the responses of a pretrained CNN to an input image and extract salient image regions. The corresponding patterns of neural activations for the extracted salient regions are then clustered via unsupervised deep embedding for clustering (DEC) framework. We demonstrate that these distributed activations contain high-level image features that could be explicitly used for image classification.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w26/html/Kolouri_Explaining_Distributed_Neural_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Soheil Kolouri, Charles E.

Explaining the Unexplained: A CLass-Enhanced Attentive Response (CLEAR) Approach to Understanding Deep Neural Networks	In this work, we propose CLass-Enhanced Attentive Response (CLEAR): an approach to visualize and understand the decisions made by deep neural networks (DNNs) given a specific input. CLEAR facilitates the visualization of attentive regions and levels of interest of DNNs during the decision-making process. It also enables the visualization of the most dominant classes associated with these attentive regions of interest. As such, CLEAR can mitigate some of the shortcomings of heatmap-based methods associated with decision ambiguity, and allows for better insights into the decision-making process of DNNs. Quantitative and qualitative experiments across three different datasets demonstrate the efficacy of CLEAR for gaining a better understanding of the inner workings of DNNs during the decision-making process.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w26/html/Kumar_Explaining_the_Unexplained_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Devinder Kumar, Alexander Wong, Graham W.

Exploiting 2D Floorplan for Building-Scale Panorama RGBD Alignment	This paper presents a novel algorithm that utilizes a 2D floorplan to align panorama RGBD scans. While effective panorama RGBD alignment techniques exist, such a system requires extremely dense RGBD image sampling. Our approach can significantly reduce the number of necessary scans with the aid of a floorplan image. We formulate a novel Markov Random Field inference problem as a scan placement over the floorplan, as opposed to the conventional scan-to-scan alignment. The technical contributions lie in multi-modal image correspondence cues (between scans and schematic floorplan) as well as a novel coverage potential avoiding an inherent stacking bias. The proposed approach has been evaluated on five challenging large indoor spaces. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first effective system that utilizes a 2D floorplan image for building-scale 3D pointcloud alignment. The source code and the data are shared with the community to further enhance indoor mapping research.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wijmans_Exploiting_2D_Floorplan_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Erik Wijmans, Yasutaka Furukawa
Exploiting Reflectional and Rotational Invariance in Single Image Superresolution	Stationarity of reconstruction problems is the crux to enabling convolutional neural networks for many image processing tasks: the output estimate for a pixel is generally not dependent on its location within the image but only on its immediate neighbourhood. We expect other invariances, too. For most pixel-processing tasks, rigid transformations should commute with the processing: a rigid transformation of the input should result in that same transformation of the output. In existing literature this is taken into account indirectly by augmenting the training set: reflected and rotated versions of the inputs are also fed to the network when optimizing the network weights. In contrast, we enforce this invariance through the network design. Because of the encompassing nature of the proposed architecture, it can directly enhance existing CNN-based algorithms. We show how it can be applied to SRCNN and FSRCNN both, speeding up convergence in the initial training phase, and improving performance both for pretrained weights and after finetuning.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w12/html/Donne_Exploiting_Reflectional_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Simon Donne, Laurens Meeus, Hiep Quang Luong, Bart Goossens, Wilfried Philips
Exploiting Saliency for Object Segmentation From Image Level Labels	There have been remarkable improvements in the semantic labelling task in the recent years. However, the state of the art methods rely on large-scale pixel-level annotations. This paper studies the problem of training a pixel-wise semantic labeller network from image-level annotations of the present object classes. Recently, it has been shown that high quality seeds indicating discriminative object regions can be obtained from image-level labels. Without additional information, obtaining the full extent of the object is an inherently ill-posed problem due to co-occurrences. We propose using a saliency model as additional information and hereby exploit prior knowledge on the object extent and image statistics. We show how to combine both information sources in order to recover 80% of the fully supervised performance - which is the new state of the art in weakly supervised training for pixel-wise semantic labelling.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Oh_Exploiting_Saliency_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Seong Joon Oh, Rodrigo Benenson, Anna Khoreva, Zeynep Akata, Mario Fritz, Bernt Schiele
Exploiting Symmetry and/or Manhattan Properties for 3D Object Structure Estimation From Single and Multiple Images	Many man-made objects have intrinsic symmetries and Manhattan structure. By assuming an orthographic projection model, this paper addresses the estimation of 3D structures and camera projection using symmetry and/or Manhattan structure cues, which occur when the input is single- or multiple-image from the same category, e.g., multiple different cars. Specifically, analysis on the single image case implies that Manhattan alone is sufficient to recover the camera projection, and then the 3D structure can be reconstructed uniquely exploiting symmetry. However, Manhattan structure can be difficult to observe from a single image due to occlusion. To this end, we extend to the multiple-image case which can also exploit symmetry but does not require Manhattan axes. We propose a novel rigid structure from motion method, exploiting symmetry and using multiple images from the same category as input. Experimental results on the Pascal3D+ dataset show that our method significantly outperforms baseline methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Gao_Exploiting_Symmetry_andor_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yuan Gao, Alan L.

Exploration of Social and Web Image Search Results Using Tensor Decomposition	"How do socially popular images differ from authoritative images indexed by web search engines? Empirically, social images on e.g., Twitter often tend to look more diverse and ultimately more ""personal"", contrary to images that are returned by web image search, some of which are so-called ""stock"" images. Are there image features, that we can automatically learn, which differentiate the two types of image search results, or features that the two have in common? This paper outlines the vision towards achieving this result. We propose a tensor-based approach that learns key features of social and web image search results, and provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing and understanding the similarities and differences between the two types types of content. We demonstrate our preliminary results on a small-scale study, and conclude with future research directions for this exciting and novel application."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w29/html/Yang_Exploration_of_Social_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Liuqing Yang, Evangelos E.

Exploring Contextual Engagement for Trauma Recovery	A wide range of research has used face data to estimate a person's engagement, in applications from advertising to student learning. An interesting and important question not addressed in prior work is if face-based models of engagement are generalizable and context-free, or do engagement models depend on context and task. This research shows that context-sensitive face-based engagement models are more accurate, at least in the space of web-based tools for trauma recovery. Estimating engagement is important as various psychological studies indicate that engagement is a key component to measure the effectiveness of treatment and can be predictive of behavioral outcomes in many applications. In this paper, we analyze user engagement in a trauma-recovery regime during two separate modules/tasks: relaxation and triggers. The dataset comprises of 8M+ frames from multiple videos collected from 110 subjects, with engagement data coming from 800+ subject self-reports. We build an engagement prediction model as sequence learning from facial Action Units (AUs) using Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs). Our experiments demonstrate that engagement prediction is contextual and depends significantly on the allocated task. Models trained to predict engagement on one task are only weak predictors for another and are much less accurate than context-specific models. Further, we show the interplay of subject mood and engagement using a very short version of Profile of Mood States (POMS) to extend our LSTM model.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w41/html/Boult_Exploring_Contextual_Engagement_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Svati Dhamija, Terrance E.

Exploring the Granularity of Sparsity in Convolutional Neural Networks	Granularity of sparsity affects the prediction accuracy of Deep Neural Network models. In this paper we quantitatively measure the accuracy-sparsity relationship with different grain sizes. The results validate the previous observations that larger grain size leads to worse accuracy. However, due to the index saving effect, coarse-grained sparsity is able to obtain similar or even better compression rates than fine-grained sparsity at the same accuracy threshold. Our analysis, which is based on the framework of recent sparse convolutional neural network(SCNN) accelerator, further demonstrates that it saves 30% - 35% of memory references compared with fine-grained ones.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w29/html/Mao_Exploring_the_Granularity_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Huizi Mao, Song Han, Jeff Pool, Wenshuo Li, Xingyu Liu, Yu Wang, William J.

Extraction and Classification of Diving Clips From Continuous Video Footage	The recording of video data has become a common component of athlete training programmes. However, the manual analysis of the obtained footage is time-consuming and requires domain-specific knowledge. In order to automate this kind of task, most previous work has focused on just one of the following sub-problems: 1) temporally cropping events/actions of interest from continuous video; 2) tracking the object of interest; and 3) classifying the events/actions of interest. In contrast, this paper provides a complete solution to the overall action monitoring task in the context of a challenging real-world exemplar, diving classification. The model is required to learn the temporal boundaries of a dive, even though the subject is small and other divers and bystanders may be in view, and must also be sensitive to subtle changes in body pose in order to classify the dive. We propose effective techniques which work in tandem and can be easily generalized to video footage from other sports.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w2/html/Nibali_Extraction_and_Classification_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Aiden Nibali, Zhen He, Stuart Morgan, Daniel Greenwood
FASON: First and Second Order Information Fusion Network for Texture Recognition	Deep networks have shown impressive performance on many computer vision tasks. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to learn discriminative texture representations. One of the most successful approaches is Bilinear CNN model that explicitly captures the second order statistics within deep features. However, these networks cut off the first order information flow in the deep network and make gradient back-propagation difficult. We propose an effective fusion architecture - FASON that combines second order information flow and first order information flow. Our method allows gradients to back-propagate through both flows freely and can be trained effectively. We then build a multi-level deep architecture to exploit the first and second order information within different convolutional layers. Experiments show that our method achieves improvements over state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Dai_FASON_First_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xiyang Dai, Joe Yue-Hei Ng, Larry S.

FAST: A Framework to Accelerate Super-Resolution Processing on Compressed Videos	State-of-the-art super-resolution (SR) algorithms require significant computation resources to achieve real-time throughput (e.g., 60Mpixels/s for HD video). This paper introduces FAST (Free Adaptive Super-resolution via Transfer), a framework to accelerate any SR algorithm applied to compressed videos. FAST exploits the temporal correlation between adjacent frames such that SR is only applied to a subset of frames; SR pixels are then transferred to the other frames. The transferring process has negligible computation cost as it uses information already embedded in the compressed video (e.g., motion vectors and residual). Adaptive processing is used to retain accuracy when the temporal correlation is not present (e.g., occlusions). FAST accelerates state-of-the-art SR algorithms by up to 15x with a visual quality loss of 0.2dB. FAST is an important step towards real-time SR algorithms for ultra-HD displays and energy constrained devices (e.g., phones and tablets).	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w12/html/Zhang_FAST_A_Framework_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhengdong Zhang, Vivienne Sze
FATAUVA-Net : An Integrated Deep Learning Framework for Facial Attribute Recognition, Action Unit Detection, and Valence-Arousal Estimation	"Facial expression recognition has been investigated for many years, and there are two popular models: Action Units (AUs) and the Valence-Arousal space (V-A space) that have been widely used. However, most of the databases for estimating V-A intensity are captured in laboratory settings, and the benchmarks ""in-the-wild"" do not exist. Thus, the First Affect-In-The-Wild Challenge released a database for V-A estimation while the videos were captured in wild condition. In this paper, we propose an integrated deep learning framework for facial attribute recognition, AU detection, and V-A estimation. The key idea is to apply AUs to estimate the V-A intensity since both AUs and V-A space could be utilized to recognize some emotion categories. Besides, the AU detector is trained based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) for facial attribute recognition. In experiments, we will show the results of the above three tasks to verify the performances of our proposed network framework."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w33/html/Chang_FATAUVA-Net__An_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Wei-Yi Chang, Shih-Huan Hsu, Jen-Hsien Chien
FC4: Fully Convolutional Color Constancy With Confidence-Weighted Pooling	"Improvements in color constancy have arisen from the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the patch-based CNNs that exist for this problem are faced with the issue of estimation ambiguity, where a patch may contain insufficient information to establish a unique or even a limited possible range of illumination colors. Image patches with estimation ambiguity not only appear with great frequency in photographs, but also significantly degrade the quality of network training and inference. To overcome this problem, we present a fully convolutional network architecture in which patches throughout an image can carry different confidence weights according to the value they provide for color constancy estimation. These confidence weights are learned and applied within a novel pooling layer where the local estimates are merged into a global solution. With this formulation, the network is able to determine ""what to learn"" and ""how to pool"" automatically from color constancy datasets without additional supervision. The proposed network also allows for end-to-end training, and achieves higher efficiency and accuracy. On standard benchmarks, our network outperforms the previous state-of-the-art while achieving 120x greater efficiency."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Hu_FC4_Fully_Convolutional_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yuanming Hu, Baoyuan Wang, Stephen Lin
FCSS: Fully Convolutional Self-Similarity for Dense Semantic Correspondence	We present a descriptor, called fully convolutional self-similarity (FCSS), for dense semantic correspondence. To robustly match points among different instances within the same object class, we formulate FCSS using local self-similarity (LSS) within a fully convolutional network. In contrast to existing CNN-based descriptors, FCSS is inherently insensitive to intra-class appearance variations because of its LSS-based structure, while maintaining the precise localization ability of deep neural networks. The sampling patterns of local structure and the self-similarity measure are jointly learned within the proposed network in an end-to-end and multi-scale manner. As training data for semantic correspondence is rather limited, we propose to leverage object candidate priors provided in existing image datasets and also correspondence consistency between object pairs to enable weakly-supervised learning. Experiments demonstrate that FCSS outperforms conventional handcrafted descriptors and CNN-based descriptors on various benchmarks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kim_FCSS_Fully_Convolutional_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Seungryong Kim, Dongbo Min, Bumsub Ham, Sangryul Jeon, Stephen Lin, Kwanghoon Sohn
FFTLasso: Large-Scale LASSO in the Fourier Domain	In this paper, we revisit the LASSO sparse representation problem, which has been studied and used in a variety of different areas, ranging from signal processing and information theory to computer vision and machine learning. In the vision community, it found its way into many important applications, including face recognition, tracking, super resolution, image denoising, to name a few. Despite advances in efficient sparse algorithms, solving large-scale LASSO problems remains a challenge. To circumvent this difficulty, people tend to downsample and subsample the problem (e.g. via dimensionality reduction) to maintain a manageable sized LASSO, which usually comes at the cost of losing solution accuracy. This paper proposes a novel circulant reformulation of the LASSO that lifts the problem to a higher dimension, where ADMM can be efficiently applied to its dual form. Because of this lifting, all optimization variables are updated using only basic element-wise operations, the most computationally expensive of which is a 1D FFT. In this way, there is no need for a linear system solver nor matrix-vector multiplication. Since all operations in our FFTLasso method are element-wise, the subproblems are completely independent and can be trivially parallelized (e.g. on a GPU). The attractive computational properties of FFTLasso are verified by extensive experiments on synthetic and real data and on the face recognition task. They demonstrate that FFTLasso scales much more effectively than a state-of-the-art solver.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Bibi_FFTLasso_Large-Scale_LASSO_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Adel Bibi, Hani Itani, Bernard Ghanem
FORMS-Locks: A Dataset for the Evaluation of Similarity Measures for Forensic Toolmark Images	We present a toolmark dataset created using lock cylinders seized during criminal investigations of break-ins. A total number of 197 cylinders from 48 linked criminal cases were photographed under a comparison microscope used by forensic experts for toolmark comparisons. In order to allow an assessment of the influence of different lighting conditions, all images were captured using a ring light with 11 different lighting settings. Further, matching image regions in the toolmark images were manually annotated. In addition to the annotated toolmark images and the annotation tool, extracted toolmark patches are provided for training and testing to allow a quantitative comparison of the performance of different similarity measures. Finally, results from an evaluation using a publicly available state-of-the-art image descriptor based on deep learning are presented to provide a baseline for future publications.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w28/html/Sablatnig_FORMS-Locks_A_Dataset_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Manuel Keglevic; Robert Sablatnig
Face Detection, Bounding Box Aggregation and Pose Estimation for Robust Facial Landmark Localisation in the Wild	We present a framework for robust face detection and landmark localisation of faces in the wild, which has been evaluated as part of `the 2nd Facial Landmark Localisation Competition'. The framework has four stages: face detection, bounding box aggregation, pose estimation and landmark localisation. To achieve a high detection rate, we use two publicly available CNN-based face detectors and two proprietary detectors. We aggregate the detected face bounding boxes of each input image to reduce false positives and improve face detection accuracy. A cascaded shape regressor, trained using faces with a variety of pose variations, is then employed for pose estimation and image pre-processing. Last, we train the final cascaded shape regressor for fine-grained landmark localisation, using a large number of training samples with limited pose variations. The experimental results obtained on the 300W and Menpo benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework over state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w33/html/Feng_Face_Detection_Bounding_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhen-Hua Feng, Josef Kittler, Muhammad Awais, Patrik Huber, Xiao-Jun Wu
"Face Normals ""In-The-Wild"" Using Fully Convolutional Networks"	In this work we pursue a data-driven approach to the problem of estimating surface normals from a single intensity image, focusing in particular on human faces. We introduce new methods to exploit the currently available facial databases for dataset construction and tailor a deep convolutional neural network to the task of estimating facial surface normals `in-the-wild'. We train a fully convolutional network that can accurately recover facial normals from images including a challenging variety of expressions and facial poses. We compare against state-of-the-art face Shape-from-Shading and 3D reconstruction techniques and show that the proposed network can recover substantially more accurate and realistic normals. Furthermore, in contrast to other existing face-specific surface recovery methods, we do not require the solving of an explicit alignment step due to the fully convolutional nature of our network.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Trigeorgis_Face_Normals_In-The-Wild_CVPR_2017_paper.html	George Trigeorgis, Patrick Snape, Iasonas Kokkinos, Stefanos Zafeiriou
Face Presentation Attack Detection by Exploring Spectral Signatures	Presentation attack on the face recognition systems is well studied in the biometrics community resulting in various techniques for detecting the attacks. A low-cost presentation attack (e.g. print attacks) on face recognition systems has been demonstrated for systems operating in visible, multispectral (visible and near infrared spectrum) and extended multispectral (more than two spectral bands spanning from visible to near infrared space, commonly in 500nm-1000nm). In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect the presentation attacks on the extended multispectral face recognition systems. The proposed method is based on characterising the reflectance properties of the captured image through the spectral signature. The spectral signature is further classified using the linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) to obtain the decision on presented sample as an artefact or bona-fide. Since the reflectance property of the human skin and the artefact material differ, the proposed method can efficiently detect the presentation attacks on the extended multispectral system. Extensive experiments are carried out on a publicly available extended multispectral database (EMSPAD) comprised of 50 subjects with two different Presentation Attack Instrument (PAI) generated using two different printers. The comparison analysis is presented by comparing the performance of the proposed scheme with the contemporary schemes based on the image fusion and PAD score level fusion. Based on the obtained results, the proposed method has indicated the best performance in detecting both known and unknown attacks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w6/html/Raghavendra_Face_Presentation_Attack_CVPR_2017_paper.html	R.

Face Presentation Attack With Latex Masks in Multispectral Videos	Face recognition systems are susceptible to presentation attacks such as printed photo attacks, replay attacks, and 3D mask attacks. These attacks, primarily studied in visible spectrum, aim to obfuscate or impersonate a person's identity. This paper presents a unique multispectral video face database for face presentation attack using latex and paper masks. The proposed Multispectral Latex Mask based Video Face Presentation Attack (MLFP) database contains 1350 videos in visible, near infrared, and thermal spectrums. Since the database consists of videos of subjects without any mask as well as wearing ten different masks, the effect of identity concealment is analyzed in each spectrum using face recognition algorithms. We also present the performance of existing presentation attack detection algorithms on the proposed MLFP database. It is observed that the thermal imaging spectrum is most effective in detecting face presentation attacks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w3/html/Agarwal_Face_Presentation_Attack_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Akshay Agarwal, Daksha Yadav, Naman Kohli, Richa Singh, Mayank Vatsa, Afzel Noore
Face Recognition Performance Under Aging	With the integration of face recognition technology into important identity applications, it is imperative that the effects of facial aging on face recognition performance are thoroughly understood. As face recognition systems evolve and improve, they should be periodically re-evaluated on large-scale longitudinal face datasets. In our study, we evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art commercial off the shelf (COTS) face recognition systems on two large-scale longitudinal datasets of mugshots of repeat offenders. The largest of these two datasets has 147,784 images of 18,007 subjects with an average of 8 images per subject over an average time span of 8.5 years. We fit multilevel statistical models to genuine comparison scores (similarity between images of the same face) from the two COTS face matchers. This allows us to analyze the degradation in recognition performance due to elapsed time between a probe (query) and its enrollment (gallery) image. We account for face image quality to obtain a better estimate of trends due to aging, and analyze whether longitudinal trends in genuine scores differ by subject gender and race. Based on the results of our statistical model, we infer that the state-of-the-art COTS matchers can verify 99% of the subjects at a false accept rate (FAR) of 0.01% for up to 10.5 and 8.5 years of elapsed time. Beyond this time lapse of 8.5 years, there is a significant loss in face recognition accuracy. This study extends and confirms the findings of earlier longitudinal studies on face recognition.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w6/html/Deb_Face_Recognition_Performance_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Debayan Deb, Lacey Best-Rowden, Anil K.

Facial Affect Estimation in the Wild Using Deep Residual and Convolutional Networks	Automated affective computing in the wild is a challenging task in the field of computer vision. This paper presents three neural network-based methods proposed for the task of facial affect estimation submitted to the First Affect-in-the-Wild challenge. These methods are based on Inception-ResNet modules redesigned specifically for the task of facial affect estimation. These methods are: Shallow Inception-ResNet, Deep Inception-ResNet, and Inception-ResNet with LSTMs. These networks extract facial features in different scales and simultaneously estimate both the valence and arousal in each frame. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) rates of 0.4 and 0.3 are achieved for the valence and arousal respectively with corresponding Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) rates of 0.04 and 0.29 using Deep Inception-ResNet method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w33/html/Hasani_Facial_Affect_Estimation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Behzad Hasani, Mohammad H.

Facial Expression Recognition Using Enhanced Deep 3D Convolutional Neural Networks	Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown to outperform traditional methods in various visual recognition tasks including Facial Expression Recognition (FER). In spite of efforts made to improve the accuracy of FER systems using DNN, existing methods still are not generalizable enough in practical applications. This paper proposes a 3D Convolutional Neural Network method for FER in videos. This new network architecture consists of 3D Inception-ResNet layers followed by an LSTM unit that together extracts the spatial relations within facial images as well as the temporal relations between different frames in the video. Facial landmark points are also used as inputs to our network which emphasize on the importance of facial components rather than the facial regions that may not contribute significantly to generating facial expressions. Our proposed method is evaluated using four publicly available databases in subject-independent and cross-database tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w41/html/Mahoor_Facial_Expression_Recognition_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Behzad Hasani, Mohammad H.

Factorized Variational Autoencoders for Modeling Audience Reactions to Movies	Matrix and tensor factorization methods are often used for finding underlying low-dimensional patterns from noisy data. In this paper, we study non-linear tensor factoriza- tion methods based on deep variational autoencoders. Our approach is well-suited for settings where the relationship between the latent representation to be learned and the raw data representation is highly complex. We apply our ap- proach to a large dataset of facial expressions of movie- watching audiences (over 16 million faces). Our experi- ments show that compared to conventional linear factoriza- tion methods, our method achieves better reconstruction of the data, and further discovers interpretable latent factors.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Deng_Factorized_Variational_Autoencoders_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhiwei Deng, Rajitha Navarathna, Peter Carr, Stephan Mandt, Yisong Yue, Iain Matthews, Greg Mori
Fast 3D Reconstruction of Faces With Glasses	We present a method for the fast 3D face reconstruction of people wearing glasses. Our method explicitly and robustly models the case in which a face to be reconstructed is partially occluded by glasses. We propose a simple and generic model for glasses that copes with a wide variety of different shapes, colors and styles, without the need for any database or learning. Our algorithm is simple, fast and requires only small amounts of both memory and runtime resources, allowing for a fast interactive 3D reconstruction on commodity mobile phones. The thorough evaluation of our approach on synthetic and real data demonstrates superior reconstruction results due to the explicit modeling of glasses.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Maninchedda_Fast_3D_Reconstruction_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Fabio Maninchedda, Martin R.

Fast Boosting Based Detection Using Scale Invariant Multimodal Multiresolution Filtered Features	In this paper we propose a novel boosting-based sliding window solution for object detection which can keep up with the precision of the state-of-the art deep learning approaches, while being 10 to 100 times faster. The solution takes advantage of multisensorial perception and exploits information from color, motion and depth. We introduce multimodal multiresolution filtering of signal intensity, gradient magnitude and orientation channels, in order to capture structure at multiple scales and orientations. To achieve scale invariant classification features, we analyze the effect of scale change on features for different filter types and propose a correction scheme. To improve recognition we incorporate 2D and 3D context by generating spatial, geometric and symmetrical channels. Finally, we evaluate the proposed solution on multiple benchmarks for the detection of pedestrians, cars and bicyclists. We achieve competitive results at over 25 frames per second.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Costea_Fast_Boosting_Based_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Arthur Daniel Costea, Robert Varga, Sergiu Nedevschi
Fast External Denoising Using Pre-Learned Transformations	We introduce a new external denoising algorithm that utilizes pre-learned transformations to accelerate filter calculations during runtime. The proposed fast external denoising (FED) algorithm shares characteristics of the powerful Targeted Image Denoising (TID) and Expected Patch Log-Likelihood (EPLL) algorithms. By moving computationally demanding steps to an offline learning stage, the proposed approach aims to find a balance between processing speed and obtaining high quality denoising estimates. We evaluate FED on three datasets with targeted databases (text, face and license plates) and also on a set of generic images without a targeted database. We show that, like TID, the proposed approach is extremely effective when the transformations are learned using a targeted database. We also demonstrate that FED converges to competitive solutions faster than EPLL and is orders of magnitude faster than TID while providing comparable denoising performance.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w12/html/Parameswaran_Fast_External_Denoising_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shibin Parameswaran, Enming Luo, Charles-Alban Deledalle, Truong Q.

Fast Fourier Color Constancy	We present Fast Fourier Color Constancy (FFCC), a color constancy algorithm which solves illuminant estimation by reducing it to a spatial localization task on a torus. By operating in the frequency domain, FFCC produces lower error rates than the previous state-of-the-art by 13-20% while being 250-3000 times faster. This unconventional approach introduces challenges regarding aliasing, directional statistics, and preconditioning, which we address. By producing a complete posterior distribution over illuminants instead of a single illuminant estimate, FFCC enables better training techniques, an effective temporal smoothing technique, and richer methods for error analysis. Our implementation of FFCC runs at 700 frames per second on a mobile device, allowing it to be used as an accurate, real-time, temporally-coherent automatic white balance algorithm.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Barron_Fast_Fourier_Color_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jonathan T.

Fast Haze Removal for Nighttime Image Using Maximum Reflectance Prior	In this paper, we address a haze removal problem from a single nighttime image, even in the presence of varicolored and non-uniform illumination. The core idea lies in a novel maximum reflectance prior. We first introduce the nighttime hazy imaging model, which includes a local ambient illumination item in both direct attenuation term and scattering term. Then, we propose a simple but effective image prior, maximum reflectance prior, to estimate the varying ambient illumination. The maximum reflectance prior is based on a key observation: for most daytime haze-free image patches, each color channel has very high intensity at some pixels. For the nighttime haze image, the local maximum intensities at each color channel are mainly contributed by the ambient illumination. Therefore, we can directly estimate the ambient illumination and transmission map, and consequently restore a high quality haze-free image. Experimental results on various nighttime hazy images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In particular, our approach has the advantage of computational efficiency, which is 10-100 times faster than state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Fast_Haze_Removal_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jing Zhang, Yang Cao, Shuai Fang, Yu Kang, Chang Wen Chen
Fast Multi-Frame Stereo Scene Flow With Motion Segmentation	We propose a new multi-frame method for efficiently computing scene flow (dense depth and optical flow) and camera ego-motion for a dynamic scene observed from a moving stereo camera rig. Our technique also segments out moving objects from the rigid scene. In our method, we first estimate the disparity map and the 6-DOF camera motion using stereo matching and visual odometry. We then identify regions inconsistent with the estimated camera motion and compute per-pixel optical flow only at these regions. This flow proposal is fused with the camera motion-based flow proposal using fusion moves to obtain the final optical flow and motion segmentation. This unified framework benefits all four tasks -- stereo, optical flow, visual odometry and motion segmentation leading to overall higher accuracy and efficiency. Our method is currently ranked third on the KITTI 2015 scene flow benchmark. Furthermore, our CPU implementation runs in 2-3 seconds per frame which is 1-3 orders of magnitude faster than the top six methods. We also report a thorough evaluation on challenging Sintel sequences with fast camera and object motion, where our method consistently outperforms OSF [Menze2015], which is currently ranked second on the KITTI benchmark.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Taniai_Fast_Multi-Frame_Stereo_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tatsunori Taniai, Sudipta N.

Fast Neural Cell Detection Using Light-Weight SSD Neural Network	Identifying the lineage path of neural cells is critical for understanding the development of brain. Accurate neural cell detection is a crucial step to obtain reliable delineation of cell lineage. To solve this task, in this paper we present an efficient neural cell detection method based on SSD (single shot multibox detector) neural network model. Our method adapts the original SSD architecture and removes the unnecessary blocks, leading to a light-weight model. Moreover, we formulate the cell detection as a binary regression problem, which makes our model much simpler. Experimental results demonstrate that, with only a small training set, our method is able to accurately capture the neural cells under severe shape deformation in a fast way.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w8/html/Yi_Fast_Neural_Cell_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jingru Yi, Pengxiang Wu, Daniel J.

Fast Person Re-Identification via Cross-Camera Semantic Binary Transformation	Numerous methods have been proposed for person re-identification, most of which however neglect the matching efficiency. Recently, several hashing based approaches have been developed to make re-identification more scalable for large-scale gallery sets. Despite their efficiency, these works ignore cross-camera variations, which severely deteriorate the final matching accuracy. To address the above issues, we propose a novel hashing based method for fast person re-identification, namely Cross-camera Semantic Binary Transformation (CSBT). CSBT aims to transform original high-dimensional feature vectors into compact identity-preserving binary codes. To this end, CSBT first employs a subspace projection to mitigate cross-camera variations, by maximizing intra-person similarities and inter-person discrepancies. Subsequently, a binary coding scheme is proposed via seamlessly incorporating both the semantic pairwise relationships and local affinity information. Finally, a joint learning framework is proposed for simultaneous subspace projection learning and binary coding based on discrete alternating optimization. Experimental results on four benchmarks clearly demonstrate the superiority of CSBT over the state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chen_Fast_Person_Re-Identification_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jiaxin Chen, Yunhong Wang, Jie Qin, Li Liu, Ling Shao
Fast Simplex-HMM for One-Shot Learning Activity Recognition	The work presented in this paper deals with the challenging task of learning an activity class representation using a single sequence for training.

A dimensionality reduction of the features spaces based on a Maximum at Posteriori adaptation combined with a fast estimation of the optimal parameters in the Expectation Maximization algorithm are presented in this paper. As confirmed by the experimental results, these two modifications not only reduce the computational cost but also maintain the performance or even improve it. The process suitability is experimentally confirmed using the human activity datasets Weizmann, KTH and IXMAS and the gesture dataset ChaLearn.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w14/html/Rodriguez_Fast_Simplex-HMM_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mario Rodriguez, Carlos Orrite, Carlos Medrano, Dimitrios Makris
Fast Video Classification via Adaptive Cascading of Deep Models	"Recent advances have enabled ""oracle"" classifiers that can classify across many classes and input distributions with high accuracy without retraining. However, these classifiers are relatively heavyweight, so that applying them to classify video is costly. We show that day-to-day video exhibits highly skewed class distributions over the short term, and that these distributions can be classified by much simpler models. We formulate the problem of detecting the short-term skews online and exploiting models based on it as a new sequential decision making problem dubbed the Online Bandit Problem, and present a new algorithm to solve it. When applied to recognizing faces in TV shows and movies, we realize end-to-end classification speedups of 2.4-7.8x/2.6-11.2x (on GPU/CPU) relative to a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network, at competitive accuracy."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Shen_Fast_Video_Classification_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Haichen Shen, Seungyeop Han, Matthai Philipose, Arvind Krishnamurthy
Fast and Accurate Image Super-Resolution Using a Combined Loss	Recently, several methods for single image super-resolution(SISR) based on deep neural networks have obtained high performance with regard to reconstruction accuracy and computational performance. This paper details the methodology and results of the New Trends in Image Restoration and Enhancement (NTIRE) challenge. The task of this challenge is to restore rich details (high frequencies) in a high resolution image for a single low resolution input image based on a set of prior examples with low and corresponding high resolution images. The challenge has two tracks. We present a super-resolution (SR) method, which uses three losses assigned with different weights to be regarded as optimization target. Meanwhile, the residual blocks are also used for obtaining significant improvement in the evaluation. The final model consists of 9 weight layers with four residual blocks and reconstructs the low resolution image with three color channels simultaneously, which shows better performance on these two tracks and benchmark datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w12/html/Xu_Fast_and_Accurate_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jinchang Xu, Yu Zhao, Yuan Dong, Hongliang Bai
Fast, Accurate Thin-Structure Obstacle Detection for Autonomous Mobile Robots	Safety is paramount for mobile robotic platforms such as self-driving cars and unmanned aerial vehicles. This work is devoted to a task that is indispensable for safety yet was largely overlooked in the past -- detecting obstacles that are of very thin structures, such as wires, cables and tree branches. This is a challenging problem, as thin objects can be problematic for active sensors such as lidar and sonar and even for stereo cameras. In this work, we propose to use video sequences for thin obstacle detection. We represent obstacles with edges in the video frames, and reconstruct them in 3D using efficient edge-based visual odometry techniques. We provide both a monocular camera solution and a stereo camera solution. The former incorporates IMU data to solve scale ambiguity, while the latter enjoys a novel, purely vision-based solution. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed methods are fast and able to detect thin obstacles robustly and accurately under various conditions.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w4/html/Zhou_Fast_Accurate_Thin-Structure_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chen Zhou, Jiaolong Yang, Chunshui Zhao, Gang Hua
Fast-At: Fast Automatic Thumbnail Generation Using Deep Neural Networks	Fast-AT is an automatic thumbnail generation system based on deep neural networks. It is a fully-convolutional deep neural network, which learns specific filters for thumbnails of different sizes and aspect ratios. During inference, the appropriate filter is selected depending on the dimensions of the target thumbnail. Unlike most previous work, Fast-AT does not utilize saliency but addresses the problem directly. In addition, it eliminates the need to conduct region search over the saliency map. The model generalizes to thumbnails of different sizes including those with extreme aspect ratios and can generate thumbnails in real time. A data set of more than 70,000 thumbnail annotations was collected to train Fast-AT. We show competitive results in comparison to existing techniques.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Esmaeili_Fast-At_Fast_Automatic_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Seyed A.

FastMask: Segment Multi-Scale Object Candidates in One Shot	Objects appear to scale differently in natural images. This fact requires methods dealing with object-centric tasks (e.g. object proposal) to have robust performance over variances in object scales. In the paper, we present a novel segment proposal framework, namely FastMask, which takes advantage of hierarchical features in deep convolutional neural networks to segment multi-scale objects in one shot. Innovatively, we adapt segment proposal network into three different functional components (body, neck and head). We further propose a weight-shared residual neck module as well as a scale-tolerant attentional head module for efficient one-shot inference. On MS COCO benchmark, the proposed FastMask outperforms all state-of-the-art segment proposal methods in average recall being 2 5 times faster. Moreover, with a slight trade-off in accuracy, FastMask can segment objects in near real time ( 13 fps) with 800*600 resolution images, demonstrating its potential in practical applications.

Feature Pyramid Networks for Object Detection	Feature pyramids are a basic component in recognition systems for detecting objects at different scales. But pyramid representations have been avoided in recent object detectors that are based on deep convolutional networks, partially because they are slow to compute and memory intensive. In this paper, we exploit the inherent multi-scale, pyramidal hierarchy of deep convolutional networks to construct feature pyramids with marginal extra cost. A top-down architecture with lateral connections is developed for building high-level semantic feature maps at all scales. This architecture, called a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), shows significant improvement as a generic feature extractor in several applications. Using a basic Faster R-CNN system, our method achieves state-of-the-art single-model results on the COCO detection benchmark without bells and whistles, surpassing all existing single-model entries including those from the COCO 2016 challenge winners. In addition, our method can run at 5 FPS on a GPU and thus is a practical and accurate solution to multi-scale object detection. Code will be made publicly available.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lin_Feature_Pyramid_Networks_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tsung-Yi Lin, Piotr Dollar, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He, Bharath Hariharan, Serge Belongie
Feedback Networks	urrently, the most successful learning models in computer vision are based on learning successive representations followed by a decision layer. This is usually actualized through feedforward multilayer neural networks, e.g. ConvNets, where each layer forms one of such successive representations. However, an alternative that can achieve the same goal is a feedback based approach in which the representation is formed in an iterative manner based on a feedback received from previous iteration's output. We establish that a feedback based approach has several core advantages over feedforward: it enables making early predictions at the query time, its output naturally conforms to a hierarchical structure in the label space (e.g. a taxonomy), and it provides a new basis for Curriculum Learning. We observe that feedback develops a considerably different representation compared to feedforward counterparts, in line with the aforementioned advantages. We provide a general feedback based learning architecture, instantiated using existing RNNs, with the endpoint results on par or better than existing feedforward networks and the addition of the above advantages.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zamir_Feedback_Networks_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Amir R.

Few-Shot Object Recognition From Machine-Labeled Web Images	"With the tremendous advances made by Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) on object recognition, we can now easily obtain adequately reliable machine-labeled annotations easily from predictions by off-the-shelf ConvNets. In this work, we present an ""abstraction memory"" based framework for few-shot learning, building upon machine-labeled image annotations. Our method takes large-scale machine-annotated dataset (e.g., OpenImages) as an external memory bank. In the external memory bank, the information is stored in the memory slots in the form of key-value, in which image feature is regarded as the key and the label embedding serves as the value. When queried by the few-shot examples, our model selects visually similar data from the external memory bank and writes the useful information obtained from related external data into another memory bank, i.e., abstraction memory. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) controllers and attention mechanisms are utilized to guarantee the data written to the abstraction memory correlates with the query example. The abstraction memory concentrates information from the external memory bank to make the few-shot recognition effective. In the experiments, we first confirm that our model can learn to conduct few-shot object recognition on clean human-labeled data from the ImageNet dataset. Then, we demonstrate that with our model, machine-labeled image annotations are very effective and abundant resources for performing object recognition on novel categories. Experimental results show that our proposed model with machine-labeled annotations achieves great results, with only a 1% difference in accuracy between the machine-labeled annotations and the human-labeled annotations."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xu_Few-Shot_Object_Recognition_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhongwen Xu, Linchao Zhu, Yi Yang
Filmy Cloud Removal on Satellite Imagery With Multispectral Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets	This paper proposes a method for cloud removal from visible light RGB satellite images by extending the conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) from RGB images to multispectral images. The networks are trained to output images that are close to the ground truth with the input images synthesized with clouds on the ground truth images. In the available dataset, the ratio of images of the forest or the sea is very high, which will cause bias of the training dataset if we uniformly sample from the dataset. Thus, we utilize the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to improve the bias problem of the training dataset. Finally, we confirm the feasibility of the proposed networks on the dataset of 4 bands images including three visible light bands and one near-infrared (NIR) band.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w18/html/Enomoto_Filmy_Cloud_Removal_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Kenji Enomoto, Ken Sakurada, Weimin Wang, Hiroshi Fukui, Masashi Matsuoka, Ryosuke Nakamura, Nobuo Kawaguchi
Filter Flow Made Practical: Massively Parallel and Lock-Free	"This paper is inspired by a relatively recent work of Seitz and Baker which introduced the so-called Filter Flow model. Filter flow finds the transformation relating a pair of (or multiple) images by identifying a large set of local linear filters; imposing additional constraints on certain structural properties of these filters enables Filter Flow to serve as a general ""one stop"" construction for a spectrum of problems in vision: from optical flow to defocus to stereo to affine alignment. The idea is beautiful yet the benefits are not borne out in practice because of significant computational challenges. This issue makes most (if not all) deployments for practical vision problems out of reach. The key thrust of our work is to identify mathematically (near) equivalent reformulations of this model that can eliminate this serious limitation. We demonstrate via a detailed optimization-focused development that Filter Flow can indeed be solved fairly efficiently for a wide range of instantiations. We derive efficient algorithms, perform extensive theoretical analysis focused on convergence and parallelization and show how results competitive with the state of the art for many applications can be achieved with negligible application specific adjustments or post-processing. The actual numerical scheme is easy to understand and, implement (30 lines in Matlab) -- this development will enable Filter Flow to be a viable general solver and testbed for numerous applications in the community, going forward."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ravi_Filter_Flow_Made_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Sathya N.

Finding Anomalies With Generative Adversarial Networks for a Patrolbot	We present an anomaly detection system based on an autonomous robot performing a patrol task. Using a generative adversarial network (GAN), we compare the robot's current view with a learned model of normality.

Finding Tiny Faces	Though tremendous strides have been made in object recognition, one of the remaining open challenges is detecting small objects. We explore three aspects of the problem in the context of finding small faces: the role of scale invariance, image resolution, and contextual reasoning. While most recognition approaches aim to be scale-invariant, the cues for recognizing a 3px tall face are fundamentally different than those for recognizing a 300px tall face. We take a different approach and train separate detectors for different scales. To maintain efficiency, detectors are trained in a multi-task fashion: they make use of features extracted from multiple layers of single (deep) feature hierarchy. While training detectors for large objects is straightforward, the crucial challenge remains training detectors for small objects. We show that context is crucial, and define templates that make use of massively-large receptive fields (where 99% of the template extends beyond the object of interest). Finally, we explore the role of scale in pre-trained deep networks, providing ways to extrapolate networks tuned for limited scales to rather extreme ranges. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on massively-benchmarked face datasets (FDDB and WIDER FACE). In particular, when compared to prior art on WIDER FACE, our results reduce error by a factor of 2 (our models produce an AP of 82% while prior art ranges from 29-64%).	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Hu_Finding_Tiny_Faces_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Peiyun Hu, Deva Ramanan
Fine-Grained Image Classification via Combining Vision and Language	Fine-grained image classification is a challenging task due to the large intra-class variance and small inter-class variance, aiming at recognizing hundreds of sub-categories belonging to the same basic-level category. Most existing fine-grained image classification methods generally learn part detection models to obtain the semantic parts for better classification accuracy. Despite achieving promising results, these methods mainly have two limitations: (1) not all the parts which obtained through the part detection models are beneficial and indispensable for classification, and (2) fine-grained image classification requires more detailed visual descriptions which could not be provided by the part locations or attribute annotations. For addressing the above two limitations, this paper proposes the two-stream model combing vision and language (CVL) for learning latent semantic representations. The vision stream learns deep representations from the original visual information via deep convolutional neural network. The language stream utilizes the natural language descriptions which could point out the discriminative parts or characteristics for each image, and provides a flexible and compact way of encoding the salient visual aspects for distinguishing sub-categories. Since the two streams are complementary, combing the two streams can further achieves better classification accuracy. Comparing with 12 state-of-the-art methods on the widely used CUB-200-2011 dataset for fine-grained image classification, the experimental results demonstrate our CVL approach achieves the best performance.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/He_Fine-Grained_Image_Classification_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xiangteng He, Yuxin Peng
Fine-Grained Recognition as HSnet Search for Informative Image Parts	"This work addresses fine-grained image classification. Our work is based on the hypothesis that when dealing with subtle differences among object classes it is critical to identify and only account for a few informative image parts, as the remaining image context may not only be uninformative but may also hurt recognition. This motivates us to formulate our problem as a sequential search for informative parts over a deep feature map produced by a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A state of this search is a set of proposal bounding boxes in the image, whose ""informativeness"" is evaluated by the heuristic function (H), and used for generating new candidate states by the successor function (S). The two functions are unified via a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) into a new deep recurrent architecture, called HSnet. Thus, HSnet (i) generates proposals of informative image parts and (ii) fuses all proposals toward final fine-grained recognition. We specify both supervised and weakly supervised training of HSnet depending on the availability of object part annotations. Evaluation on the benchmark Caltech-UCSD Birds 200-2011 and Cars-196 datasets demonstrate our competitive performance relative to the state of the art."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lam_Fine-Grained_Recognition_as_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Michael Lam, Behrooz Mahasseni, Sinisa Todorovic
Fine-Grained Recognition of Thousands of Object Categories With Single-Example Training	We approach the problem of fast detection and recognition of a large number (thousands) of object categories while training on a very limited amount of examples, usually one per category. Examples of this task include: (i) detection of retail products, where we have only one studio image of each product available for training; (ii) detection of brand logos; and (iii) detection of 3D objects and their respective poses within a static 2D image, where only a sparse subset of (partial) object views is available for training, with a single example for each view. Building a detector based on so few examples presents a significant challenge for the current top-performing (deep) learning based techniques, which require large amounts of data to train. Our approach for this task is based on a non-parametric probabilistic model for initial detection, CNN-based refinement and temporal integration where applicable. We successfully demonstrate its usefulness in a variety of experiments on both existing and our own benchmarks achieving state-of-the-art performance.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Karlinsky_Fine-Grained_Recognition_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Leonid Karlinsky, Joseph Shtok, Yochay Tzur, Asaf Tzadok
Fine-To-Coarse Global Registration of RGB-D Scans	"RGB-D scanning of indoor environments is important for many applications, including real estate, interior design, and virtual reality. However, it is still challenging to register RGB-D images from a hand-held camera over a long video sequence into a globally consistent 3D model. Current methods often can lose tracking or drift and thus fail to reconstruct salient structures in large environments (e.g., parallel walls in different rooms). To address this problem, we propose a ""fine-to-coarse"" global registration algorithm that leverages robust registrations at finer scales to seed detection and enforcement of new correspondence and structural constraints at coarser scales. To test global registration algorithms, we provide a benchmark with 10,401 manually-clicked point correspondences in 25 scenes from the SUN3D dataset. During experiments with this benchmark, we find that our fine-to-coarse algorithm registers long RGB-D sequences better than previous methods."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Halber_Fine-To-Coarse_Global_Registration_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser
Fine-Tuning Convolutional Neural Networks for Biomedical Image Analysis: Actively and Incrementally	"Intense interest in applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in biomedical image analysis is wide spread, but its success is impeded by the lack of large annotated datasets in biomedical imaging. Annotating biomedical images is not only tedious and time consuming, but also demanding of costly, specialty - oriented knowledge and skills, which are not easily accessible. To dramatically reduce annotation cost, this paper presents a novel method called AIFT (active, incremental fine-tuning) to naturally integrate active learning and transfer learning into a single framework. AIFT starts directly with a pre-trained CNN to seek ""worthy"" samples from the unannotated for annotation, and the (fine-tuned) CNN is further fine-tuned continuously by incorporating newly annotated samples in each iteration to enhance the CNN's performance incrementally. We have evaluated our method in three different biomedical imaging applications, demonstrating that the cost of annotation can be cut by at least half. This performance is attributed to the several advantages derived from the advanced active and incremental capability of our AIFT method."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhou_Fine-Tuning_Convolutional_Neural_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zongwei Zhou, Jae Shin, Lei Zhang, Suryakanth Gurudu, Michael Gotway, Jianming Liang
Fixation Prediction in Videos Using Unsupervised Hierarchical Features	This paper presents a framework for saliency estimation and fixation prediction in videos. The proposed framework is based on a hierarchical feature representation obtained by stacking convolutional layers of independent subspace analysis (ISA) filters. The feature learning is thus unsupervised and independent of the task. To compute the saliency, we then employ a multiresolution saliency architecture that exploits both local and global saliency. That is, for a given image, an image pyramid is initially built. After that, for each resolution, both local and global saliency measures are computed to obtain a saliency map. The integration of saliency maps over the image pyramid provides the final video saliency. We first show that combining local and global saliency improves the results. We then compare the proposed model with several video saliency models and demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of predicting video saliency effectively, outperforming all the other models.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w37/html/Wang_Fixation_Prediction_in_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Julius Wang, Hamed R.

Fixed-Point Factorized Networks	In recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) based methods have achieved remarkable performance in a wide range of tasks and have been among the most powerful and widely used techniques in computer vision. However, DNN-based methods are both computational-intensive and resource-consuming, which hinders the application of these methods on embedded systems like smart phones. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a novel Fixed-point Factorized Networks (FFN) for pretrained models to reduce the computational complexity as well as the storage requirement of networks. The resulting networks have only weights of -1, 0 and 1, which significantly eliminates the most resource-consuming multiply-accumulate operations (MACs). Extensive experiments on large-scale ImageNet classification task show the proposed FFN only requires one-thousandth of multiply operations with comparable accuracy.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_Fixed-Point_Factorized_Networks_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Peisong Wang, Jian Cheng
Flexible Spatio-Temporal Networks for Video Prediction	We describe a modular framework for video frame prediction. We refer to it as a Flexible Spatio-Temporal Network (FSTN) as it allows the extrapolation of a video sequence as well as the estimation of synthetic frames lying in between observed frames and thus the generation of slow-motion videos. By devising a customized objective function comprising decoding, encoding, and adversarial losses, we are able to mitigate the common problem of blurry predictions, managing to retain high frequency information even for relatively distant future predictions. We propose and analyse different training strategies to optimize our model. Extensive experiments on several challenging public datasets demonstrate both the versatility and validity of our model.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lu_Flexible_Spatio-Temporal_Networks_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chaochao Lu, Michael Hirsch, Bernhard Scholkopf
Flight Dynamics-Based Recovery of a UAV Trajectory Using Ground Cameras	We propose a new method to estimate the 6-dof trajectory of a flying object such as a quadrotor UAV within a 3D airspace monitored using multiple fixed ground cameras. It is based on a new structure from motion formulation for the 3D reconstruction of a single moving point with known motion dynamics. Our main contribution is a new bundle adjustment procedure, which in addition to optimizing the camera poses, regularizes the point trajectory using a prior based on motion dynamics (or specifically flight dynamics). Furthermore, we can infer the underlying control input sent to the UAV's autopilot that determined its flight trajectory. Our method requires neither perfect single-view tracking nor appearance matching across views. For robustness, we allow the tracker to generate multiple detections per frame in each video. The true detections and the data association across videos is estimated using robust multi-view triangulation and subsequently refined in our bundle adjustment formulation. Quantitative evaluation on simulated data and experiments on real videos from indoor and outdoor scenes shows that our technique is superior to existing methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Rozantsev_Flight_Dynamics-Based_Recovery_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Artem Rozantsev, Sudipta N.

FlowNet 2.0: Evolution of Optical Flow Estimation With Deep Networks	The FlowNet demonstrated that optical flow estimation can be cast as a learning problem. However, the state of the art with regard to the quality of the flow has still been defined by traditional methods. Particularly on small displacements and real-world data, FlowNet cannot compete with variational methods. In this paper, we advance the concept of end-to-end learning of optical flow and make it work really well. The large improvements in quality and speed are caused by three major contributions: first, we focus on the training data and show that the schedule of presenting data during training is very important. Second, we develop a stacked architecture that includes warping of the second image with intermediate optical flow. Third, we elaborate on small displacements by introducing a subnetwork specializing on small motions. FlowNet 2.0 is only marginally slower than the original FlowNet but decreases the estimation error by more than 50%. It performs on par with state-of-the-art methods, while running at interactive frame rates. Moreover, we present faster variants that allow optical flow computation at up to 140fps with accuracy matching the original FlowNet.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ilg_FlowNet_2.0_Evolution_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Eddy Ilg, Nikolaus Mayer, Tonmoy Saikia, Margret Keuper, Alexey Dosovitskiy, Thomas Brox
Football Action Recognition Using Hierarchical LSTM	We present a hierarchical recurrent network for understanding team sports activity in image and location sequences. In the hierarchical model, we integrate proposed multiple person-centered features over a temporal sequence based on LSTM's outputs. To achieve this scheme, we introduce the Keeping state in LSTM as one of externally controllable states, and extend the Hierarchical LSTMs to include mechanism for the integration. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed framework involving hierarchical LSTM and person-centered feature. In this study, we demonstrate improvement over the reference model. Specifically, by incorporating the person-centered feature with meta-information (e.g., location data) in our proposed late fusion framework, we also demonstrate increased discriminability of action categories and enhanced robustness against fluctuation in the number of observed players.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w2/html/Tsunoda_Football_Action_Recognition_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Takamasa Tsunoda, Yasuhiro Komori, Masakazu Matsugu, Tatsuya Harada
Forecasting Human Dynamics From Static Images	This paper presents the first study on forecasting human dynamics from static images. The problem is to input a single RGB image and generate a sequence of upcoming human body poses in 3D. To address the problem, we propose the 3D Pose Forecasting Network (3D-PFNet). Our 3D-PFNet integrates recent advances on single-image human pose estimation and sequence prediction, and converts the 2D predictions into 3D space. We train our 3D-PFNet using a three-step training strategy to leverage a diverse source of training data, including image and video based human pose datasets and 3D motion capture (MoCap) data. We demonstrate competitive performance of our 3D-PFNet on 2D pose forecasting and 3D structure recovery through quantitative and qualitative results.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chao_Forecasting_Human_Dynamics_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yu-Wei Chao, Jimei Yang, Brian Price, Scott Cohen, Jia Deng
Forecasting Interactive Dynamics of Pedestrians With Fictitious Play	We develop predictive models of pedestrian dynamics by encoding the coupled nature of multi-pedestrian interaction using game theory and deep learning-based visual analysis to estimate person-specific behavior parameters. We focus on predictive models since they are important for developing interactive autonomous systems (e.g., autonomous cars, home robots, smart homes) that can understand different human behavior and pre-emptively respond to future human actions. Building predictive models for multi-pedestrian interactions however, is very challenging due to two reasons: (1) the dynamics of interaction are complex interdependent processes, where the decision of one person can affect others; and (2) dynamics are variable, where each person may behave differently (e.g., an older person may walk slowly while the younger person may walk faster). To address these challenges, we utilize concepts from game theory to model the intertwined decision making process of multiple pedestrians and use visual classifiers to learn a mapping from pedestrian appearance to behavior parameters. We evaluate our proposed model on several public multiple pedestrian interaction video datasets. Results show that our strategic planning model predicts and explains human interactions 25% better when compared to a state-of-the-art activity forecasting method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ma_Forecasting_Interactive_Dynamics_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Wei-Chiu Ma, De-An Huang, Namhoon Lee, Kris M.

FormResNet: Formatted Residual Learning for Image Restoration	"In this paper, we propose a deep CNN to tackle the image restoration problem by learning the structured residual. Previous deep learning based methods directly learn the mapping from corrupted images to clean images, and may suffer from the gradient exploding/vanishing problems of deep neural networks. We propose to address the image restoration problem by learning the structured details and recovering the latent clean image together, from the shared information between the corrupted image and the latent image. In addition, instead of learning the pure difference (corruption), we propose to add a ""residual formatting layer"" to format the residual to structured information, which allows the network to converge faster and boosts the performance. Furthermore, we propose a cross-level loss net to ensure both pixel-level accuracy and semantic-level visual quality. Evaluations on public datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches quantitatively and qualitatively."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w12/html/Jiao_FormResNet_Formatted_Residual_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jianbo Jiao, Wei-Chih Tu, Shengfeng He, Rynson W.

Fractal Dimension Invariant Filtering and Its CNN-Based Implementation	Fractal analysis has been widely used in computer vision, especially in texture image processing and texture analysis. The key concept of fractal-based image model is the fractal dimension, which is invariant to bi-Lipschitz transformation of image, and thus capable of representing intrinsic structural information of image robustly. However, the invariance of fractal dimension generally does not hold after filtering, which limits the application of fractal-based image model. In this paper, we propose a novel fractal dimension invariant filtering (FDIF) method, extending the invariance of fractal dimension to filtering operations. Utilizing the notion of local self-similarity, we first develop a local fractal model for images. By adding a nonlinear post-processing step behind anisotropic filter banks, we demonstrate that the proposed filtering method is capable of preserving the local invariance of the fractal dimension of image. Meanwhile, we show that the FDIF method can be re-instantiated approximately via a CNN-based architecture, where the convolution layer extracts anisotropic structure of image and the nonlinear layer enhances the structure via preserving local fractal dimension of image. The proposed filtering method provides us with a novel geometric interpretation of CNN-based image model. Focusing on a challenging image processing task --- detecting complicated curves from the texture-like images, the proposed method obtains superior results to the state-of-art approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xu_Fractal_Dimension_Invariant_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hongteng Xu, Junchi Yan, Nils Persson, Weiyao Lin, Hongyuan Zha
Fried Binary Embedding for High-Dimensional Visual Features	Most existing binary embedding methods prefer compact binary codes (b-dimensional) to avoid high computational and memory cost of projecting high-dimensional visual features (d-dimensional, b < d). We argue that long binary codes (b O(d)) are critical to fully utilize the discriminative power of high-dimensional visual features, and can achieve better results in various tasks such as approximate nearest neighbour search. Generating long binary codes involves large projection matrix and high-dimensional matrix-vector multiplication, thus is memory and compute intensive. To tackle these problems, we propose Fried Binary Embedding (FBE) to decompose the projection matrix using adaptive Fastfood transform, which is the multiplication of several structured matrices. As a result, FBE can reduce the computational complexity from O(d2) to O(dlogd), and memory cost from O(d2) to O(d), respectively. More importantly, by using the structured matrices, FBE can regulate the projection matrix against over-fitting and lead to even better accuracy than using unconstrained projection matrix (like ITQ [4]) with the same long code length. Experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art methods over various visual applications demonstrate both the efficiency and performance advantages of the FBE.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Hong_Fried_Binary_Embedding_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Weixiang Hong, Junsong Yuan, Sreyasee Das Bhattacharjee
From Local to Global: Edge Profiles to Camera Motion in Blurred Images	In this work, we investigate the relation between the edge profiles present in a motion blurred image and the underlying camera motion responsible for causing the motion blur. While related works on camera motion estimation (CME) rely on the strong assumption of space-invariant blur, we handle the challenging case of general camera motion. We first show how edge profiles `alone' can be harnessed to perform direct CME from a single observation. While it is routine for conventional methods to jointly estimate the latent image too through alternating minimization, our above scheme is best-suited when such a pursuit is either impractical or inefficacious. For applications that actually favor an alternating minimization strategy, the edge profiles can serve as a valuable cue. We incorporate a suitably derived constraint from edge profiles into an existing blind deblurring framework and demonstrate improved restoration performance. Experiments reveal that this approach yields state-of-the-art results for the blind deblurring problem.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Vasu_From_Local_to_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Subeesh Vasu, A.

From Motion Blur to Motion Flow: A Deep Learning Solution for Removing Heterogeneous Motion Blur	Removing pixel-wise heterogeneous motion blur is challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. The predominant solution is to estimate the blur kernel by adding a prior, but extensive literature on the subject indicates the difficulty in identifying a prior which is suitably informative, and general. Rather than imposing a prior based on theory, we propose instead to learn one from the data. Learning a prior over the latent image would require modeling all possible image content. The critical observation underpinning our approach, however, is that learning the motion flow instead allows the model to focus on the cause of the blur, irrespective of the image content. This is a much easier learning task, but it also avoids the iterative process through which latent image priors are typically applied. Our approach directly estimates the motion flow from the blurred image through a fully-convolutional deep neural network (FCN) and recovers the unblurred image from the estimated motion flow. Our FCN is the first universal end-to-end mapping from the blurred image to the dense motion flow. To train the FCN, we simulate motion flows to generate synthetic blurred-image-motion-flow pairs thus avoiding the need for human labeling. Extensive experiments on challenging realistic blurred images demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Gong_From_Motion_Blur_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Dong Gong, Jie Yang, Lingqiao Liu, Yanning Zhang, Ian Reid, Chunhua Shen, Anton van den Hengel, Qinfeng Shi
From Red Wine to Red Tomato: Composition With Context	Compositionality and contextuality are key building blocks of intelligence. They allow us to compose known concepts to generate new and complex ones. However, traditional learning methods do not model both these properties and require copious amounts of labeled data to learn new concepts. A large fraction of existing techniques, e.g., using late fusion, compose concepts but fail to model contextuality. For example, red in red wine is different from red in red tomatoes. In this paper, we present a simple method that respects contextuality in order to compose classifiers of known visual concepts. Our method builds upon the intuition that classifiers lie in a smooth space where compositional transforms can be modeled. We show how it can generalize to unseen combinations of concepts. Our results on composing attributes, objects as well as composing subject, predicate, and objects demonstrate its strong generalization performance compared to baselines. Finally, we present detailed analysis of our method and highlight its properties.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Misra_From_Red_Wine_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ishan Misra, Abhinav Gupta, Martial Hebert
From Zero-Shot Learning to Conventional Supervised Classification: Unseen Visual Data Synthesis	Robust object recognition systems usually rely on powerful feature extraction mechanisms from a large number of real images. However, in many realistic applications, collecting sufficient images for ever-growing new classes is unattainable. In this paper, we propose a new Zero-shot learning (ZSL) framework that can synthesise visual features for unseen classes without acquiring real images. Using the proposed Unseen Visual Data Synthesis (UVDS) algorithm, semantic attributes are effectively utilised as an intermediate clue to synthesise unseen visual features at the training stage. Hereafter, ZSL recognition is converted into the conventional supervised problem, i.e. the synthesised visual features can be straightforwardly fed to typical classifiers such as SVM. On four benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the benefit of using synthesised unseen data. Extensive experimental results manifest that our proposed approach significantly improve the state-of-the-art results.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Long_From_Zero-Shot_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yang Long, Li Liu, Ling Shao, Fumin Shen, Guiguang Ding, Jungong Han
Full BRDF Reconstruction Using CNNs From Partial Photometric Stereo-Light Field Data	The acquisition of partial BRDF measurements using light field cameras and several illumination directions raises critical questions regarding the accuracy of inferences based on that data. Therefore, we attempt to verify the quality of the reconstruction of a full BRDF using partial input data. A dataset that provides a densely sampled BRDF was used, both in viewing and illumination directions. We show the reconstruction of dense BRDFs when the viewing angles are limited to top central regions, while the illumination angles are not reduced and are positioned in the shape of a half sphere around the material object, these properties are characteristic of data provided by plenoptic cameras paired with a photometric light dome. The partial reconstruction of the dense BRDF out of data is achieved by utilizing convolutional neural networks. We obtain a competitive full reconstruction when up to 2/3 of the BRDF is unknown.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w27/html/Antensteiner_Full_BRDF_Reconstruction_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Doris Antensteiner, Svorad Stolc

We compare RNN types (LSTM, associative LSTM) and introduce a new hybrid of GRU and ResNet. We also study ""one-shot"" versus additive reconstruction architectures and introduce a new scaled-additive framework. We compare to previous work, showing improvements of 4.3%-8.8% AUC (area under the rate-distortion curve), depending on the perceptual metric used.

Full-Resolution Residual Networks for Semantic Segmentation in Street Scenes	Semantic image segmentation is an essential component of modern autonomous driving systems, as an accurate understanding of the surrounding scene is crucial to navigation and action planning. Current state-of-the-art approaches in semantic image segmentation rely on pre-trained networks that were initially developed for classifying images as a whole. While these networks exhibit outstanding recognition performance (i.e., what is visible?), they lack localization accuracy (i.e., where precisely is something located?). Therefore, additional processing steps have to be performed in order to obtain pixel-accurate segmentation masks at the full image resolution. To alleviate this problem we propose a novel ResNet-like architecture that exhibits strong localization and recognition performance. We combine multi-scale context with pixel-level accuracy by using two processing streams within our network: One stream carries information at the full image resolution, enabling precise adherence to segment boundaries. The other stream undergoes a sequence of pooling operations to obtain robust features for recognition. The two streams are coupled at the full image resolution using residuals. Without additional processing steps and without pre-training, our approach achieves an intersection-over-union score of 71.8% on the Cityscapes dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Pohlen_Full-Resolution_Residual_Networks_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tobias Pohlen, Alexander Hermans, Markus Mathias, Bastian Leibe

Fully Convolutional Region Proposal Networks for Multispectral Person Detection	Multispectral images that combine visual-optical and infrared image information are a promising source of data for automatic person detection. Especially in automotive or surveillance applications, challenging conditions such as insufficient illumination or large distances between camera and object occur regularly and can affect image quality. This leads to weak image contrast or low object resolution. In order to detect persons under such conditions, we apply deep learning for fusing the VIS and IR information in multispectral images. We present a novel multispectral Region Proposal Network that is built up on the pre-trained very deep convolutional network VGG-16. The proposals of this network are evaluated using a Boosted Decision Trees classifier in order to reduce potential false positive detections. With a log-average miss rate of 29.83% on the reasonable test set of the KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Detection Benchmark, we improve the current state-of-the-art by about 18%.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w3/html/Konig_Fully_Convolutional_Region_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Daniel Konig, Michael Adam, Christian Jarvers, Georg Layher, Heiko Neumann, Michael Teutsch
Fully-Adaptive Feature Sharing in Multi-Task Networks With Applications in Person Attribute Classification	Multi-task learning aims to improve generalization performance of multiple prediction tasks by appropriately sharing relevant information across them. In the context of deep neural networks, this idea is often realized by hand-designed network architectures with layers that are shared across tasks and branches that encode task-specific features. However, the space of possible multi-task deep architectures is combinatorially large and often the final architecture is arrived at by manual exploration of this space, which can be both error-prone and tedious. We propose an automatic approach for designing compact multi-task deep learning architectures. Our approach starts with a thin multi-layer network and dynamically widens it in a greedy manner during training. By doing so iteratively, it creates a tree-like deep architecture, on which similar tasks reside in the same branch until at the top layers. Evaluation on person attributes classification tasks involving facial and clothing attributes suggests that the models produced by the proposed method are fast, compact and can closely match or exceed the state-of-the-art accuracy from strong baselines by much more expensive models.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lu_Fully-Adaptive_Feature_Sharing_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yongxi Lu, Abhishek Kumar, Shuangfei Zhai, Yu Cheng, Tara Javidi, Rogerio Feris
FusionSeg: Learning to Combine Motion and Appearance for Fully Automatic Segmentation of Generic Objects in Videos	We propose an end-to-end learning framework for segmenting generic objects in videos. Our method learns to combine appearance and motion information to produce pixel level segmentation masks for all prominent objects in videos. We formulate this task as a structured prediction problem and design a two-stream fully convolutional neural network which fuses together motion and appearance in a unified framework. Since large-scale video datasets with pixel level segmentations are problematic, we show how to bootstrap weakly annotated videos together with existing image recognition datasets for training. Through experiments on three challenging video segmentation benchmarks, our method substantially improves the state-of-the-art for segmenting generic (unseen) objects. Code and pre-trained models are available on the project website.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Jain_FusionSeg_Learning_to_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Suyog Dutt Jain, Bo Xiong, Kristen Grauman
G2DeNet: Global Gaussian Distribution Embedding Network and Its Application to Visual Recognition	Recently, plugging trainable structural layers into deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as image representations has made promising progress. However, there has been little work on inserting parametric probability distributions, which can effectively model feature statistics, into deep CNNs in an end-to-end manner. This paper proposes a Global Gaussian Distribution embedding Network (G2DeNet) to take a step towards addressing this problem. The core of G2DeNet is a novel trainable layer of a global Gaussian as an image representation plugged into deep CNNs for end-to-end learning. The challenge is that the proposed layer involves Gaussian distributions whose space is not a linear space, which makes its forward and backward propagations be non-intuitive and non-trivial. To tackle this issue, we employ a Gaussian embedding strategy which respects the structures of both Riemannian manifold and smooth group of Gaussians. Based on this strategy, we construct the proposed global Gaussian embedding layer and decompose it into two sub-layers: the matrix partition sub-layer decoupling the mean vector and covariance matrix entangled in the embedding matrix, and the square-rooted, symmetric positive definite matrix sub-layer. In this way, we can derive the partial derivatives associated with the proposed structural layer and thus allow backpropagation of gradients. Experimental results on large scale region classification and fine-grained recognition tasks show that G2DeNet is superior to its counterparts, capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_G2DeNet_Global_Gaussian_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Qilong Wang, Peihua Li, Lei Zhang
GMS: Grid-based Motion Statistics for Fast, Ultra-Robust Feature Correspondence	Incorporating smoothness constraints into feature matching is known to enable ultra-robust matching. However, such formulations are both complex and slow, making them unsuitable for video applications. This paper proposes GMS (Grid-based Motion Statistics), a simple means of encapsulating motion smoothness as the statistical likelihood of a certain number of matches in a region. GMS enables translation of high match numbers into high match quality. This provides a real-time, ultra-robust correspondence system. Evaluation on videos, with low textures, blurs and wide-baselines show GMS consistently out-performs other real-time matchers and can achieve parity with more sophisticated, much slower techniques.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Bian_GMS_Grid-based_Motion_CVPR_2017_paper.html	JiaWang Bian, Wen-Yan Lin, Yasuyuki Matsushita, Sai-Kit Yeung, Tan-Dat Nguyen, Ming-Ming Cheng
GaitGAN: Invariant Gait Feature Extraction Using Generative Adversarial Networks	The performance of gait recognition can be adversely affected by many sources of variation such as view angle, clothing, presence of and type of bag, posture, and occlusion, among others. In order to extract invariant gait features, we proposed a method named as GaitGAN which is based on generative adversarial networks (GAN). In the proposed method, a GAN model is taken as a regressor to generate invariant gait images that is side view images with normal clothing and without carrying bags. A unique advantage of this approach is that the view angle and other variations are not needed before generating invariant gait images. The most important computational challenge, however, is to address how to retain useful identity information when generating the invariant gait images. To this end, our approach differs from the traditional GAN which has only one discriminator in that GaitGAN contains two discriminators. One is a fake/real discriminator which can make the generated gait images to be realistic. Another one is an identification discriminator which ensures that the the generated gait images contain human identification information. Experimental results show that GaitGAN can achieve state-of-the-art performance. To the best of our knowledge this is the first gait recognition method based on GAN with encouraging results. Nevertheless, we have identified several research directions to further improve GaitGAN.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w6/html/Yu_GaitGAN_Invariant_Gait_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shiqi Yu, Haifeng Chen, Edel B.

Gated Feedback Refinement Network for Dense Image Labeling	Effective integration of local and global contextual information is crucial for dense labeling problems. Most existing methods based on an encoder-decoder architecture simply concatenate features from earlier layers to obtain higher-frequency details in the refinement stages. However, there are limits to the quality of refinement possible if ambiguous information is passed forward. In this paper we propose Gated Feedback Refinement Network (G-FRNet), an end-to-end deep learning framework for dense labeling tasks that addresses this limitation of existing methods. Initially, G-FRNet makes a coarse prediction and then it progressively refines the details by efficiently integrating local and global contextual information during the refinement stages. We introduce gate units that control the information passed forward in order to filter out ambiguity. Experiments on three challenging dense labeling datasets (CamVid, PASCAL VOC 2012, and Horse-Cow Parsing) show the effectiveness of our method. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the CamVid and Horse-Cow Parsing datasets, and produces competitive results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Islam_Gated_Feedback_Refinement_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Md Amirul Islam, Mrigank Rochan, Neil D.

Gaze Embeddings for Zero-Shot Image Classification	Zero-shot image classification using auxiliary information, such as attributes describing discriminative object properties, requires time-consuming annotation by domain experts. We instead propose a method that relies on human gaze as auxiliary information, exploiting that even non-expert users have a natural ability to judge class membership. We present a data collection paradigm that involves a discrimination task to increase the information content obtained from gaze data. Our method extracts discriminative descriptors from the data and learns a compatibility function between image and gaze using three novel gaze embeddings: Gaze Histograms (GH), Gaze Features with Grid (GFG) and Gaze Features with Sequence (GFS). We introduce two new gaze-annotated datasets for fine-grained image classification and show that human gaze data is indeed class discriminative, provides a competitive alternative to expert-annotated attributes, and outperforms other baselines for zero-shot image classification.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Karessli_Gaze_Embeddings_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Nour Karessli, Zeynep Akata, Bernt Schiele, Andreas Bulling
General Models for Rational Cameras and the Case of Two-Slit Projections	"The rational camera model recently introduced in [18] provides a general methodology for studying abstract nonlinear imaging systems and their multi-view geometry. This paper builds on this framework to study ""physical realizations"" of rational cameras. More precisely, we give an explicit account of the mapping between between physical visual rays and image points (missing in the original description), which allows us to give simple analytical expressions for direct and inverse projections. We also consider ""primitive"" camera models, that are orbits under the action of various projective transformations, and lead to a general notion of intrinsic parameters. The methodology is general, but it is illustrated concretely by an in-depth study of two-slit cameras, that we model using pairs of linear projections. This simple analytical form allows us to describe models for the corresponding primitive cameras, to introduce intrinsic parameters with a clear geometric meaning, and to define an epipolar tensor characterizing two-view correspondences. In turn, this leads to new algorithms for structure from motion and self-calibration."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Trager_General_Models_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Matthew Trager, Bernd Sturmfels, John Canny, Martial Hebert, Jean Ponce
Generalized Deep Image to Image Regression	We present a Deep Convolutional Neural Network architecture which serves as a generic image-to-image regressor that can be trained end-to-end without any further machinery. Our proposed architecture, the Recursively Branched Deconvolutional Network (RBDN), develops a cheap multi-context image representation very early on using an efficient recursive branching scheme with extensive parameter sharing and learnable upsampling. This multi-context representation is subjected to a highly non-linear locality preserving transformation by the remainder of our network comprising of a series of convolutions/deconvolutions without any spatial downsampling. The RBDN architecture is fully convolutional and can handle variable sized images during inference. We provide qualitative/quantitative results on 3 diverse tasks: relighting, denoising and colorization and show that our proposed RBDN architecture obtains comparable results to the state-of-the-art on each of these tasks when used off-the-shelf without any post processing or task-specific architectural modifications.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Santhanam_Generalized_Deep_Image_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Venkataraman Santhanam, Vlad I.

Generalized Rank Pooling for Activity Recognition	Most popular deep models for action recognition split video sequences into short sub-sequences consisting of a few frames; frame-based features are then pooled for recognizing the activity. Usually, this pooling step discards the temporal order of the frames, which could otherwise be used for better recognition. Towards this end, we propose a novel pooling method, generalized rank pooling (GRP), that takes as input, features from the intermediate layers of a CNN that is trained on tiny sub-sequences, and produces as output the parameters of a subspace which (i) provides a low-rank approximation to the features and (ii) preserves their temporal order. We propose to use these parameters as a compact representation for the video sequence, which is then used in a classification setup. We formulate an objective for computing this subspace as a Riemannian optimization problem on the Grassmann manifold, and propose an efficient conjugate gradient scheme for solving it. Experiments on several activity recognition datasets show that our scheme leads to state-of-the-art performance.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Cherian_Generalized_Rank_Pooling_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Anoop Cherian, Basura Fernando, Mehrtash Harandi, Stephen Gould
Generalized Semantic Preserving Hashing for N-Label Cross-Modal Retrieval	Due to availability of large amounts of multimedia data, cross-modal matching is gaining increasing importance. Hashing based techniques provide an attractive solution to this problem when the data size is large. Different scenarios of cross-modal matching are possible, for example, data from the different modalities can be associated with a single label or multiple labels, and in addition may or may not have one-to-one correspondence. Most of the existing approaches have been developed for the case where there is one-to-one correspondence between the data of the two modalities. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet effective generalized hashing framework which can work for all the different scenarios, while preserving the semantic distance between the data points. The approach first learns the optimum hash codes for the two modalities simultaneously, so as to preserve the semantic similarity between the data points, and then learns the hash functions to map from the features to the hash codes. Extensive experiments on single label dataset like Wiki and multi-label datasets like NUS-WIDE, Pascal and LabelMe under all the different scenarios and comparisons with the state-of-the-art shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Mandal_Generalized_Semantic_Preserving_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Devraj Mandal, Kunal N.

Generating 5D Light Fields in Scattering Media for Representing 3D Images	In this paper, we propose a novel method for displaying 3D images based on a 5D light field representation. In our method, the light fields emitted by a light field projector are projected into 3D scattering media such as fog. The intensity of light lays projected into the scattering media decreases because of the scattering effect of the media. As a result, 5D light fields are generated in the scattering media. The proposed method models the relationship between the 5D light fields and observed images, and uses the relationship for projecting light fields so that the observed image changes according to the viewpoint of observers. In order to achieve accurate and efficient 3D image representation, we describe the relationship not by using a parametric model, but by using an observation based model obtained from a point spread function (PSF) of scattering media. The experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w15/html/Yuasa_Generating_5D_Light_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Eri Yuasa, Fumihiko Sakaue, Jun Sato
Generating Descriptions With Grounded and Co-Referenced People	Learning how to generate descriptions of images or videos received major interest both in the Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing communities. While a few works have proposed to learn a grounding during the generation process in an unsupervised way (via an attention mechanism), it remains unclear how good the quality of the grounding is and whether it benefits the description quality. In this work we propose a movie description model which learns to generate description and jointly ground (localize) the mentioned characters as well as do visual co-reference resolution between pairs of consecutive sentences/clips. We also propose to use weak localization supervision through character mentions provided in movie descriptions to learn the character grounding. At training time, we first learn how to localize characters by relating their visual appearance to mentions in the descriptions via a semi-supervised approach. We then provide this (noisy) supervision into our description model which greatly improves its performance. Our proposed description model improves over prior work w.r.t. generated description quality and additionally provides grounding and local co-reference resolution. We evaluate it on the MPII Movie Description dataset using automatic and human evaluation measures and using our newly collected grounding and co-reference data for characters.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Rohrbach_Generating_Descriptions_With_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Anna Rohrbach, Marcus Rohrbach, Siyu Tang, Seong Joon Oh, Bernt Schiele
Generating Holistic 3D Scene Abstractions for Text-Based Image Retrieval	Spatial relationships between objects provide important information for text-based image retrieval. As users are more likely to describe a scene from a real world perspective, using 3D spatial relationships rather than 2D relationships that assume a particular viewing direction, one of the main challenges is to infer the 3D structure that bridges images with users' text descriptions. However, direct inference of 3D structure from images requires learning from large scale annotated data. Since interactions between objects can be reduced to a limited set of atomic spatial relations in 3D, we study the possibility of inferring 3D structure from a text description rather than an image, applying physical relation models to synthesize holistic 3D abstract object layouts satisfying the spatial constraints present in a textual description. We present a generic framework for retrieving images from a textual description of a scene by matching images with these generated abstract object layouts. Images are ranked by matching object detection outputs (bounding boxes) to 2D layout candidates (also represented by bounding boxes) which are obtained by projecting the 3D scenes with sampled camera directions. We validate our approach using public indoor scene datasets and show that our method outperforms baselines built upon object occurrence histograms and learned 2D pairwise relations.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Li_Generating_Holistic_3D_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ang Li, Jin Sun, Joe Yue-Hei Ng, Ruichi Yu, Vlad I.

Generating the Future With Adversarial Transformers	We learn models to generate the immediate future in video. This problem has two main challenges. Firstly, since the future is uncertain, models should be multi-modal, which can be difficult to learn. Secondly, since the future is similar to the past, models store low-level details, which complicates learning of high-level semantics. We propose a framework to tackle both of these challenges. We present a model that generates the future by transforming pixels in the past. Our approach explicitly disentangles the model's memory from the prediction, which helps the model learn desirable invariances. Experiments suggest that this model can generate short videos of plausible futures. We believe predictive models have many applications in robotics, health-care, and video understanding.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Vondrick_Generating_the_Future_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Carl Vondrick, Antonio Torralba
Generative Adversarial Learning for Reducing Manual Annotation in Semantic Segmentation on Large Scale Miscroscopy Images: Automated Vessel Segmentation in Retinal Fundus Image as Test Case	Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) based semantic segmentation require extensive pixel level manual annotation which is daunting for large microscopic images. The paper is aimed towards mitigating this labeling effort by leveraging the recent concept of generative adversarial network(GAN) wherein a generator maps latent noise space to realistic images while a discriminator differentiates between samples drawn from database and generator. We extend this concept to a multi task learning wherein a discriminator-classifier network differentiates between fake/real examples and also assigns correct class labels. Though our concept is generic, we applied it for the challenging task of vessel segmentation in fundus images. We show that proposed method is more data efficient than a CNN. Specifically, with 150K, 30K and 15K training examples, proposed method achieves mean AUC of 0.962, 0.945 and 0.931 respectively, whereas the simple CNN achieves AUC of 0.960, 0.921 and 0.916 respectively.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w8/html/Lahiri_Generative_Adversarial_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Avisek Lahiri, Kumar Ayush, Prabir Kumar Biswas, Pabitra Mitra
Generative Attribute Controller With Conditional Filtered Generative Adversarial Networks	We present a generative attribute controller (GAC), a novel functionality for generating or editing an image while intuitively controlling large variations of an attribute. This controller is based on a novel generative model called the conditional filtered generative adversarial network (CFGAN), which is an extension of the conventional conditional GAN (CGAN) that incorporates a filtering architecture into the generator input. Unlike the conventional CGAN, which represents an attribute directly using an observable variable (e.g., the binary indicator of attribute presence) so its controllability is restricted to attribute labeling (e.g., restricted to an ON or OFF control), the CFGAN has a filtering architecture that associates an attribute with a multi-dimensional latent variable, enabling latent variations of the attribute to be represented. We also define the filtering architecture and training scheme considering controllability, enabling the variations of the attribute to be intuitively controlled using typical controllers (radio buttons and slide bars). We evaluated our CFGAN on MNIST, CUB, and CelebA datasets and show that it enables large variations of an attribute to be not only represented but also intuitively controlled while retaining identity. We also show that the learned latent space has enough expressive power to conduct attribute transfer and attribute-based image retrieval.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kaneko_Generative_Attribute_Controller_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Takuhiro Kaneko, Kaoru Hiramatsu, Kunio Kashino
Generative Face Completion	In this paper, we propose an effective face completion algorithm using a deep generative model. Different from well-studied background completion, the face completion task is more challenging as it often requires to generate semantically new pixels for the missing key components (e.g., eyes and mouths) that contain large appearance variations. Unlike existing nonparametric algorithms that search for patches to synthesize, our algorithm directly generates contents for missing regions based on a neural network. The model is trained with a combination of a reconstruction loss, two adversarial losses and a semantic parsing loss, which ensures pixel faithfulness and local-global contents consistency. With extensive experimental results, we demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that our model is able to deal with a large area of missing pixels in arbitrary shapes and generate realistic face completion results.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Li_Generative_Face_Completion_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yijun Li, Sifei Liu, Jimei Yang, Ming-Hsuan Yang
Generative Hierarchical Learning of Sparse FRAME Models	This paper proposes a method for generative learning of hierarchical random field models. The resulting model, which we call the hierarchical sparse FRAME (Filters, Random field, And Maximum Entropy) model, is a generalization of the original sparse FRAME model by decomposing it into multiple parts that are allowed to shift their locations, scales and rotations, so that the resulting model becomes a hierarchical deformable template. The model can be trained by an EM-type algorithm that alternates the following two steps: (1) Inference: Given the current model, we match it to each training image by inferring the unknown locations, scales, and rotations of the object and its parts by recursive sum-max maps, and (2) Re-learning: Given the inferred geometric configurations of the objects and their parts, we re-learn the model parameters by maximum likelihood estimation via stochastic gradient algorithm. Experiments show that the proposed method is capable of learning meaningful and interpretable templates that can be used for object detection, classification and clustering.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xie_Generative_Hierarchical_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jianwen Xie, Yifei Xu, Erik Nijkamp, Ying Nian Wu, Song-Chun Zhu
Geodesic Distance Descriptors	The Gromov-Hausdorff (GH) distance is traditionally used for measuring distances between metric spaces. It was adapted for non-rigid shape comparison and matching of isometric surfaces, and is defined as the minimal distortion of embedding one surface into the other, while the optimal correspondence can be described as the map that minimizes this distortion. Solving such a minimization is a hard combinatorial problem that requires precomputation and storing of all pairwise geodesic distances for the matched surfaces. A popular way for compact representation of functions on surfaces is by projecting them into the leading eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LBO). When truncated, the basis of the LBO is known to be the optimal for representing functions with bounded gradient in a min-max sense. Methods such as Spectral-GMDS exploit this idea to simplify and efficiently approximate a minimization related to the GH distance by operating in the truncated spectral domain, and obtain state of the art results for matching of nearly isometric shapes. However, when considering only a specific set of functions on the surface, such as geodesic distances, an optimized basis could be considered as an even better alternative. Moreover, current simplifications of approximating the GH distance introduce errors due to low rank approximations and relaxations of the permutation matrices. Here, we define the geodesic distance basis, which is optimal for compact approximation of geodesic distances, in terms of Frobenius norm. We use the suggested basis to extract the Geodesic Distance Descriptor (GDD), which encodes the geodesic distances information as a linear combination of the basis functions. We then show how these ideas can be used to efficiently and accurately approximate the metric spaces matching problem with almost no loss of information. We incorporate recent methods for efficient approximation of the proposed basis and descriptor without actually computing and storing all geodesic distances. These observations are used to construct a very simple and efficient procedure for shape correspondence. Experimental results show that the GDD improves both accuracy and efficiency of state of the art shape matching procedures.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Shamai_Geodesic_Distance_Descriptors_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Gil Shamai, Ron Kimmel
Geometric Deep Learning on Graphs and Manifolds Using Mixture Model CNNs	Deep learning has achieved a remarkable performance breakthrough in several fields, most notably in speech recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision. In particular, convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures currently produce state-of-the-art performance on a variety of image analysis tasks such as object detection and recognition. Most of deep learning research has so far focused on dealing with 1D, 2D, or 3D Euclidean-structured data such as acoustic signals, images, or videos. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in geometric deep learning, attempting to generalize deep learning methods to non-Euclidean structured data such as graphs and manifolds, with a variety of applications from the domains of network analysis, computational social science, or computer graphics. In this paper, we propose a unified framework allowing to generalize CNN architectures to non-Euclidean domains (graphs and manifolds) and learn local, stationary, and compositional task-specific features. We show that various non-Euclidean CNN methods previously proposed in the literature can be considered as particular instances of our framework. We test the proposed method on standard tasks from the realms of image-, graph- and 3D shape analysis and show that it consistently outperforms previous approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Monti_Geometric_Deep_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Federico Monti, Davide Boscaini, Jonathan Masci, Emanuele Rodola, Jan Svoboda, Michael M.

Geometric Loss Functions for Camera Pose Regression With Deep Learning	Deep learning has shown to be effective for robust and real-time monocular image relocalisation. In particular, PoseNet is a deep convolutional neural network which learns to regress the 6-DOF camera pose from a single image. It learns to localize using high level features and is robust to difficult lighting, motion blur and unknown camera intrinsics, where point based SIFT registration fails. However, it was trained using a naive loss function, with hyper-parameters which require expensive tuning. In this paper, we give the problem a more fundamental theoretical treatment. We explore a number of novel loss functions for learning camera pose which are based on geometry and scene reprojection error. Additionally we show how to automatically learn an optimal weighting to simultaneously regress position and orientation. By leveraging geometry, we demonstrate that our technique significantly improves PoseNet's performance across datasets ranging from indoor rooms to a small city.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kendall_Geometric_Loss_Functions_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Alex Kendall, Roberto Cipolla
Global Context-Aware Attention LSTM Networks for 3D Action Recognition	Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have shown superior performance in 3D human action recognition due to their power in modeling the dynamics and dependencies in sequential data. Since not all joints are informative for action analysis and the irrelevant joints often bring a lot of noise, we need to pay more attention to the informative ones. However, original LSTM does not have strong attention capability. Hence we propose a new class of LSTM network, Global Context-Aware Attention LSTM (GCA-LSTM), for 3D action recognition, which is able to selectively focus on the informative joints in the action sequence with the assistance of global contextual information. In order to achieve a reliable attention representation for the action sequence, we further propose a recurrent attention mechanism for our GCA-LSTM network, in which the attention performance is improved iteratively. Experiments show that our end-to-end network can reliably focus on the most informative joints in each frame of the skeleton sequence. Moreover, our network yields state-of-the-art performance on three challenging datasets for 3D action recognition.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Liu_Global_Context-Aware_Attention_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jun Liu, Gang Wang, Ping Hu, Ling-Yu Duan, Alex C.

Global Hypothesis Generation for 6D Object Pose Estimation	"This paper addresses the task of estimating the 6D-pose of a known 3D object from a single RGB-D image. Most modern approaches solve this task in three steps: i) compute local features; ii) generate a pool of pose-hypotheses; iii) select and refine a pose from the pool. This work focuses on the second step. While all existing approaches generate the hypotheses pool via local reasoning, e.g. RANSAC or Hough-Voting, we are the first to show that global reasoning is beneficial at this stage. In particular, we formulate a novel fully-connected Conditional Random Field (CRF) that outputs a very small number of pose-hypotheses. Despite the potential functions of the CRF being non-Gaussian, we give a new, efficient two-step optimization procedure, with some guarantees for optimality. We utilize our global hypotheses generation procedure to produce results that exceed state-of-the-art for the challenging ""Occluded Object Dataset""."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Michel_Global_Hypothesis_Generation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Frank Michel, Alexander Kirillov, Eric Brachmann, Alexander Krull, Stefan Gumhold, Bogdan Savchynskyy, Carsten Rother
Global Optimality in Neural Network Training	The past few years have seen a dramatic increase in the performance of recognition systems thanks to the introduction of deep networks for representation learning. However, the mathematical reasons for this success remain elusive. A key issue is that the neural network training problem is nonconvex, hence optimization algorithms may not return a global minima. This paper provides sufficient conditions to guarantee that local minima are globally optimal and that a local descent strategy can reach a global minima from any initialization. Our conditions require both the network output and the regularization to be positively homogeneous functions of the network parameters, with the regularization being designed to control the network size. Our results apply to networks with one hidden layer, where size is measured by the number of neurons in the hidden layer, and multiple deep subnetworks connected in parallel, where size is measured by the number of subnetworks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Haeffele_Global_Optimality_in_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Benjamin D.

Graph-Regularized Generalized Low-Rank Models	Image data is frequently extremely large and oftentimes pixel values are occluded or observed with noise. Additionally, images can be related to each other, as in images of a particular individual. This method augments the recently proposed Generalized Low Rank Model (GLRM) framework with graph regularization, which flexibly models relationships between images. For example, relationships might include images that change slowly over time (as in video or surveillance data), images of the same individual, or diagnostic images which picture the same medical condition. This paper proposes a fast optimization method to solve these graph-regularized GLRMs, which we have released as an open-source software library. We demonstrate that the method outperforms competing methods on a variety of data sets, and show how to use this method to classify and group images.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w29/html/Paradkar_Graph-Regularized_Generalized_Low-Rank_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mihir Paradkar, Madeleine Udell
Graph-Structured Representations for Visual Question Answering	"This paper proposes to improve visual question answering (VQA) with structured representations of both scene contents and questions. A key challenge in VQA is to require joint reasoning over the visual and text domains. The predominant CNN/LSTM-based approach to VQA is limited by monolithic vector representations that largely ignore structure in the scene and in the question. CNN feature vectors cannot effectively capture situations as simple as multiple object instances, and LSTMs process questions as series of words, which do not reflect the true complexity of language structure. We instead propose to build graphs over the scene objects and over the question words, and we describe a deep neural network that exploits the structure in these representations. We show that this approach achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art, increasing accuracy from 71.2% to 74.4% in accuracy on the ""abstract scenes"" multiple-choice benchmark, and from 34.7% to 39.1% in accuracy over pairs of ""balanced"" scenes, i.e. images with fine-grained differences and opposite yes/no answers to a same question."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Teney_Graph-Structured_Representations_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Damien Teney, Lingqiao Liu, Anton van den Hengel
Grassmannian Manifold Optimization Assisted Sparse Spectral Clustering	Spectral Clustering is one of pioneered clustering methods in machine learning and pattern recognition field. It relies on the spectral decomposition criterion to learn a low-dimensonal embedding of data for a basic clustering algorithm such as the k-means. The recent sparse Spectral clustering (SSC) introduces the sparsity for the similarity in low-dimensional space by enforcing a sparsity-induced penalty, resulting a non-convex optimization, and the solution is calculated through a relaxed convex problem via the standard ADMM (Alternative Direction Method of Multipliers), rather than inferring latent representation from eigen-structure. This paper provides a direct solution as solving a new Grassmann optimization problem. By this way calculating latent embedding becomes part of optmization on manifolds and the recently developed manifold optimization methods can be applied. It turns out the learned new features are not only very informative for clustering, but also more intuitive and effective in visualization after dimensionality reduction. We conduct empirical studies on simulated datasets and several real-world benchmark datasets to validate the proposed methods. Experimental results exhibit the effectiveness of this new manifold-based clustering and dimensionality reduction method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_Grassmannian_Manifold_Optimization_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Qiong Wang, Junbin Gao, Hong Li
Ground Truth Accuracy and Performance of the Matching Pipeline	Feature matching quality strongly influences the accuracy of most computer vision tasks. This led to impressive advances in keypoint detection, descriptor calculation, and feature matching itself. To compare different approaches and evaluate their quality, datasets from related tasks are used. Unfortunately, none of these datasets actually provide ground truth (GT) feature matches. Thus, matches can only be approximated due to repeatability errors of keypoint detectors and inaccuracies of GT. In this paper, we introduce ground truth matches (GTM) for several well known datasets. Based on the provided spacial ground truth, we automatically generate them using popular feature types. Currently, feature matching evaluation is typically performed using precision and recall. The introduced GTM additionally enable evaluation with accuracy and fall-out. The datasets were manually annotated, on the one hand to evaluate the precision and unambiguousness of the GTM, and on the other hand to determine the accuracy of the ground truth provided with the datasets. Using GTM, we present an evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art keypoint-descriptor combinations as well as matching algorithms.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w10/html/Maier_Ground_Truth_Accuracy_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Josef Maier, Martin Humenberger, Oliver Zendel, Markus Vincze
Group-Wise Point-Set Registration Based on Renyi's Second Order Entropy	In this paper, we describe a set of robust algorithms for group-wise registration using both rigid and non-rigid transformations of multiple unlabelled point-sets with no bias toward a given set. These methods mitigate the need to establish a correspondence among the point-sets by representing them as probability density functions where the registration is treated as a multiple distribution alignment. Holder's and Jensen's inequalities provide a notion of similarity/distance among point-sets and Renyi's second order entropy yields a closed-form solution to the cost function and update equations. We also show that the methods can be improved by normalizing the entropy with a scale factor. These provide simple, fast and accurate algorithms to compute the spatial transformation function needed to register multiple point-sets. The algorithms are compared against two well-known methods for group-wise point-set registration. The results show an improvement in both accuracy and computational complexity.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Giraldo_Group-Wise_Point-Set_Registration_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Luis G.

Growing a Brain: Fine-Tuning by Increasing Model Capacity	CNNs have made an undeniable impact on computer vision through the ability to learn high-capacity models with large annotated training sets. One of their remarkable properties is the ability to transfer knowledge from a large source dataset to a (typically smaller) target dataset. This is usually accomplished through fine-tuning a fixed-size network on new target data. Indeed, virtually every contemporary visual recognition system makes use of fine-tuning to transfer knowledge from ImageNet. In this work, we analyze what components and parameters change during fine-tuning, and discover that increasing model capacity allows for more natural model adaptation through fine-tuning. By making an analogy to developmental learning, we demonstrate that growing a CNN with additional units, either by widening existing layers or deepening the overall network, significantly outperforms classic fine-tuning approaches. But in order to properly grow a network, we show that newly-added units must be appropriately normalized to allow for a pace of learning that is consistent with existing units. We empirically validate our approach on several benchmark datasets, producing state-of-the-art results.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_Growing_a_Brain_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yu-Xiong Wang, Deva Ramanan, Martial Hebert
GuessWhat?! Visual Object Discovery Through Multi-Modal Dialogue	We introduce GuessWhat?!, a two-player guessing game as a testbed for research on the interplay of computer vision and dialogue systems. The goal of the game is to locate an unknown object in a rich image scene by asking a sequence of questions. Higher-level image understanding, like spatial reasoning and language grounding, is required to solve the proposed task. Our key contribution is the collection of a large-scale dataset consisting of 150K human-played games with a total of 800K visual question-answer pairs on 66K images. We explain our design decisions in collecting the dataset and introduce the oracle and questioner tasks that are associated with the two players of the game. We prototyped deep learning models to establish initial baselines of the introduced tasks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/de_Vries_GuessWhat_Visual_Object_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Harm de Vries, Florian Strub, Sarath Chandar, Olivier Pietquin, Hugo Larochelle, Aaron Courville
HOPE: Hierarchical Object Prototype Encoding for Efficient Object Instance Search in Videos	This paper tackles the problem of efficient and effective object instance search in videos. To effectively capture the relevance between a query and video frames and precisely localize the particular object, we leverage the object proposals to improve the quality of object instance search in videos. However, hundreds of object proposals obtained from each frame could result in unaffordable memory and computational cost. To this end, we present a simple yet effective hierarchical object prototype encoding (HOPE) model to accelerate the object instance search without sacrificing accuracy, which exploits both the spatial and temporal self-similarity property existing in object proposals generated from video frames. We design two types of sphere k-means methods, i.e., spatially-constrained sphere k-means and temporally-constrained sphere k-means to learn frame-level object prototypes and dataset-level object prototypes, respectively. In this way, the object instance search problem is cast to the sparse matrix-vector multiplication problem. Thanks to the sparsity of the codes, both the memory and computational cost are significantly reduced. Experimental results on two video datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the performance of video object instance search over other state-of-the-art fast search schemes.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yu_HOPE_Hierarchical_Object_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tan Yu, Yuwei Wu, Junsong Yuan
HPatches: A Benchmark and Evaluation of Handcrafted and Learned Local Descriptors	In this paper, we propose a novel benchmark for evaluating local image descriptors. We demonstrate that the existing datasets and evaluation protocols do not specify unambiguously all aspects of evaluation, leading to ambiguities and inconsistencies in results reported in the literature. Furthermore, these datasets are nearly saturated due to the recent improvements in local descriptors obtained by learning them from large annotated datasets. Therefore, we introduce a new large dataset suitable for training and testing modern descriptors, together with strictly defined evaluation protocols in several tasks such as matching, retrieval and classification. This allows for more realistic, and thus more reliable comparisons in different application scenarios. We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art descriptors and analyse their properties. We show that a simple normalisation of traditional hand-crafted descriptors can boost their performance to the level of deep learning based descriptors within a realistic benchmarks evaluation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Balntas_HPatches_A_Benchmark_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Vassileios Balntas, Karel Lenc, Andrea Vedaldi, Krystian Mikolajczyk
HSfM: Hybrid Structure-from-Motion	Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods can be broadly categorized as incremental or global according to their ways to estimate initial camera poses. While incremental system has advanced in robustness and accuracy, the efficiency remains its key challenge. To solve this problem, global reconstruction system simultaneously estimates all camera poses from the epipolar geometry graph, but it is usually sensitive to outliers. In this work, we propose a new hybrid SfM method to tackle the issues of efficiency, accuracy and robustness in a unified framework. More specifically, we propose an adaptive community-based rotation averaging method first to estimate camera rotations in a global manner. Then, based on these estimated camera rotations, camera centers are computed in an incremental way. Extensive experiments show that our hybrid method performs similarly or better than many of the state-of-the-art global SfM approaches, in terms of computational efficiency, while achieves similar reconstruction accuracy and robustness with two other state-of-the-art incremental SfM approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Cui_HSfM_Hybrid_Structure-from-Motion_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hainan Cui, Xiang Gao, Shuhan Shen, Zhanyi Hu
Hallucinating Very Low-Resolution Unaligned and Noisy Face Images by Transformative Discriminative Autoencoders	Most of the conventional face hallucination methods assume the input image is sufficiently large and aligned, and all require the input image to be noise-free. Their performance degrades drastically if the input image is tiny, unaligned, and contaminated by noise. In this paper, we introduce a novel transformative discriminative autoencoder to 8X super-resolve unaligned noisy and tiny (16X16) low-resolution face images. In contrast to encoder-decoder based autoencoders, our method uses decoder-encoder-decoder networks. We first employ a transformative discriminative decoder network to upsample and denoise simultaneously. Then we use a transformative encoder network to project the intermediate HR faces to aligned and noise-free LR faces. Finally, we use the second decoder to generate hallucinated HR images. Our extensive evaluations on a very large face dataset show that our method achieves superior hallucination results and outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin of 1.82dB PSNR.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yu_Hallucinating_Very_Low-Resolution_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xin Yu, Fatih Porikli
Hand Gesture Based Region Marking for Tele-Support Using Wearables	Wearable Augmented Reality devices are being explored in many applications for visualizing real-time contextual information. More importantly, these devices can also be used in tele-assistance from remote sites when on-field operators require off-field expert's guidance for trouble-shooting. For an effective communication, touchless hand gestures are the most intuitive to select a Region Of Interest (ROI) like defective parts in a machine, through a wearable. This paper presents a hand gestural interaction method to localise the ROI in FPV. Novelty of the proposed method include (a)touchless finger based gesture recognition algorithm that runs on smartphones, which can be used with wearable frugal modality like Google Cardboard/Wearality, (b)reducing the network latency and achieving real-time performance by on-board implementation of recognition module. We also conducted user studies that suggest the usefulness of the proposed method and evaluated it using the PASCAL VOC criteria.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w4/html/Gupta_Hand_Gesture_Based_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Archie Gupta, Shreyash Mohatta, Jitender Maurya, Ramakrishna Perla, Ramya Hebbalaguppe, Ehtesham Hassan
Hand Keypoint Detection in Single Images Using Multiview Bootstrapping	We present an approach that uses a multi-camera system to train fine-grained detectors for keypoints that are prone to occlusion, such as the joints of a hand. We call this procedure multiview bootstrapping: first, an initial keypoint detector is used to produce noisy labels in multiple views of the hand. The noisy detections are then triangulated in 3D using multiview geometry or marked as outliers. Finally, the reprojected triangulations are used as new labeled training data to improve the detector. We repeat this process, generating more labeled data in each iteration. We derive a result analytically relating the minimum number of views to achieve target true and false positive rates for a given detector. The method is used to train a hand keypoint detector for single images. The resulting keypoint detector runs in realtime on RGB images and has accuracy comparable to methods that use depth sensors. The single view detector, triangulated over multiple views, enables 3D markerless hand motion capture with complex object interactions.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Simon_Hand_Keypoint_Detection_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tomas Simon, Hanbyul Joo, Iain Matthews, Yaser Sheikh
Hand Movement Prediction Based Collision-Free Human-Robot Interaction	We present a framework from vision based hand movement prediction in a real-world human-robot collaborative scenario for safety guarantee. We first propose a perception submodule that takes in visual data solely and predicts human collaborator's hand movement. Then a robot trajectory adaptive planning submodule is developed that takes the noisy movement prediction signal into consideration for optimization. We first collect a new human manipulation dataset that can supplement the previous publicly available dataset with motion capture data to serve as the ground truth of hand location. We then integrate the algorithm with a robot manipulator that can collaborate with human workers on a set of trained manipulation actions, and it is shown that such a robot system outperforms the one without movement prediction in terms of collision avoidance.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w5/html/Wang_Hand_Movement_Prediction_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yiwei Wang, Xin Ye, Yezhou Yang, Wenlong Zhang
Hand-Object Interaction Detection With Fully Convolutional Networks	Detecting hand-object interactions is a challenging problem with many applications in the human-computer interaction domain. We present a real-time method that automatically detects hand-object interactions in RGBD sensor data and tracks the object's rigid pose over time. The detection is performed using a fully convolutional neural network, which is purposefully trained to discern the relationship between hands and objects and which predicts pixel-wise class probabilities. This output is used in a probabilistic pixel labeling strategy that explicitly accounts for the uncertainty of the prediction. Based on the labeling of object pixels, the object is tracked over time using model-based registration. We evaluate the accuracy and generalizability of our approach and make our annotated RGBD dataset as well as our trained models publicly available.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w14/html/Schroder_Hand-Object_Interaction_Detection_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Matthias Schroder, Helge Ritter
Hard Mixtures of Experts for Large Scale Weakly Supervised Vision	Training convolutional networks (CNN's) that fit on a single GPU with minibatch stochastic gradient descent has become effective in practice. However, there is still no effective method for training large networks that do not fit in the memory of a few GPU cards, or for parallelizing CNN training. In this work we show that a simple hard mixture of experts model can be efficiently trained to good effect on large scale hashtag (multilabel) prediction tasks. Mixture of experts models are not new [??], but in the past, researchers have had to devise sophisticated methods to deal with data fragmentation. We show empirically that modern weakly supervised data sets are large enough to support naive partitioning schemes where each data point is assigned to a single expert. Because the experts are independent, training them in parallel is easy, and evaluation is cheap for the size of the model. Furthermore, we show that we can use a single decoding layer for all the experts, allowing a unified feature embedding space. We demonstrate that it is feasible (and in fact relatively painless) to train far larger models than could be practically trained with standard CNN architectures, and that the extra capacity can be well used on current datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Gross_Hard_Mixtures_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Sam Gross, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Arthur Szlam
Hardware-Efficient Guided Image Filtering for Multi-Label Problem	The Guided Filter (GF) is well-known for its linear complexity. However, when filtering an image with an n-channel guidance, GF needs to invert an n xn matrix for each pixel. To the best of our knowledge existing matrix inverse algorithms are inefficient on current hardwares. This shortcoming limits applications of multichannel guidance in computation intensive system such as multi-label system. We need a new GF-like filter that can perform fast multichannel image guided filtering. Since the optimal linear complexity of GF cannot be minimized further, the only way thus is to bring all potentialities of current parallel computing hardwares into full play. In this paper we propose a hardware-efficient Guided Filter (HGF), which solves the efficiency problem of multichannel guided image filtering and yields competent results when applying it to multi-label problems with synthesized polynomial multichannel guidance. Specifically, in order to boost the filtering performance, HGF takes a new matrix inverse algorithm which only involves two hardware-efficient operations: element-wise arithmetic calculations and box filtering. In order to break the linear model restriction, HGF synthesizes a polynomial multichannel guidance to introduce nonlinearity. Benefiting from our polynomial guidance and hardware-efficient matrix inverse algorithm, HGF not only is more sensitive to the underlying structure of guidance but also achieves the fastest computing speed. Due to these merits, HGF obtains state-of-the-art results in terms of accuracy and efficiency in the computation intensive multi-label systems.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Dai_Hardware-Efficient_Guided_Image_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Longquan Dai, Mengke Yuan, Zechao Li, Xiaopeng Zhang, Jinhui Tang
Harmonic Networks: Deep Translation and Rotation Equivariance	Translating or rotating an input image should not affect the results of many computer vision tasks. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are already translation equivariant: input image translations produce proportionate feature map translations. This is not the case for rotations. Global rotation equivariance is typically sought through data augmentation, but patch-wise equivariance is more difficult. We present Harmonic Networks or H-Nets, a CNN exhibiting equivariance to patch-wise translation and 360-rotation. We achieve this by replacing regular CNN filters with circular harmonics, returning a maximal response and orientation for every receptive field patch. H-Nets use a rich, parameter-efficient and fixed computational complexity representation, and we show that deep feature maps within the network encode complicated rotational invariants. We demonstrate that our layers are general enough to be used in conjunction with the latest architectures and techniques, such as deep supervision and batch normalization. We also achieve state-of-the-art classification on rotated-MNIST, and competitive results on other benchmark challenges.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Worrall_Harmonic_Networks_Deep_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Daniel E.

Harvesting Multiple Views for Marker-Less 3D Human Pose Annotations	"Recent advances with Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) have shifted the bottleneck for many computer vision tasks to annotated data collection. In this paper, we present a geometry-driven approach to automatically collect annotations for human pose prediction tasks. Starting from a generic ConvNet for 2D human pose, and assuming a multi-view setup, we describe an automatic way to collect accurate 3D human pose annotations. We capitalize on constraints offered by the 3D geometry of the camera setup and the 3D structure of the human body to probabilistically combine per view 2D ConvNet predictions into a globally optimal 3D pose. This 3D pose is used as the basis for harvesting annotations. The benefit of the annotations produced automatically with our approach is demonstrated in two challenging settings: (i) fine-tuning a generic ConvNet-based 2D pose predictor to capture the discriminative aspects of a subject's appearance (i.e.,""personalization""), and (ii) training a ConvNet from scratch for single view 3D human pose prediction without leveraging 3D pose groundtruth. The proposed multi-view pose estimator achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in exploiting the available multi-view information."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Pavlakos_Harvesting_Multiple_Views_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Georgios Pavlakos, Xiaowei Zhou, Konstantinos G.

Hidden Layers in Perceptual Learning	Studies in visual perceptual learning investigate the way human performance improves with practice, in the context of relatively simple (and therefore more manageable) visual tasks. Building on the powerful tools currently available for the training of Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), networks whose original architecture was inspired by the visual system, we revisited some of the open computational questions in perceptual learning. We first replicated two representative sets of perceptual learning experiments by training a shallow CNN to perform the relevant tasks. These networks qualitatively showed most of the characteristic behavior observed in perceptual learning, including the hallmark phenomena of specificity and its various manifestations in the forms of transfer or partial transfer, and learning enabling. We next analyzed the dynamics of weight modifications in the networks, identifying patterns which appeared to be instrumental for the transfer (or generalization) of learned skills from one task to another in the simulated networks. These patterns may identify ways by which the domain of search in the parameter space during network re-training can be significantly reduced, thereby accomplishing knowledge transfer.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Cohen_Hidden_Layers_in_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Gad Cohen, Daphna Weinshall
Hierarchical Boundary-Aware Neural Encoder for Video Captioning	The use of Recurrent Neural Networks for video captioning has recently gained a lot of attention, since they can be used both to encode the input video and to generate the corresponding description. In this paper, we present a recurrent video encoding scheme which can discover and leverage the hierarchical structure of the video. Unlike the classical encoder-decoder approach, in which a video is encoded continuously by a recurrent layer, we propose a novel LSTM cell which can identify discontinuity points between frames or segments and modify the temporal connections of the encoding layer accordingly. We evaluate our approach on three large-scale datasets: the Montreal Video Annotation dataset, the MPII Movie Description dataset and the Microsoft Video Description Corpus. Experiments show that our approach can discover appropriate hierarchical representations of input videos and improve the state of the art results on movie description datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Baraldi_Hierarchical_Boundary-Aware_Neural_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Lorenzo Baraldi, Costantino Grana, Rita Cucchiara
Hierarchical Multimodal Metric Learning for Multimodal Classification	Multimodal classification arises in many computer vision tasks such as object classification and image retrieval. The idea is to utilize multiple sources (modalities) measuring the same instance to improve the overall performance compared to using a single source (modality). The varying characteristics exhibited by multiple modalities make it necessary to simultaneously learn the corresponding metrics. In this paper, we propose a multiple metrics learning algorithm for multimodal data. Metric of each modality is a product of two matrices: one matrix is modality specific, the other is enforced to be shared by all the modalities. The learned metrics can improve multimodal classification accuracy and experimental results on four datasets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing learning algorithms based on multiple metrics as well as other approaches tested on these datasets. Specifically, we report 95.0% object instance recognition accuracy, 89.2% object category recognition accuracy on the multi-view RGB-D dataset and 52.3% scene category recognition accuracy on SUN RGB-D dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Hierarchical_Multimodal_Metric_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Heng Zhang, Vishal M.

High-Magnification Multi-Views Based Classification of Breast Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology Cell Samples Using Fusion of Decisions From Deep Convolutional Networks	Fine needle aspiration cytology is commonly used for diagnosis of breast cancer, with traditional practice being based on the subjective visual assessment of the breast cytopathology cell samples under a microscope to evaluate the state of various cytological features. Therefore, there are many challenges in maintaining consistency and reproducibility of findings. However, digital imaging and computational aid in diagnosis can improve the diagnostic accuracy and reduce the effective workload of pathologists. This paper presents a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based classification approach for the diagnosis of the cell samples using their microscopic high-magnification multi-views. The proposed approach has been tested using GoogLeNet architecture of CNN on an image dataset of 37 breast cytopathology samples (24 benign and 13 malignant), where the network was trained using images of 54% cell samples and tested on the rest, achieving 89.7% mean accuracy in 8 fold validation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w8/html/Garud_High-Magnification_Multi-Views_Based_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hrushikesh Garud, S.

High-Resolution Image Inpainting Using Multi-Scale Neural Patch Synthesis	Recent advances in deep learning have shown exciting promise in filling large holes in natural images with semantically plausible and context aware details, impacting fundamental image manipulation tasks such as object removal. While these learning-based methods are significantly more effective in capturing high-level features than prior techniques, they can only handle very low-resolution inputs due to memory limitations and difficulty in training. Even for slightly larger images, the inpainted regions would appear blurry and unpleasant boundaries become visible. We propose a multi-scale neural patch synthesis approach based on joint optimization of image content and texture constraints, which not only preserves contextual structures but also produces high-frequency details by matching and adapting patches with the most similar mid-layer feature correlations of a deep classification network. We evaluate our method on the ImageNet and Paris Streetview datasets and achieved state-of-the-art inpainting accuracy. We show our approach produces sharper and more coherent results than prior methods, especially for high-resolution images.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yang_High-Resolution_Image_Inpainting_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chao Yang, Xin Lu, Zhe Lin, Eli Shechtman, Oliver Wang, Hao Li
Hockey Action Recognition via Integrated Stacked Hourglass Network	A convolutional neural network (CNN) has been designed to interpret player actions in ice hockey video. The hourglass network is employed as the base to generate player pose estimation and layers are added to this network to produce action recognition. As such, the unified architecture is referred to as action recognition hourglass network, or ARHN. ARHN has three components. The first component is the latent pose estimator, the second transforms latent features to a common frame of reference, and the third performs action recognition. Since no benchmark dataset for pose estimation or action recognition is available for hockey players, we generate such an annotated dataset. Experimental results show action recognition accuracy of 65% for four types of actions in hockey. When similar poses are merged to three and two classes, the accuracy rate increases to 71% and 78%, proving the efficacy of the methodology for automated action recognition in hockey.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w2/html/Fani_Hockey_Action_Recognition_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mehrnaz Fani, Helmut Neher, David A.

Human Action Recognition Using Tensor Dynamical System Modeling	This paper presents a new framework for human action classification using a tensor dynamical model of human action from 3-dimensional (3D) volume sequences and distance measurement on Grassmann manifold . The tensor dynamical model is an extension of linear dynamical models for multi-dimensional sequence analysis. Each subdimensional linear dynamic models are estimated from tensor sequences using an iterative expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm after projection of tensor sequence to each dimensional axis. The combination of distances on Grassmann manifold of linear dynamic systems in each dimension of the tensor dynamic model provides similarity measurement between two tensor dynamical systems. The proposed approach can be applied to 3D depth or convex hull data as well as 2D video image sequences. Experimental results show good performance in human action recognition from INRIA multiview human action database.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w29/html/Lee_Human_Action_Recognition_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chan-Su Lee
Human Activity Recognition Using Combinatorial Deep Belief Networks	Human activity recognition is a field undergoing a great amount of research. The main reason for that is the number of practical applications that are developed using activity recognition as the base. This paper proposes an approach to human activity recognition using a combination of deep belief networks. One network is used to obtain features from motion and to do this we propose a modified Weber descriptor. Another network is used to obtain features from images and to do this we propose the modification of the standard local binary patterns descriptor to obtain a concatenated histogram of lower dimensions. This helps to encode spatial and temporal information of various actions happening in a frame. This further helps to overcome the dimensionality problem that occurs with LBP. The features extracted are then passed onto a CNN that classifies the activity. Few standard activities are considered such as walking, sprinting, hugging etc.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w19/html/Gowda_Human_Activity_Recognition_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shreyank N.

Human Shape From Silhouettes Using Generative HKS Descriptors and Cross-Modal Neural Networks	In this work, we present a novel method for capturing human body shape from a single scaled silhouette. We combine deep correlated features capturing different 2D views, and embedding spaces based on 3D cues in a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture. We first train a CNN to find a richer body shape representation space from pose invariant 3D human shape descriptors. Then, we learn a mapping from silhouettes to this representation space, with the help of a novel architecture that exploits correlation of multi-view data during training time, to improve prediction at test time. We extensively validate our results on synthetic and real data, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy as compared to the state-of-the-art, and providing a practical system for detailed human body measurements from a single image.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Dibra_Human_Shape_From_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Endri Dibra, Himanshu Jain, Cengiz Oztireli, Remo Ziegler, Markus Gross
Human-Explainable Features for Job Candidate Screening Prediction	Video blogs (vlogs) are a popular media form for people to present themselves. In case a vlogger would be a job candidate, vlog content can be useful for automatically assessing the candidate's traits, as well as potential interviewability. Using a dataset from the CVPR ChaLearn competition, we build a model predicting Big Five personality trait scores and interviewability of vloggers, explicitly targeting explainability of the system output to humans without technical background. We use human-explainable features as input, and a linear model for the system's building blocks. Four multimodal feature representations are constructed to capture facial expression, movement, and linguistic usage. For each, PCA is used for dimensionality reduction and simple linear regression for the predictive model. Our system's accuracy lies in the middle of the quantitative competition chart, while we can trace back the reasoning behind each score and generate a qualitative analysis report per video.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w26/html/Wicaksana_Human-Explainable_Features_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Achmadnoer Sukma Wicaksana, Cynthia C.

Hyper-Laplacian Regularized Unidirectional Low-Rank Tensor Recovery for Multispectral Image Denoising	Recent low-rank based matrix/tensor recovery methods have been widely explored in multispectral images (MSI) denoising. These methods, however, ignore the difference of the intrinsic structure correlation along spatial sparsity, spectral correlation and non-local self-similarity mode. In this paper, we go further by giving a detailed analysis about the rank properties both in matrix and tensor cases, and figure out the non-local self-similarity is the key ingredient, while the low-rank assumption of others may not hold. This motivates us to design a simple yet effective unidirectional low-rank tensor recovery model that is capable of truthfully capturing the intrinsic structure correlation with reduced computational burden. However, the low-rank models suffer from the ringing artifacts, due to the aggregation of overlapped patches/cubics. While previous methods resort to spatial information, we offer a new perspective by utilizing the exclusively spectral information in MSIs to address the issue. The analysis-based hyper-Laplacian prior is introduced to model the global spectral structures, so as to indirectly alleviate the ringing artifacts in spatial domain. The advantages of the proposed method over the existing ones are multi-fold: more reasonably structure correlation representability, less processing time, and less artifacts in the overlapped regions. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on several benchmarks, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MSI denoising methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chang_Hyper-Laplacian_Regularized_Unidirectional_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yi Chang, Luxin Yan, Sheng Zhong
Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution via Non-Local Sparse Tensor Factorization	Hyperspectral image(HSI)super-resolution, which fuses a low-resolution (LR) HSI with a high-resolution (HR) multispectral image (MSI), has recently attracted much attention. Most of the current HSI super-resolution approaches are based on matrix factorization, which unfolds the three-dimensional HSI as a matrix before processing. In general, the matrix data representation obtained after the matrix unfolding operation makes it hard to fully exploit the inherent HSI spatial-spectral structures. In this paper, a novel HSI super-resolution method based on non-local sparse tensor factorization (called as the NLSTF) is proposed. The sparse tensor factorization can directly decompose each cube of the HSI as a sparse core tensor and dictionaries of three modes, which reformulates the HSI super-resolution problem as the estimation of sparse core tensor and dictionaries for each cube. To further exploit the non-local spatial self-similarities of the HSI, similar cubes are grouped together, and they are assumed to share the same dictionaries. The dictionaries are learned from the LR-HSI and HR-MSI for each group, and corresponding sparse core tensors are estimated by spare coding on the learned dictionaries for each cube. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed NLSTF approach over several state-of-the-art HSI super-resolution approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Dian_Hyperspectral_Image_Super-Resolution_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Renwei Dian, Leyuan Fang, Shutao Li
I Know That Person: Generative Full Body and Face De-Identification of People in Images	We propose a model for full body and face de-identification of humans in images. Given a segmentation of the human figure, our model generates a synthetic human image with an alternative appearance that looks natural and fits the segmentation outline. The model is usable with various levels of segmentation, from simple human figure blobs to complex garment-level segmentations. The level of detail in the de-identified output depends on the level of detail in the input segmentation. The model de-identifies not only primary biometric identifiers (e.g. the face), but also soft and non-biometric identifiers including clothing, hairstyle, etc. Quantitative and perceptual experiments indicate that our model produces de-identified outputs that thwart human and machine recognition, while preserving data utility and naturalness.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w16/html/Kalafatic_I_Know_That_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Karla Brkic; Ivan Sikiric; Tomislav Hrkac; Zoran Kalafatic
IARPA Janus Benchmark-B Face Dataset	Despite the importance of rigorous testing data for evaluating face recognition algorithms, all major publicly available faces-in-the-wild datasets are constrained by the use of a commodity face detector, which limits, among other conditions, pose, occlusion, expression, and illumination variations. In 2015, the NIST IJB-A dataset, which consists of 500 subjects, was released to mitigate these constraints. However, the relatively low number of impostor and genuine matches per split in the IJB-A protocol limits the evaluation of an algorithm at operationally relevant assessment points. This paper builds upon IJB-A and introduces the IARPA Janus Benchmark-B (NIST IJB-B) dataset, a superset of IJB-A. IJB-B consists of 1,845 subjects with human-labeled ground truth face bounding boxes, eye/nose locations, and covariate metadata such as occlusion, facial hair, and skintone for 21,798 still images and 55,026 frames from 7,011 videos. IJB-B was also designed to have a more uniform geographic distribution of subjects across the globe than that of IJB-A. Test protocols for IJB-B represent operational use cases including access point identification, forensic quality media searches, surveillance video searches, and clustering. Finally, all images and videos in IJB-B are published under a Creative Commons distribution license and, therefore, can be freely distributed among the research community.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w6/html/Whitelam_IARPA_Janus_Benchmark-B_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Cameron Whitelam, Emma Taborsky, Austin Blanton, Brianna Maze, Jocelyn Adams, Tim Miller, Nathan Kalka, Anil K.

IM2CAD	Given a single photo of a room and a large database of furniture CAD models, our goal is to reconstruct a scene that is as similar as possible to the scene depicted in the photograph, and composed of objects drawn from the database. We present a completely automatic system to address this IM2CAD problem that produces high quality results on challenging imagery from interior home design and remodeling websites. Our approach iteratively optimizes the placement and scale of objects in the room to best match scene renderings to the input photo, using image comparison metrics trained via deep convolutional neural nets. By operating jointly on the full scene at once, we account for inter-object occlusions. We also show the applicability of our method in standard scene understanding benchmarks where we obtain significant improvement.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Izadinia_IM2CAD_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hamid Izadinia, Qi Shan, Steven M.

IRINA: Iris Recognition (Even) in Inaccurately Segmented Data	"The effectiveness of current iris recognition systems depends on the accurate segmentation and parameterisation of the iris boundaries, as failures at this point misalign the coefficients of the biometric signatures. This paper describes IRINA, an algorithm for Iris Recognition that is robust against INAccurately segmented samples, which makes it a good candidate to work in poor-quality data. The process is based in the concept of ""corresponding"" patch between pairs of images, that is used to estimate the posterior probabilities that patches regard the same biological region, even in case of segmentation errors and non-linear texture deformations. Such information enables to infer a free-form deformation field (2D registration vectors) between images, whose first and second-order statistics provide effective biometric discriminating power. Extensive experiments were carried out in four datasets (CASIA-IrisV3-Lamp, CASIA-IrisV4-Lamp, CASIA-IrisV4-Thousand and WVU) and show that IRINA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in good quality data, but also handles effectively severe segmentation errors and large differences in pupillary dilation / constriction."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Proenca_IRINA_Iris_Recognition_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hugo Proenca, Joao C.

Identifying First-Person Camera Wearers in Third-Person Videos	We consider scenarios in which we wish to perform joint scene understanding, object tracking, activity recognition, and other tasks in scenarios in which multiple people are wearing body-worn cameras while a third-person static camera also captures the scene. To do this, we need to establish person-level correspondences across first- and third-person videos, which is challenging because the camera wearer is not visible from his/her own egocentric video, preventing the use of direct feature matching. In this paper, we propose a new semi-Siamese Convolutional Neural Network architecture to address this novel challenge. We formulate the problem as learning a joint embedding space for first- and third-person videos that considers both spatial- and motion-domain cues. A new triplet loss function is designed to minimize the distance between correct first- and third-person matches while maximizing the distance between incorrect ones. This end-to-end approach performs significantly better than several baselines, in part by learning the first- and third-person features optimized for matching jointly with the distance measure itself.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Fan_Identifying_First-Person_Camera_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chenyou Fan, Jangwon Lee, Mingze Xu, Krishna Kumar Singh, Yong Jae Lee, David J.

Illuminant-Camera Communication to Observe Moving Objects Under Strong External Light by Spread Spectrum Modulation	Many algorithms of computer vision use light sources to illuminate objects to actively create situation appropriate to extract their characteristics. For example, the shape and reflectance are measured by a projector-camera system, and some human-machine or VR systems use projectors and displays for interaction. As existing active lighting systems usually assume no severe external lights to observe projected lights clearly, it is one of the limitations of active illumination. In this paper, we propose a method of energy-efficient active illumination in an environment with severe external lights. The proposed method extracts the light signals of illuminants by removing external light using spread spectrum modulation. Because an image sequence is needed to observe modulated signals, the proposed method extends signal processing to realize signal detection projected onto moving objects by combining spread spectrum modulation and spatio-temporal filtering. In the experiments, we apply the proposed method to a structured-light system under sunlight, to photometric stereo with external lights, and to insensible image embedding.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Sagawa_Illuminant-Camera_Communication_to_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ryusuke Sagawa, Yutaka Satoh
Image Deblurring via Extreme Channels Prior	Camera motion introduces motion blur, affecting many computer vision tasks. Dark Channel Prior (DCP) helps the blind deblurring on scenes including natural, face, text, and low-illumination images. However, it has limitations and is less likely to support the kernel estimation while bright pixels dominate the input image. We observe that the bright pixels in the clear images are not likely to be bright after the blur process. Based on this observation, we first illustrate this phenomenon mathematically and define it as the Bright Channel Prior (BCP). Then, we propose a technique for deblurring such images which elevates the performance of existing motion deblurring algorithms. The proposed method takes advantage of both Bright and Dark Channel Prior. This joint prior is named as extreme channels prior and is crucial for achieving efficient restorations by leveraging both the bright and dark information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust and performs favorably against the state-of-the-art image deblurring methods on both synthesized and natural images.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yan_Image_Deblurring_via_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yanyang Yan, Wenqi Ren, Yuanfang Guo, Rui Wang, Xiaochun Cao
Image Denoising via CNNs: An Adversarial Approach	Is it possible to recover an image from its noisy version using convolutional neural networks? This is an interesting problem as convolutional layers are generally used as feature detectors for tasks like classification, segmentation and object detection. We present a new CNN architecture for blind image denoising which synergically combines three architecture components, a multi-scale feature extraction layer which helps in reducing the effect of noise on feature maps, an l_p regularizer which helps in selecting only the appropriate feature maps for the task of reconstruction, and finally a three step training approach which leverages adversarial training to give the final performance boost to the model. The proposed model shows competitive denoising performance when compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w12/html/Divakar_Image_Denoising_via_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Nithish Divakar, R.

Image Splicing Detection via Camera Response Function Analysis	Recent advances on image manipulation techniques have made image forgery detection increasingly more challenging. An important component in such tools is to fake motion and/or defocus blurs through boundary splicing and copy-move operators, to emulate wide aperture and slow shutter effects. In this paper, we present a new technique based on the analysis of the camera response functions (CRF) for efficient and robust splicing and copy-move forgery detection and localization. We first analyze how non-linear CRFs affect edges in terms of the intensity-gradient bivariable histograms. We show distinguishable shape differences on real vs. forged blurs near edges after a splicing operation. Based on our analysis, we introduce a deep-learning framework to detect and localize forged edges. In particular, we show the problem can be transformed to a handwriting recognition problem an resolved by using a convolutional neural network. We generate a large dataset of forged images produced by splicing followed by retouching and comprehensive experiments show our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy and robustness.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chen_Image_Splicing_Detection_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Can Chen, Scott McCloskey, Jingyi Yu
Image Super Resolution Based on Fusing Multiple Convolution Neural Networks	In this paper, we focus on constructing an accurate super resolution system based on multiple Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). Each individual CNN is trained separately with different network structure. A Context-wise Network Fusion (CNF) approach is proposed to integrate the outputs of individual networks by additional convolution layers. With fine-tuning the whole fused network, the accuracy is significantly improved compared to the individual networks. We also discuss other network fusion schemes, including Pixel-Wise network Fusion (PWF) and Progressive Network Fusion (PNF). The experimental results show that the CNF outperforms PWF and PNF. Using SRCNN as individual network, the CNF network achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on benchmark image datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w12/html/Ren_Image_Super_Resolution_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Haoyu Ren, Mostafa El-Khamy, Jungwon Lee
Image Super-Resolution via Deep Recursive Residual Network	Recently, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based models have achieved great success in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). Owing to the strength of deep networks, these CNN models learn an effective nonlinear mapping from the low-resolution input image to the high-resolution target image, at the cost of requiring enormous parameters. This paper proposes a very deep CNN model (up to 52 convolutional layers) named Deep Recursive Residual Network (DRRN) that strives for deep yet concise networks. Specifically, residual learning is adopted, both in global and local manners, to mitigate the difficulty of training very deep networks; recursive learning is used to control the model parameters while increasing the depth. Extensive benchmark evaluation shows that DRRN significantly outperforms state of the art in SISR, while utilizing far fewer parameters. Code is available at https://github.com/tyshiwo/DRRN_CVPR17.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tai_Image_Super-Resolution_via_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ying Tai, Jian Yang, Xiaoming Liu
Image-Based Visual Perception and Representation for Collision Avoidance	We present a novel on-board perception system for collision avoidance by micro air vehicles (MAV). An egocentric cylindrical representation is utilized to model the world using forward-looking stereo vision. This efficient representation enables a 360o field of regard, as the vehicle moves around and disparity maps are fused temporally on the cylindrical map. For this purpose, we developed a new Gaussian Mixture Models-based disparity image fusion algorithm, with an extension to handle independently moving objects (IMO). The extension improves scene models in case of moving objects, where standard temporal fusion approaches cannot detect movers and introduce errors in world models due to the common static scene assumption. The on-board implementation of the vision pipeline provides disparity maps on a 360o egocentric cylindrical surface at 10 Hz. The perception output is used in our system by real-time motion planning with collision avoidance on the MAV.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w4/html/Cigla_Image-Based_Visual_Perception_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Cevahir Cigla, Roland Brockers, Larry Matthies
Image-To-Image Translation With Conditional Adversarial Networks	We investigate conditional adversarial networks as a general-purpose solution to image-to-image translation problems. These networks not only learn the mapping from input image to output image, but also learn a loss function to train this mapping. This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach to problems that traditionally would require very different loss formulations. We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. Moreover, since the release of the pix2pix software associated with this paper, hundreds of twitter users have posted their own artistic experiments using our system. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work suggests we can achieve reasonable results without handengineering our loss functions either.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Isola_Image-To-Image_Translation_With_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Phillip Isola, Jun-Yan Zhu, Tinghui Zhou, Alexei A.

Improved Cooperative Stereo Matching for Dynamic Vision Sensors With Ground Truth Evaluation	Event-based vision, as realized by bio-inspired Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), is gaining more and more popularity due to its advantages of high temporal resolution, wide dynamic range and power efficiency at the same time. Potential applications include surveillance, robotics, and autonomous navigation under uncontrolled environment conditions. In this paper, we deal with event-based vision for 3D reconstruction of dynamic scene content by using two stationary DVS in a stereo configuration. We focus on a cooperative stereo approach and suggest an improvement over a previously published algorithm that reduces the measured mean error by over 50 percent. An available ground truth data set for stereo event data is utilized to analyze the algorithm's sensitivity to parameter variation and for comparison with competing techniques.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w4/html/Piatkowska_Improved_Cooperative_Stereo_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ewa Piatkowska, Jurgen Kogler, Nabil Belbachir, Margrit Gelautz
Improved Stereo Matching With Constant Highway Networks and Reflective Confidence Learning	"We present an improved three-step pipeline for the stereo matching problem and introduce multiple novelties at each stage. We propose a new highway network architecture for computing the matching cost at each possible disparity, based on multilevel weighted residual shortcuts, trained with a hybrid loss that supports multilevel comparison of image patches. A novel post-processing step is then introduced, which employs a second deep convolutional neural network for pooling global information from multiple disparities. This network outputs both the image disparity map, which replaces the conventional ""winner takes all"" strategy, and a confidence in the prediction. The confidence score is achieved by training the network with a new technique that we call the reflective loss. Lastly, the learned confidence is employed in order to better detect outliers in the refinement step. The proposed pipeline achieves state of the art accuracy on the largest and most competitive stereo benchmarks, and the learned confidence is shown to outperform all existing alternatives."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Shaked_Improved_Stereo_Matching_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Amit Shaked, Lior Wolf
Improved Texture Networks: Maximizing Quality and Diversity in Feed-Forward Stylization and Texture Synthesis	The recent work of Gatys et al., who characterized the style of an image by the statistics of convolutional neural network filters, ignited a renewed interest in the texture generation and image stylization problems. While their image generation technique uses a slow optimization process, recently several authors have proposed to learn generator neural networks that can produce similar outputs in one quick forward pass. While generator networks are promising, they are still inferior in visual quality and diversity compared to generation-by-optimization. In this work, we advance them in two significant ways. First, we introduce an instance normalization module to replace batch normalization with significant improvements to the quality of image stylization. Second, we improve diversity by introducing a new learning formulation that encourages generators to sample unbiasedly from the Julesz texture ensemble, which is the equivalence class of all images characterized by certain filter responses. Together, these two improvements take feed forward texture synthesis and image stylization much closer to the quality of generation-via-optimization, while retaining the speed advantage.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ulyanov_Improved_Texture_Networks_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Dmitry Ulyanov, Andrea Vedaldi, Victor Lempitsky
Improving Facial Attribute Prediction Using Semantic Segmentation	Attributes are semantically meaningful characteristics whose applicability widely crosses category boundaries. They are particularly important in describing and recognizing concepts where no explicit training example is given, e.g., zero-shot learning. Additionally, since attributes are human describable, they can be used for efficient human-computer interaction. In this paper, we propose to employ semantic segmentation to improve facial attribute prediction. The core idea lies in the fact that many facial attributes describe local properties. In other words, the probability of an attribute to appear in a face image is far from being uniform in the spatial domain. We build our facial attribute prediction model jointly with a deep semantic segmentation network. This harnesses the localization cues learned by the semantic segmentation to guide the attention of the attribute prediction to the regions where different attributes naturally show up. As a result of this approach, in addition to recognition, we are able to localize the attributes, despite merely having access to image level labels (weak supervision) during training. We evaluate our proposed method on CelebA and LFWA datasets and achieve superior results to the prior arts. Furthermore, we show that in the reverse problem, semantic face parsing improves when facial attributes are available. That reaffirms the need to jointly model these two interconnected tasks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kalayeh_Improving_Facial_Attribute_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mahdi M.

Improving Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks With Semantic Information	Interpretability of deep neural networks (DNNs) is essential since it enables users to understand the overall strengths and weaknesses of the models, conveys an understanding of how the models will behave in the future, and how to diagnose and correct potential problems. However, it is challenging to reason about what a DNN actually does due to its opaque or black-box nature. To address this issue, we propose a novel technique to improve the interpretability of DNNs by leveraging the rich semantic information embedded in human descriptions. By concentrating on the video captioning task, we first extract a set of semantically meaningful topics from the human descriptions that cover a wide range of visual concepts, and integrate them into the model with an interpretive loss. We then propose a prediction difference maximization algorithm to interpret the learned features of each neuron. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in video captioning using the interpretable features, which can also be transferred to video action recognition. By clearly understanding the learned features, users can easily revise false predictions via a human-in-the-loop procedure.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Dong_Improving_Interpretability_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yinpeng Dong, Hang Su, Jun Zhu, Bo Zhang
Improving Pairwise Ranking for Multi-Label Image Classification	Learning to rank has recently emerged as an attractive technique to train deep convolutional neural networks for various computer vision tasks. Pairwise ranking, in particular, has been successful in multi-label image classification, achieving state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks. However, most existing approaches use the hinge loss to train their models, which is non-smooth and thus is difficult to optimize especially with deep networks. Furthermore, they employ simple heuristics, such as top-k or thresholding, to determine which labels to include in the output from a ranked list of labels, which limits their use in the real-world setting. In this work, we propose two techniques to improve pairwise ranking based multi-label image classification by solving the aforementioned problems: (1) we propose a novel loss function for pairwise ranking, which is smooth everywhere; and (2) we incorporate a label decision module into the model, estimating the optimal confidence thresholds for each visual concept. We provide theoretical analyses of our loss function from the point of view of the Bayes consistency and risk minimization, and show its benefit over existing pairwise ranking formulations. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two large-scale datasets, NUS-WIDE and MS-COCO, achieving the best reported result in the literature.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Li_Improving_Pairwise_Ranking_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yuncheng Li, Yale Song, Jiebo Luo
Improving RANSAC-Based Segmentation Through CNN Encapsulation	In this work, we present a method for improving a random sample consensus (RANSAC) based image segmentation algorithm by encapsulating it within a convolutional neural network (CNN). The improvements are gained by gradient descent training on the set of pre-RANSAC filtering and thresholding operations using a novel RANSAC-based loss function, which is geared toward optimizing the strength of the correct model relative to the most convincing false model. Thus, it can be said that our loss function trains the network on metrics that directly dictate the success or failure of the final segmentation rather than metrics that are merely correlated to the success or failure. We demonstrate successful application of this method to a RANSAC method for identifying the pupil boundary in images from the CASIA-IrisV3 iris recognition data set, and we expect that this method could be successfully applied to any RANSAC-based segmentation algorithm.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Morley_Improving_RANSAC-Based_Segmentation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Dustin Morley, Hassan Foroosh
Improving Training of Deep Neural Networks via Singular Value Bounding	Deep learning methods achieve great success recently on many computer vision problems. In spite of these practical successes, optimization of deep networks remains an active topic in deep learning research. In this work, we focus on investigation of the network solution properties that can potentially lead to good performance. Our research is inspired by theoretical and empirical results that use orthogonal matrices to initialize networks, but we are interested in investigating how orthogonal weight matrices perform when network training converges. To this end, we propose to constrain the solutions of weight matrices in the orthogonal feasible set during the whole process of network training, and achieve this by a simple yet effective method called Singular Value Bounding (SVB). In SVB, all singular values of each weight matrix are simply bounded in a narrow band around the value of 1. Based on the same motivation, we also propose Bounded Batch Normalization (BBN), which improves Batch Normalization by removing its potential risk of ill-conditioned layer transform. We present both theoretical and empirical results to justify our proposed methods. Experiments on benchmark image classification datasets show the efficacy of our proposed SVB and BBN. In particular, we achieve the state-of-the-art results of 3.06% error rate on CIFAR10 and 16.90% on CIFAR100, using off-the-shelf network architectures (Wide ResNets). Our preliminary results on ImageNet also show the promise in large-scale learning. We release the implementation code of our methods at www.aperture-lab.net/research/svb.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Jia_Improving_Training_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Kui Jia, Dacheng Tao, Shenghua Gao, Xiangmin Xu
Incorporating Copying Mechanism in Image Captioning for Learning Novel Objects	Image captioning often requires a large set of training image-sentence pairs. In practice, however, acquiring sufficient training pairs is always expensive, making the recent captioning models limited in their ability to describe objects outside of training corpora (i.e., novel objects). In this paper, we present Long Short-Term Memory with Copying Mechanism (LSTM-C) --- a new architecture that incorporates copying into the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) plus Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) image captioning framework, for describing novel objects in captions. Specifically, freely available object recognition datasets are leveraged to develop classifiers for novel objects. Our LSTM-C then nicely integrates the standard word-by-word sentence generation by a decoder RNN with copying mechanism which may instead select words from novel objects at proper places in the output sentence. Extensive experiments are conducted on both MSCOCO image captioning and ImageNet datasets, demonstrating the ability of our proposed LSTM-C architecture to describe novel objects. Furthermore, superior results are reported when compared to state-of-the-art deep models.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yao_Incorporating_Copying_Mechanism_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ting Yao, Yingwei Pan, Yehao Li, Tao Mei
Incremental Kernel Null Space Discriminant Analysis for Novelty Detection	Novelty detection, which aims to determine whether a given data belongs to any category of training data or not, is considered to be an important and challenging problem in areas of Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning, etc. Recently, kernel null space method (KNDA) was reported to have state-of-the-art performance in novelty detection. However, KNDA is hard to scale up because of its high computational cost. With the ever-increasing size of data, accelerating the implementing speed of KNDA is desired and critical. Moreover, it becomes incapable when there exist successively injected data. To address these issues, we propose the Incremental Kernel Null Space based Discriminant Analysis (IKNDA) algorithm. The key idea is to extract new information brought by newly-added samples and integrate it with the existing model by an efficient updating scheme. Experiments conducted on two publicly-available datasets demonstrate that the proposed IKNDA yields comparable performance as the batch KNDA yet significantly reduces the computational complexity, and our IKNDA based novelty detection methods markedly outperform approaches using deep neural network (DNN) classifiers. This validates the superiority of our IKNDA against the state of the art in novelty detection for large-scale data.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Liu_Incremental_Kernel_Null_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Juncheng Liu, Zhouhui Lian, Yi Wang, Jianguo Xiao
Indoor Scene Parsing With Instance Segmentation, Semantic Labeling and Support Relationship Inference	Over the years, indoor scene parsing has attracted a growing interest in the computer vision community. Existing methods have typically focused on diverse subtasks of this challenging problem. In particular, while some of them aim at segmenting the image into regions, such as object or surface instances, others aim at inferring the semantic labels of given regions, or their support relationships. These different tasks are typically treated as separate ones. However, they bear strong connections: good regions should respect the semantic labels; support can only be defined for meaningful regions; support relationships strongly depend on semantics. In this paper, we therefore introduce an approach to jointly segment the instances and infer their semantic labels and support relationships from a single input image. By exploiting a hierarchical segmentation, we formulate our problem as that of jointly finding the regions in the hierarchy that correspond to instances and estimating their class labels and pairwise support relationships. We express this via a Markov Random Field, which allows us to further encode links between the different types of variables. Inference in this model can be done exactly via integer linear programming, and we learn its parameters in a structural SVM framework. Our experiments on NYUv2 demonstrate the benefits of reasoning jointly about all these subtasks of indoor scene parsing.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhuo_Indoor_Scene_Parsing_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Wei Zhuo, Mathieu Salzmann, Xuming He, Miaomiao Liu
Inferring Hidden Statuses and Actions in Video by Causal Reasoning	In the physical world, cause and effect are inseparable: ambient conditions trigger humans to perform actions, thereby driving status changes of objects. In video, these actions and statuses may be hidden due to ambiguity, occlusion, or because they are otherwise unobservable, but humans nevertheless perceive them. In this paper, we extend the Causal And-Or Graph (C-AOG) to a sequential model representing actions and their effects on objects over time, and we build a probability model for it. For inference, we apply a Viterbi algorithm, grounded on probabilistic detections from video, to fill in hidden and misdetected actions and statuses. We analyze our method on a new video dataset that showcases causes and effects. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of reasoning with causality over time.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w1/html/Fire_Inferring_Hidden_Statuses_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Amy Fire, Song-Chun Zhu
Infinite Variational Autoencoder for Semi-Supervised Learning	This paper presents an infinite variational autoencoder (VAE) whose capacity adapts to suit the input data. This is achieved using a mixture model where the mixing coefficients are modeled by a Dirichlet process, allowing us to integrate over the coefficients when performing inference. Critically, this then allows us to automatically vary the number of autoencoders in the mixture based on the data. Experiments show the flexibility of our method, particularly for semi-supervised learning, where only a small number of training samples are available.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Abbasnejad_Infinite_Variational_Autoencoder_CVPR_2017_paper.html	M.

Information Hiding in RGB Images Using an Improved Matrix Pattern Approach	"In this paper, a novel steganography algorithm based on an improved ""Matrix Pattern"" (MP) method is presented. In this process, firstly, an RGB image is divided into the non-overlapping square-sized blocks. Next, 95 dynamic-sized unique matrix patterns are automatically generated using the 4th and 5th bit layers of the green layer of each block, which are assigned to 95 English keyboard characters. Then, the blue layer of each block is used for embedding secret messages by adding matrix patterns which are assigned to the characters of the secret message. The results show that this algorithm has a high resistance against steganalysis attacks, including Regular Singular (RS), Sample Pair (SP), and PVD based attacks. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm not only improves capacity by over 27% when compared to the existing method, but also results in a slightly better transparency of the stego-image."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w16/html/Leavens_Information_Hiding_in_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Amirfarhad Nilizadeh; Wojciech Mazurczyk; Cliff Zou; Gary T.

Infrared Image Colorization Based on a Triplet DCGAN Architecture	This paper proposes a novel approach for colorizing near infrared (NIR) images using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture. The proposed approach is based on the usage of a triplet model for learning each color channel independently, in a more homogeneous way. It allows a fast convergence during the training, obtaining a greater similarity between the colored NIR image and the corresponding ground truth. The proposed approach has been evaluated with a large data set of NIR images and compared with a recent approach, which is also based on a GAN architecture where all the color channels are obtained at the same time.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w3/html/Suarez_Infrared_Image_Colorization_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Patricia L.

Infrared Variation Optimized Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Robust Automatic Ground Target Recognition	ATR is a traditionally unsolved problem in military applications because of the wide range of infrared (IR) image variations and limited number of training images. Recently, deep convolutional neural network-based approaches in RGB images (RGB-CNN) showed breakthrough performance in computer vision problems. The direct use of the RGB-CNN to IR ATR problem fails to work because of the IR database problems. This paper presents a novel infrared variation-optimized deep convolutional neural network (IVO-CNN) by considering database management, such as increasing the database by a thermal simulator, controlling the image contrast automatically and suppressing the thermal noise to reduce the effects of infrared image variations in deep convolutional neural network-based automatic ground target recognition. The experimental results on the synthesized infrared images generated by the thermal simulator (OKTAL-SE) validated the feasibility of IVO-CNN for military ATR applications.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w3/html/Kim_Infrared_Variation_Optimized_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Sungho Kim, Woo-Jin Song, So-Hyun Kim
Instance-Aware Image and Sentence Matching With Selective Multimodal LSTM	Effective image and sentence matching depends on how to well measure their global visual-semantic similarity. Based on the observation that such a global similarity arises from a complex aggregation of multiple local similarities between pairwise instances of image (objects) and sentence (words), we propose a selective multimodal Long Short-Term Memory network (sm-LSTM) for instance-aware image and sentence matching. The sm-LSTM includes a multimodal context-modulated attention scheme at each timestep that can selectively attend to a pair of instances of image and sentence, by predicting pairwise instance-aware saliency maps for image and sentence. For selected pairwise instances, their representations are obtained based on the predicted saliency maps, and then compared to measure their local similarity. By similarly measuring multiple local similarities within a few timesteps, the sm-LSTM sequentially aggregates them with hidden states to obtain a final matching score as the desired global similarity. Extensive experiments show that our model can well match image and sentence with complex content, and achieve the state-of-the-art results on two public benchmark datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Huang_Instance-Aware_Image_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yan Huang, Wei Wang, Liang Wang
Instance-Level Salient Object Segmentation	Image saliency detection has recently witnessed rapid progress due to deep convolutional neural networks. However, none of the existing methods is able to identify object instances in the detected salient regions. In this paper, we present a salient instance segmentation method that produces a saliency mask with distinct object instance labels for an input image. Our method consists of three steps, estimating saliency map, detecting salient object contours and identifying salient object instances. For the first two steps, we propose a multiscale saliency refinement network, which generates high-quality salient region masks and salient object contours. Once integrated with multiscale combinatorial grouping and a MAP-based subset optimization framework, our method can generate very promising salient object instance segmentation results. To promote further research and evaluation of salient instance segmentation, we also construct a new database of 1000 images and their pixelwise salient instance annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance on all public benchmarks for salient region detection as well as on our new dataset for salient instance segmentation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Li_Instance-Level_Salient_Object_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Guanbin Li, Yuan Xie, Liang Lin, Yizhou Yu
InstanceCut: From Edges to Instances With MultiCut	This work addresses the task of instance-aware semantic segmentation. Our key motivation is to design a simple method with a new modelling-paradigm, which therefore has a different trade-off between advantages and disadvantages compared to known approaches. Our approach, we term InstanceCut, represents the problem by two output modalities: (i) an instance-agnostic semantic segmentation and (ii) all instance-boundaries. The former is computed from a standard convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation, and the latter is derived from a new instance-aware edge detection model. To reason globally about the optimal partitioning of an image into instances, we combine these two modalities into a novel MultiCut formulation. We evaluate our approach on the challenging CityScapes dataset. Despite the conceptual simplicity of our approach, we achieve the best result among all published methods, and perform particularly well for rare object classes.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kirillov_InstanceCut_From_Edges_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Alexander Kirillov, Evgeny Levinkov, Bjoern Andres, Bogdan Savchynskyy, Carsten Rother

InterpoNet, a Brain Inspired Neural Network for Optical Flow Dense Interpolation	Sparse-to-dense interpolation for optical flow is a fundamental phase in the pipeline of most of the leading optical flow estimation algorithms. The current state-of-the-art method for interpolation, EpicFlow, is a local average method based on an edge aware geodesic distance. We propose a new data-driven sparse-to-dense interpolation algorithm based on a fully convolutional network. We draw inspiration from the filling-in process in the visual cortex and introduce lateral dependencies between neurons and multi-layer supervision into our learning process. We also show the importance of the image contour to the learning process. Our method is robust and outperforms EpicFlow on competitive optical flow benchmarks with several underlying matching algorithms. This leads to state-of-the-art performance on the Sintel and KITTI 2012 benchmarks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zweig_InterpoNet_a_Brain_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shay Zweig, Lior Wolf
Interpretable 3D Human Action Analysis With Temporal Convolutional Networks	The discriminative power of modern deep learning models for 3D human action recognition is growing ever so potent. In conjunction with the recent resurgence of 3D human action representation with 3D skeletons, the quality and the pace of recent progress have been significant. However, the inner workings of state-of-the-art learning based methods in 3D human action recognition still remain mostly black-box. In this work, we propose to use a new class of models known as Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (TCN) for 3D human action recognition. TCN provides us a way to explicitly learn readily interpretable spatio-temporal representations for 3D human action recognition. Through this work, we wish to take a step towards a spatio-temporal model that is easier to understand, explain and interpret. The resulting model, Res-TCN, achieves state-of-the-art results on the largest 3D human action recognition dataset, NTU-RGBD.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w20/html/Kim_Interpretable_3D_Human_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tae Soo Kim, Austin Reiter
Interpretable Structure-Evolving LSTM	This paper develops a general framework for learning interpretable data representation via Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks over hierarchal graph structures. Instead of learning LSTM models over the pre-fixed structures, we propose to further learn the intermediate interpretable multi-level graph structures in a progressive and stochastic way from data during the LSTM network optimization. We thus call this model the structure-evolving LSTM. In particular, starting with an initial element-level graph representation where each node is a small data element, the structure-evolving LSTM gradually evolves the multi-level graph representations by stochastically merging the graph nodes with high compatibilities along the stacked LSTM layers. In each LSTM layer, we estimate the compatibility of two connected nodes from their corresponding LSTM gate outputs, which is used to generate a merging probability. The candidate graph structures are accordingly generated where the nodes are grouped into cliques with their merging probabilities. We then produce the new graph structure with a Metropolis-Hasting algorithm, which alleviates the risk of getting stuck in local optimums by stochastic sampling with an acceptance probability. Once a graph structure is accepted, a higher-level graph is then constructed by taking the partitioned cliques as its nodes. During the evolving process, representation becomes more abstracted in higher-levels where redundant information is filtered out, allowing more efficient propagation of long-range data dependencies. We evaluate the effectiveness of structure-evolving LSTM in the application of semantic object parsing and demonstrate its advantage over state-of-the-art LSTM models on standard benchmarks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Liang_Interpretable_Structure-Evolving_LSTM_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xiaodan Liang, Liang Lin, Xiaohui Shen, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan, Eric P.

Interpreting CNN Models for Apparent Personality Trait Regression	This paper addresses the problem of automatically inferring personality traits of people talking to a camera. As in many other computer vision problems, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models have shown impressive results. However, despite of the success in terms of performance, it is unknown what internal representation emerges in the CNN. This paper presents a deep study on understanding why CNN models are performing surprisingly well in this complex problem. We use current techniques on CNN model interpretability, combined with face detection and Action Unit (AUs) recognition systems, to perform our quantitative studies. Our results show that: (1) face provides most of the discriminative information for personality trait inference, and (2) the internal CNN representations mainly analyze key face regions such as eyes, nose, and mouth. Finally, we study the contribution of AUs for personality trait inference, showing the influence of certain AUs in the facial trait judgments.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w26/html/Ventura_Interpreting_CNN_Models_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Carles Ventura, David Masip, Agata Lapedriza
Interspecies Knowledge Transfer for Facial Keypoint Detection	We present a method for localizing facial keypoints on animals by transferring knowledge gained from human faces. Instead of directly finetuning a network trained to detect keypoints on human faces to animal faces (which is sub-optimal since human and animal faces can look quite different), we propose to first adapt the animal images to the pre-trained human detection network by correcting for the differences in animal and human face shape. We first find the nearest human neighbors for each animal image using an unsupervised shape matching method. We use these matches to train a thin plate spline warping network to warp each animal face to look more human-like. The warping network is then jointly finetuned with a pre-trained human facial keypoint detection network using an animal dataset. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on both horse and sheep facial keypoint detection, and significant improvement over simple finetuning, especially when training data is scarce. Additionally, we present a new dataset with 3717 images with horse face and facial keypoint annotations.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Rashid_Interspecies_Knowledge_Transfer_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Maheen Rashid, Xiuye Gu, Yong Jae Lee
Intrinsic Grassmann Averages for Online Linear and Robust Subspace Learning	Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a fundamental method for estimating a linear subspace approximation to high-dimensional data. Many algorithms exist in literature to achieve a statistically robust version of PCA called RPCA. In this paper, we present a geometric framework for computing the principal linear subspaces in both situations that amounts to computing the intrinsic average on the space of all subspaces (the Grassmann manifold). Points on this manifold are defined as the subspaces spanned by K-tuples of observations. We show that the intrinsic Grassmann average of these subspaces coincide with the principal components of the observations when they are drawn from a Gaussian distribution. Similar results are also shown to hold for the RPCA. Further, we propose an efficient online algorithm to do subspace averaging which is of linear complexity in terms of number of samples and has a linear convergence rate. When the data has outliers, our proposed online robust subspace averaging algorithm shows significant performance (accuracy and computation time) gain over a recently published RPCA methods with publicly accessible code. We have demonstrated competitive performance of our proposed online subspace algorithm method on one synthetic and two real data sets. Experimental results depicting stability of our proposed method are also presented. Furthermore, on two real outlier corrupted datasets, we present comparison experiments showing lower reconstruction error using our online RPCA algorithm. In terms of reconstruction error and time required, both our algorithms outperform the competition.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chakraborty_Intrinsic_Grassmann_Averages_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Rudrasis Chakraborty, Soren Hauberg, Baba C.

Inverse Compositional Spatial Transformer Networks	In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between the classical Lucas & Kanade (LK) algorithm and the emerging topic of Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs). STNs are of interest to the vision and learning communities due to their natural ability to combine alignment and classification within the same theoretical framework. Inspired by the Inverse Compositional (IC) variant of the LK algorithm, we present Inverse Compositional Spatial Transformer Networks (IC-STNs). We demonstrate that IC-STNs can achieve better performance than conventional STNs with less model capacity; in particular, we show superior performance in pure image alignment tasks as well as joint alignment/classification problems on real-world problems.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lin_Inverse_Compositional_Spatial_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chen-Hsuan Lin, Simon Lucey
Investigating Nuisance Factors in Face Recognition With DCNN Representation	"Deep learning based approaches proved to be dramatically effective to address many computer vision applications, including ""face recognition in the wild"". It has been extensively demonstrated that methods exploiting Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) are powerful enough to overcome to a great extent many problems that negatively affected computer vision algorithms based on hand-crafted features. These problems include variations in illumination, pose, expression and occlusion, to mention some. The DCNNs excellent discriminative power comes from the fact that they learn low- and high-level representations directly from the raw image data. Considering this, it can be assumed that the performance of a DCNN are influenced by the characteristics of the raw image data that are fed to the network. In this work, we evaluate the effect of different bounding box dimensions, alignment, positioning and data source on face recognition using DCNNs, and present a thorough evaluation on two well known, public DCNN architectures."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w6/html/Ferrari_Investigating_Nuisance_Factors_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Claudio Ferrari, Giuseppe Lisanti, Stefano Berretti, Alberto Del Bimbo
Iris Liveness Detection by Relative Distance Comparisons	The focus of this paper is on presentation attack detection for the iris biometrics, which measures the pattern within the colored concentric circle of the subjects' eyes, to authenticate an individual to a generic user verification system. Unlike previous deep learning methods that use single convolutional neural network architectures, this paper develops a framework built upon triplet convolutional networks that takes as input two real iris patches and a fake patch or two fake patches and a genuine patch. The aim is to increase the number of training samples and to generate a representation that separates the real from the fake iris patches. The smaller architecture provides a way to do early stopping based on the liveness of single patches rather than the whole image. The matching is performed by computing the distance with respect to a reference set of real and fake examples. The proposed approach allows for real-time processing using a smaller network and provides equal or better than state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets of photo-based and contact lens presentation attacks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w6/html/Pala_Iris_Liveness_Detection_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Federico Pala, Bir Bhanu
Iris Super-Resolution Using Iterative Neighbor Embedding	Iris recognition research is heading towards enabling more relaxed acquisition conditions. This has effects on the quality and resolution of acquired images, severely affecting the accuracy of recognition systems if not tackled appropriately. In this paper, we evaluate a super-resolution algorithm used to reconstruct iris images based on iterative neighbor embedding of local image patches which tries to represent input low-resolution patches while preserving the geometry of the original high-resolution space. To this end, the geometry of the low- and high-resolution manifolds are jointly considered during the reconstruction process. We validate the system with a database of 1,872 near-infrared iris images, while fusion of two iris comparators has been adopted to improve recognition performance. The presented approach is substantially superior to bilinear/bicubic interpolations at very low resolutions, and it also outperforms a previous PCA-based iris reconstruction approach which only considers the geometry of the low-resolution manifold during the reconstruction process.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w6/html/Alonso-Fernandez_Iris_Super-Resolution_Using_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Fernando Alonso-Fernandez, Reuben A.

It's Written All Over Your Face: Full-Face Appearance-Based Gaze Estimation	Eye gaze is an important non-verbal cue for human affect analysis. Recent gaze estimation work indicated that information from the full face region can benefit performance. Pushing this idea further, we propose an appearance-based method that, in contrast to a long-standing line of work in computer vision, only takes the full face image as input. Our method encodes the face image using a convolutional neural network with spatial weights applied on the feature maps to flexibly suppress or enhance information in different facial regions. Through extensive evaluation, we show that our full-face method significantly outperforms the state of the art for both 2D and 3D gaze estimation, achieving improvements of up to 14.3% on MPIIGaze and 27.7% on EYEDIAP for person-independent 3D gaze estimation. We further show that this improvement is consistent across different illumination conditions and gaze directions and particularly pronounced for the most challenging extreme head poses.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w41/html/Bulling_Its_Written_All_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xucong Zhang, Yusuke Sugano, Mario Fritz, Andreas Bulling
Joint 3D Human Motion Capture and Physical Analysis From Monocular Videos	Motion analysis is often restricted to a laboratory setup with multiple cameras and force sensors which requires expensive equipment and knowledgeable operators. Therefore it lacks in simplicity and flexibility. We propose an algorithm combining monocular 3D pose estimation with physics-based modeling to introduce a statistical framework for fast and robust 3D motion analysis from 2D video-data. We use a factorization approach to learn 3D motion coefficients and join them with physical parameters, that describe the dynamic of a mass-spring-model. Our approach does neither require additional force measurement nor torque optimization and only uses a single camera while allowing to estimate unobservable torques in the human body. We show that our algorithm improves the monocular 3D reconstruction by enforcing plausible human motion and resolving the ambiguity of camera and object motion. The performance is evaluated on different motions and multiple test data sets as well as on challenging outdoor sequences.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w1/html/Zell_Joint_3D_Human_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Petrissa Zell, Bastian Wandt, Bodo Rosenhahn
Joint Detection and Identification Feature Learning for Person Search	Existing person re-identification benchmarks and methods mainly focus on matching cropped pedestrian images between queries and candidates. However, it is different from real-world scenarios where the annotations of pedestrian bounding boxes are unavailable and the target person needs to be searched from a gallery of whole scene images. To close the gap, we propose a new deep learning framework for person search. Instead of breaking it down into two separate tasks---pedestrian detection and person re-identification, we jointly handle both aspects in a single convolutional neural network. An Online Instance Matching (OIM) loss function is proposed to train the network effectively, which is scalable to datasets with numerous identities. To validate our approach, we collect and annotate a large-scale benchmark dataset for person search. It contains 18,184 images, 8,432 identities, and 96,143 pedestrian bounding boxes. Experiments show that our framework outperforms other separate approaches, and the proposed OIM loss function converges much faster and better than the conventional Softmax loss.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xiao_Joint_Detection_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tong Xiao, Shuang Li, Bochao Wang, Liang Lin, Xiaogang Wang
Joint Discriminative Bayesian Dictionary and Classifier Learning	We propose to jointly learn a Discriminative Bayesian dictionary along a linear classifier using coupled Beta-Bernoulli Processes. Our representation model uses separate base measures for the dictionary and the classifier, but associates them to the class-specific training data using the same Bernoulli distributions. The Bernoulli distributions control the frequency with which the factors (e.g. dictionary atoms) are used in data representations, and they are inferred while accounting for the class labels in our approach. To further encourage discrimination in the dictionary, our model uses separate (sets of) Bernoulli distributions to represent data from different classes. Our approach adaptively learns the association between the dictionary atoms and the class labels while tailoring the classifier to this relation with a joint inference over the dictionary and the classifier. Once a test sample is represented over the dictionary, its representation is accurately labelled by the classifier due to the strong coupling between the dictionary and the classifier. We derive the Gibbs Sampling equations for our joint representation model and test our approach for face, object, scene and action recognition to establish its effectiveness.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Akhtar_Joint_Discriminative_Bayesian_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Naveed Akhtar, Ajmal Mian, Fatih Porikli
Joint Gap Detection and Inpainting of Line Drawings	We propose a novel data-driven approach for automatically detecting and completing gaps in line drawings with a Convolutional Neural Network. In the case of existing inpainting approaches for natural images, masks indicating the missing regions are generally required as input. Here, we show that line drawings have enough structures that can be learned by the CNN to allow automatic detection and completion of the gaps without any such input. Thus, our method can find the gaps in line drawings and complete them without user interaction. Furthermore, the completion realistically conserves thickness and curvature of the line segments. All the necessary heuristics for such realistic line completion are learned naturally from a dataset of line drawings, where various patterns of line completion are generated on the fly as training pairs to improve the model generalization. We evaluate our method qualitatively on a diverse set of challenging line drawings and also provide quantitative results with a user study, where it significantly outperforms the state of the art.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Sasaki_Joint_Gap_Detection_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Kazuma Sasaki, Satoshi Iizuka, Edgar Simo-Serra, Hiroshi Ishikawa
Joint Geometrical and Statistical Alignment for Visual Domain Adaptation	This paper presents a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method for cross-domain visual recognition. We propose a unified framework that reduces the shift between domains both statistically and geometrically, referred to as Joint Geometrical and Statistical Alignment (JGSA). Specifically, we learn two coupled projections that project the source domain and target domain data into low-dimensional subspaces where the geometrical shift and distribution shift are reduced simultaneously. The objective function can be solved efficiently in a closed form. Extensive experiments have verified that the proposed method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods on a synthetic dataset and three different real world cross-domain visual recognition tasks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Joint_Geometrical_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jing Zhang, Wanqing Li, Philip Ogunbona
Joint Graph Decomposition & Node Labeling: Problem, Algorithms, Applications	We state a combinatorial optimization problem whose feasible solutions define both a decomposition and a node labeling of a given graph. This problem offers a common mathematical abstraction of seemingly unrelated computer vision tasks, including instance-separating semantic segmentation, articulated human body pose estimation and multiple object tracking. Conceptually, it generalizes the unconstrained integer quadratic program and the minimum cost lifted multicut problem, both of which are NP-hard. In order to find feasible solutions efficiently, we define two local search algorithms that converge monotonously to a local optimum, offering a feasible solution at any time. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms in tackling computer vision tasks, we apply them to instances of the problem that we construct from published data, using published algorithms. We report state-of-the-art application-specific accuracy in the three above-mentioned applications.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Levinkov_Joint_Graph_Decomposition_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Evgeny Levinkov, Jonas Uhrig, Siyu Tang, Mohamed Omran, Eldar Insafutdinov, Alexander Kirillov, Carsten Rother, Thomas Brox, Bernt Schiele, Bjoern Andres
Joint Intensity and Spatial Metric Learning for Robust Gait Recognition	This paper describes a joint intensity metric learning method to improve the robustness of gait recognition with silhouette-based descriptors such as gait energy images. Because existing methods often use the difference of image intensities between a matching pair (e.g., the absolute difference of gait energies for the l_1-norm) to measure a dissimilarity, large intrasubject differences derived from covariate conditions (e.g., large gait energies caused by carried objects vs. small gait energies caused by the background), may wash out subtle intersubject differences (e.g., the difference of middle-level gait energies derived from motion differences). We therefore introduce a metric on joint intensity to mitigate the large intrasubject differences as well as leverage the subtle intersubject differences. More specifically, we formulate the joint intensity and spatial metric learning in a unified framework and alternately optimize it by linear or ranking support vector machines. Experiments using the OU-ISIR treadmill data set B with the largest clothing variation and large population data set with bag, b version containing carrying status in the wild demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Makihara_Joint_Intensity_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yasushi Makihara, Atsuyuki Suzuki, Daigo Muramatsu, Xiang Li, Yasushi Yagi
Joint Learning From Earth Observation and OpenStreetMap Data to Get Faster Better Semantic Maps	We investigate the use of OSM data for semantic labeling of EO images. Deep neural networks have been used in the past for remote sensing data classification from various sensors, including multispectral, hyperspectral, Radar and Lidar data. However, OSM is an abundant data source that has already been used as ground truth data, but rarely exploited as an input information layer. We study different use cases and deep network architectures to leverage this OSM data for semantic labeling of aerial and satellite images. Especially, we look into fusion based architectures and coarse-to-fine segmentation to include the OSM layer into multispectral-based deep fully convolutional networks. We illustrate how these methods can be used successfully on two public datasets: the ISPRS Potsdam and the DFC2017. We show that OSM data can efficiently be integrated into the vision-based deep learning models and that it significantly improves both the accuracy performance and the convergence.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w18/html/Audebert_Joint_Learning_From_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Nicolas Audebert, Bertrand Le Saux, Sebastien Lefevre

We evaluate design choices in terms of which intermediate representations should be transferred to the server and back to the mobile device, and present a graph-based solution that can update the optimal joint mobile-cloud computation separation as the hardware configuration or user's requirements change.

Joint Multi-Person Pose Estimation and Semantic Part Segmentation	Human pose estimation and semantic part segmentation are two complementary tasks in computer vision. In this paper, we propose to solve the two tasks jointly for natural multi-person images, in which the estimated pose provides object-level shape prior to regularize part segments while the part-level segments constrain the variation of pose locations. Specifically, we first train two fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), namely Pose FCN and Part FCN, to provide initial estimation of pose joint potential and semantic part potential. Then, to refine pose joint location, the two types of potentials are fused with a fully-connected conditional random field (FCRF), where a novel segment-joint smoothness term is used to encourage semantic and spatial consistency between parts and joints. To refine part segments, the refined pose and the original part potential are integrated through a Part FCN, where the skeleton feature from pose serves as additional regularization cues for part segments. Finally, to reduce the complexity of the FCRF, we induce human detection boxes and infer the graph inside each box, making the inference forty times faster. Since there's no dataset that contains both part segments and pose labels, we extend the PASCAL VOC part dataset with human pose joints and perform extensive experiments to compare our method against several most recent strategies. We show that our algorithm surpasses competing methods by 10.6% in pose estimation with much faster speed and by 1.5% in semantic part segmentation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xia_Joint_Multi-Person_Pose_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Fangting Xia, Peng Wang, Xianjie Chen, Alan L.

Joint Registration and Representation Learning for Unconstrained Face Identification	Recent advances in deep learning have resulted in human-level performances on popular unconstrained face datasets including Labeled Faces in the Wild and YouTube Faces. To further advance research, IJB-A benchmark was recently introduced with more challenges especially in the form of extreme head poses. Registration of such faces is quite demanding and often requires laborious procedures like facial landmark localization. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Neural Networks based data-driven approach which learns to simultaneously register and represent faces. We validate the proposed scheme on template based unconstrained face identification. Here, a template contains multiple media in the form of images and video frames. Unlike existing methods which synthesize all template media information at feature level, we propose to keep the template media intact. Instead, we represent gallery templates by their trained one-vs-rest discriminative models and then employ a Bayesian strategy which optimally fuses decisions of all medias in a query template. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme on IJB-A, YouTube Celebrities and COX datasets where our approach achieves significant relative performance boosts of 3.6%, 21.6% and 12.8% respectively.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Hayat_Joint_Registration_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Munawar Hayat, Salman H.

Joint Sequence Learning and Cross-Modality Convolution for 3D Biomedical Segmentation	Deep learning models such as convolutional neural network have been widely used in 3D biomedical segmentation and achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, most of them often adapt a single modality or stack multiple modalities as different input channels, which ignores the correlations among them. To leverage the multi-modalities, we propose a deep convolution encoder-decoder structure with fusion layers to incorporate different modalities of MRI data. In addition, we exploit convolutional LSTM (convLSTM) to model a sequence of 2D slices, and jointly learn the multi-modalities and convLSTM in an end-to-end manner. To avoid converging to the certain labels, we adopt a re-weighting scheme and two phase training to handle the label imbalance. Experimental results on BRATS-2015 show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art biomedical segmentation approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tseng_Joint_Sequence_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Kuan-Lun Tseng, Yen-Liang Lin, Winston Hsu, Chung-Yang Huang
Jointly Learning Energy Expenditures and Activities Using Egocentric Multimodal Signals	Physiological signals such as heart rate can provide valuable information about an individual's state and activity. However, existing work on computer vision has not yet explored leveraging these signals to enhance egocentric video understanding. In this work, we propose a model for reasoning on multimodal data to jointly predict activities and energy expenditures. We use heart rate signals as privileged self-supervision to derive energy expenditure in a training stage. A multitask objective is used to jointly optimize the two tasks. Additionally, we introduce a dataset that contains 31 hours of egocentric video augmented with heart rate and acceleration signals. This study can lead to new applications such as a visual calorie counter.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Nakamura_Jointly_Learning_Energy_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Katsuyuki Nakamura, Serena Yeung, Alexandre Alahi, Li Fei-Fei
Kernalised Multi-Resolution Convnet for Visual Tracking	Discriminative Correlation Filters (DCF) have demonstrated excellent performance for high-speed visual object tracking. Built upon their seminar work, there has been a plethora of recent improvements relying on convolutional neural network. In this paper, we go beyond the conventional DCF framework and propose a Kernalised Multi-resolution Convnet (KMC) formulation that utilises hierarchical response maps to directly output the target movement. The performance of this transfer learning paradigm is on par with a variety of state-of-the-art approaches and when directly deployed the learnt network to predict the unseen challenging UAV tracking dataset. Moreover, the transfered multi-reslution CNN renders it possible to be integrated into the RNN temporal learning framework, therefore opening the door on the end-to-end temporal deep learning (TDL) for visual tracking.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w37/html/Wu_Kernalised_Multi-Resolution_Convnet_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Di Wu, Wenbin Zou, Xia Li, Yong Zhao
Kernel Pooling for Convolutional Neural Networks	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Bilinear Pooling, initially in their full form and later using compact representations, have yielded impressive performance gains on a wide range of visual tasks, including fine-grained visual categorization, visual question answering, face recognition, and description of texture and style. The key to their success lies in the spatially invariant modeling of pairwise (2nd order) feature interactions. In this work, we propose a general pooling framework that captures higher order interactions of features in the form of kernels. We demonstrate how to approximate kernels such as Gaussian RBF up to a given order using compact explicit feature maps in a parameter-free manner. Combined with CNNs, the composition of the kernel can be learned from data in an end-to-end fashion via error back-propagation. The proposed kernel pooling scheme is evaluated in terms of both kernel approximation error and visual recognition accuracy. Experimental evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on commonly used fine-grained recognition datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Cui_Kernel_Pooling_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yin Cui, Feng Zhou, Jiang Wang, Xiao Liu, Yuanqing Lin, Serge Belongie
Kernel Square-Loss Exemplar Machines for Image Retrieval	Zepeda and Perez have recently demonstrated the promise of the exemplar SVM (ESVM) as a feature encoder for image retrieval. This paper extends this approach in several directions: We first show that replacing the hinge loss by the square loss in the ESVM cost function significantly reduces encoding time with negligible effect on accuracy. We call this model square-loss exemplar machine, or SLEM. We then introduce a kernelized SLEM which can be implemented efficiently through low-rank matrix decomposition, and displays improved performance. Both SLEM variants exploit the fact that the negative examples are fixed, so most of the SLEM computational complexity is relegated to an offline process independent of the positive examples. Our experiments establish the performance and computational advantages of our approach using a large array of base features and standard image retrieval datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Rezende_Kernel_Square-Loss_Exemplar_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Rafael S.

KillingFusion: Non-Rigid 3D Reconstruction Without Correspondences	We introduce a geometry-driven approach for real-time 3D reconstruction of deforming surfaces from a single RGB-D stream without any templates or shape priors. To this end, we tackle the problem of non-rigid registration by level set evolution without explicit correspondence search. Given a pair of signed distance fields (SDFs) representing the shapes of interest, we estimate a dense deformation field that aligns them. It is defined as a displacement vector field of the same resolution as the SDFs and is determined iteratively via variational minimization. To ensure it generates plausible shapes, we propose a novel regularizer that imposes local rigidity by requiring the deformation to be a smooth and approximately Killing vector field, i.e. generating nearly isometric motions. Moreover, we enforce that the level set property of unity gradient magnitude is preserved over iterations. As a result, KillingFusion reliably reconstructs objects that are undergoing topological changes and fast inter-frame motion. In addition to incrementally building a model from scratch, our system can also deform complete surfaces. We demonstrate these capabilities on several public datasets and introduce our own sequences that permit both qualitative and quantitative comparison to related approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Slavcheva_KillingFusion_Non-Rigid_3D_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Miroslava Slavcheva, Maximilian Baust, Daniel Cremers, Slobodan Ilic
Knowing When to Look: Adaptive Attention via a Visual Sentinel for Image Captioning	"Attention-based neural encoder-decoder frameworks have been widely adopted for image captioning. Most methods force visual attention to be active for every generated word. However, the decoder likely requires little to no visual information from the image to predict non-visual words such as ""the"" and ""of"". Other words that may seem visual can often be predicted reliably just from the language model e.g., ""sign"" after ""behind a red stop"" or ""phone"" following ""talking on a cell"". In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive attention model with a visual sentinel. At each time step, our model decides whether to attend to the image (and if so, to which regions) or to the visual sentinel. The model decides whether to attend to the image and where, in order to extract meaningful information for sequential word generation. We test our method on the COCO image captioning 2015 challenge dataset and Flickr30K. Our approach sets the new state-of-the-art by a significant margin."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lu_Knowing_When_to_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jiasen Lu, Caiming Xiong, Devi Parikh, Richard Socher
Knowledge Acquisition for Visual Question Answering via Iterative Querying	Humans possess an extraordinary ability to learn new skills and new knowledge for problem solving. Such learning ability is also required by an automatic model to deal with arbitrary, open-ended questions in the visual world. We propose a neural-based approach to acquiring task- driven information for visual question answering (VQA). Our model proposes queries to actively acquire relevant information from external auxiliary data. Supporting evidence from either human-curated or automatic sources is encoded and stored into a memory bank. We show that acquiring task-driven evidence effectively improves model performance on both the Visual7W and VQA datasets; moreover, these queries offer certain level of interpretability in our iterative QA model.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhu_Knowledge_Acquisition_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yuke Zhu, Joseph J.

L2-Net: Deep Learning of Discriminative Patch Descriptor in Euclidean Space	The research focus of designing local patch descriptors has gradually shifted from handcrafted ones (e.g., SIFT) to learned ones. In this paper, we propose to learn high per- formance descriptor in Euclidean space via the Convolu- tional Neural Network (CNN). Our method is distinctive in four aspects: (i) We propose a progressive sampling strat- egy which enables the network to access billions of train- ing samples in a few epochs. (ii) Derived from the ba- sic concept of local patch matching problem, we empha- size the relative distance between descriptors. (iii) Extra supervision is imposed on the intermediate feature maps. (iv) Compactness of the descriptor is taken into account. The proposed network is named as L2-Net since the out- put descriptor can be matched in Euclidean space by L2 distance. L2-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Brown datasets [16], Oxford dataset [18] and the new- ly proposed Hpatches dataset [11]. The good generaliza- tion ability shown by experiments indicates that L2-Net can serve as a direct substitution of the existing handcrafted de- scriptors. The pre-trained L2-Net is publicly available.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tian_L2-Net_Deep_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yurun Tian, Bin Fan, Fuchao Wu
LCDet: Low-Complexity Fully-Convolutional Neural Networks for Object Detection in Embedded Systems	Deep convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are the state-of-the-art performers for object detection task. It is well known that object detection requires more computation and memory than image classification. Thus the consolidation of a CNN-based object detection for an embedded system is more challenging. In this work, we propose LCDet, a fully-convolutional neural network for generic object detection that aims to work in embedded systems. We design and develop an end-to-end TensorFlow(TF)-based model. Additionally, we employ 8-bit quantization on the learned weights. We use face detection as a use case. Our TF-Slim based network can predict different faces of different shapes and sizes in a single forward pass. Our experimental results show that the LCDet achieves comparative accuracy comparing with state-of-the-art CNN-based face detection methods, while reducing the model size by 12x and memory-BW by 16x comparing with one of the best real-time CNN-based object detectors YOLO.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w4/html/Tripathi_LCDet_Low-Complexity_Fully-Convolutional_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Subarna Tripathi, Gokce Dane, Byeongkeun Kang, Vasudev Bhaskaran, Truong Nguyen
LCNN: Lookup-Based Convolutional Neural Network	Porting state of the art deep learning algorithms to resource constrained compute platforms (e.g. VR, AR, wearables) is extremely challenging. We propose a fast, compact, and accurate model for convolutional neural networks that enables efficient learning and inference. We introduce LCNN, a lookup-based convolutional neural network that encodes convolutions by few lookups to a dictionary that is trained to cover the space of weights in CNNs. Training LCNN involves jointly learning a dictionary and a small set of linear combinations. The size of the dictionary naturally traces a spectrum of trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy. Our experimental results on ImageNet challenge show that LCNN can offer 3.2x speedup while achieving 55.1% top-1 accuracy using AlexNet architecture. Our fastest LCNN offers 37.6x speed up over AlexNet while maintaining 44.3% top-1 accuracy. LCNN not only offers dramatic speed ups at inference, but it also enables efficient training. In this paper, we show the benefits of LCNN in few-shot learning and few-iteration learning, two crucial aspects of on-device training of deep learning models.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Bagherinezhad_LCNN_Lookup-Based_Convolutional_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hessam Bagherinezhad, Mohammad Rastegari, Ali Farhadi
LCR-Net: Localization-Classification-Regression for Human Pose	We propose an end-to-end architecture for joint 2D and 3D human pose estimation in natural images. Key to our approach is the generation and scoring of a number of pose proposals per image, which allows us to predict 2D and 3D pose of multiple people simultaneously. Hence, our approach does not require an approximate localization of the humans for initialization. Our architecture, named LCR-Net, contains 3 main components: 1) the pose proposal generator that suggests potential poses at different locations in the image; 2) a classifier that scores the different pose proposals; and 3) a regressor that refines pose proposals both in 2D and 3D. All three stages share the convolutional feature layers and are trained jointly. The final pose estimation is obtained by integrating over neighboring pose hypotheses, which is shown to improve over a standard non maximum suppression algorithm. Our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art in 3D pose estimation on Human3.6M, a controlled environment. Moreover, it shows promising results on real images for both single and multi-person subsets of the MPII 2D pose benchmark.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Rogez_LCR-Net_Localization-Classification-Regression_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Gregory Rogez, Philippe Weinzaepfel, Cordelia Schmid
LSTM Self-Supervision for Detailed Behavior Analysis	Behavior analysis provides a crucial non-invasive and easily accessible diagnostic tool for biomedical research. A detailed analysis of posture changes during skilled motor tasks can reveal distinct functional deficits and their restoration during recovery. Our specific scenario is based on a neuroscientific study of rodents recovering from a large sensorimotor cortex stroke and skilled forelimb grasping is being recorded. Given large amounts of unlabeled videos that are recorded during such long-term studies, we seek an approach that captures fine-grained details of posture and its change during rehabilitation without costly manual supervision. Therefore, we utilize self-supervision to automatically learn accurate posture and behavior representations for analyzing motor function. Learning our model depends on the following fundamental elements: (i) limb detection based on a fully convolutional network is ini- tialized solely using motion information, (ii) a novel self- supervised training of LSTMs using only temporal permu- tation yields a detailed representation of behavior, and (iii) back-propagation of this sequence representation also im- proves the description of individual postures. We establish a novel test dataset with expert annotations for evaluation of fine-grained behavior analysis. Moreover, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by successfully applying it to self-supervised learning of human posture on two standard benchmark datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Brattoli_LSTM_Self-Supervision_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Biagio Brattoli, Uta Buchler, Anna-Sophia Wahl, Martin E.

Large Kernel Matters -- Improve Semantic Segmentation by Global Convolutional Network	Convolution Neural Network (CNN) has boosted the per- formanceofalotofcomputervisiontasks, likeimageclassi- fication [31], segmentation [25], and detection [28]. Based on the observations from [31, 32, 14], recent model design- ers prefer to employ stacking of small kernels, like 3 x 3 over large-size filters. However, in the field of semantic seg- mentation, where we need to perform dense per-pixel pre- diction, we find that large kernel plays an important role to relieve the contradictories when optimizing the classi- fication and localization tasks simultaneously. Following the design principle of large-size kernel, We propose the Global Convolutional Network to address both the classi- fication and localization issue in the semantic segmentation task. To further refine the object category boundaries, we presentBoundaryRefinementblockbasedonresidualstruc- ture. Qualitatively, our model achieves state-of-art perfor- mance on two public benchmarks and outperforms previous results on a large margin, 82.2% (vs 80.2%) on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and 76.9% (vs 71.8%) on Cityscapes dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Peng_Large_Kernel_Matters_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chao Peng, Xiangyu Zhang, Gang Yu, Guiming Luo, Jian Sun
Large Margin Object Tracking With Circulant Feature Maps	Structured output support vector machine (SVM) based tracking algorithms have shown favorable performance recently. Nonetheless, the time-consuming candidate sampling and complex optimization limit their real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a novel large margin object tracking method which absorbs the strong discriminative ability from structured output SVM and speeds up by the correlation filter algorithm significantly. Secondly, a multimodal target detection technique is proposed to improve the target localization precision and prevent model drift introduced by similar objects or background noise. Thirdly, we exploit the feedback from high-confidence tracking results to avoid the model corruption problem. We implement two versions of the proposed tracker with the representations from both conventional hand-crafted and deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) based features to validate the strong compatibility of the algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed tracker performs superiorly against several state-of-the-art algorithms on the challenging benchmark sequences while runs at speed in excess of 80 frames per second.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_Large_Margin_Object_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mengmeng Wang, Yong Liu, Zeyi Huang
Latent Multi-View Subspace Clustering	In this paper, we propose a novel Latent Multi-view Subspace Clustering (LMSC) method, which clusters data points with latent representation and simultaneously explores underlying complementary information from multiple views. Unlike most existing single view subspace clustering methods that reconstruct data points using original features, our method seeks the underlying latent representation and simultaneously performs data reconstruction based on the learned latent representation. With the complementarity of multiple views, the latent representation could depict data themselves more comprehensively than each single view individually, accordingly makes subspace representation more accurate and robust as well. The proposed method is intuitive and can be optimized efficiently by using the Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier with Alternating Direction Minimization (ALM-ADM) algorithm. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets have validated the effectiveness of our proposed method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Latent_Multi-View_Subspace_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Changqing Zhang, Qinghua Hu, Huazhu Fu, Pengfei Zhu, Xiaochun Cao
Lean Crowdsourcing: Combining Humans and Machines in an Online System	We introduce a method to greatly reduce the amount of redundant annotations required when crowdsourcing annotations such as bounding boxes, parts, and class labels. For example, if two Mechanical Turkers happen to click on the same pixel location when annotating a part in a given image--an event that is very unlikely to occur by random chance--, it is a strong indication that the location is correct. A similar type of confidence can be obtained if a single Turker happened to agree with a computer vision estimate. We thus incrementally collect a variable number of worker annotations per image based on online estimates of confidence. This is done using a sequential estimation of risk over a probabilistic model that combines worker skill, image difficulty, and an incrementally trained computer vision model. We develop specialized models and algorithms for binary annotation, part keypoint annotation, and sets of bounding box annotations. We show that our method can reduce annotation time by a factor of 4-11 for binary filtering of websearch results, 2-4 for annotation of boxes of pedestrians in images, while in many cases also reducing annotation error. We will make an end-to-end version of our system publicly available.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Branson_Lean_Crowdsourcing_Combining_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Steve Branson, Grant Van Horn, Pietro Perona
Learned Contextual Feature Reweighting for Image Geo-Localization	We address the problem of large scale image geo-localization where the location of an image is estimated by identifying geo-tagged reference images depicting the same place. We propose a novel model for learning image representations that integrates context-aware feature reweighting in order to effectively focus on regions that positively contribute to geo-localization. In particular, we introduce a Contextual Reweighting Network (CRN) that predicts the importance of each region in the feature map based on the image context. Our model is learned end-to-end for the image geo-localization task, and requires no annotation other than image geo-tags for training. In experimental results, the proposed approach significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on the standard geo-localization benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate that our CRN discovers task-relevant contexts without any additional supervision.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kim_Learned_Contextual_Feature_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hyo Jin Kim, Enrique Dunn, Jan-Michael Frahm
Learning Adaptive Receptive Fields for Deep Image Parsing Network	In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to regulate receptive field in deep image parsing network automatically. Unlike previous works which have stressed much importance on obtaining better receptive fields using manually selected dilated convolutional kernels, our approach uses two affine transformation layers in the network's backbone and operates on feature maps. Feature maps will be inflated/shrinked by the new layer and therefore receptive fields in following layers are changed accordingly. By end-to-end training, the whole framework is data-driven without laborious manual intervention. The proposed method is generic across dataset and different tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on both general parsing task and face parsing task as concrete examples to demonstrate the method's superior regulation ability over manual designs.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wei_Learning_Adaptive_Receptive_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhen Wei, Yao Sun, Jinqiao Wang, Hanjiang Lai, Si Liu
Learning Barycentric Representations of 3D Shapes for Sketch-Based 3D Shape Retrieval	Retrieving 3D shapes with sketches is a challenging problem since 2D sketches and 3D shapes are from two heterogeneous domains, which results in large discrepancy between them. In this paper, we propose to learn barycenters of 2D projections of 3D shapes for sketch-based 3D shape retrieval. Specifically, we first use two deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract deep features of sketches and 2D projections of 3D shapes. For 3D shapes, we then compute the Wasserstein barycenters of deep features of multiple projections to form a barycentric representation. Finally, by constructing a metric network, a discriminative loss is formulated on the Wasserstein barycenters of 3D shapes and sketches in the deep feature space to learn discriminative and compact 3D shape and sketch features for retrieval. The proposed method is evaluated on the SHREC'13 and SHREC'14 sketch track benchmark datasets. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our proposed method can significantly improve the retrieval performance.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xie_Learning_Barycentric_Representations_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jin Xie, Guoxian Dai, Fan Zhu, Yi Fang
Learning Category-Specific 3D Shape Models From Weakly Labeled 2D Images	Recently, researchers have made great processes to build category-specific 3D shape models from 2D images with manual annotations consisting of class labels, keypoints, and ground truth figure-ground segmentations. However, the annotation of figure-ground segmentations is still labor-intensive and time-consuming. To further alleviate the burden of providing such manual annotations, we make the earliest effort to learn category-specific 3D shape models by only using weakly labeled 2D images. By revealing the underlying relationship between the tasks of common object segmentation and category-specific 3D shape reconstruction, we propose a novel framework to jointly solve these two problems along a cluster-level learning curriculum. Comprehensive experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC benchmark demonstrate that the category-specific 3D shape models trained using our weakly supervised learning framework could, to some extent, approach the performance of the state-of-the-art methods using expensive manual segmentation annotations. In addition, the experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of using 3D shape models for helping common object segmentation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Learning_Category-Specific_3D_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Dingwen Zhang, Junwei Han, Yang Yang, Dong Huang
Learning Cross-Modal Deep Representations for Robust Pedestrian Detection	This paper presents a novel method for detecting pedestrians under adverse illumination conditions. Our approach relies on a novel cross-modality learning framework and it is based on two main phases. First, given a multimodal dataset, a deep convolutional network is employed to learn a non-linear mapping, modeling the relations between RGB and thermal data. Then, the learned feature representations are transferred to a second deep network, which receives as input an RGB image and outputs the detection results. In this way, features which are both discriminative and robust to bad illumination conditions are learned. Importantly, at test time, only the second pipeline is considered and no thermal data are required. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on the challenging KAIST multispectral pedestrian dataset and it is competitive with previous methods on the popular Caltech dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xu_Learning_Cross-Modal_Deep_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Dan Xu, Wanli Ouyang, Elisa Ricci, Xiaogang Wang, Nicu Sebe
Learning Cross-Modal Embeddings for Cooking Recipes and Food Images	In this paper, we introduce Recipe1M, a new large-scale, structured corpus of over 1m cooking recipes and 800k food images. As the largest publicly available collection of recipe data, Recipe1M affords the ability to train high-capacity models on aligned, multi-modal data. Accordingly, we train a neural network to find a joint embedding of recipes and images that yields impressive results on an image-recipe retrieval task. Additionally, we demonstrate that regularization via the addition of a high-level, semantic classification objective improves performance to rival that of humans and enables semantic vector arithmetic. We postulate that these embeddings will provide a basis for further exploration of the Recipe1M dataset and food and cooking in general.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Salvador_Learning_Cross-Modal_Embeddings_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Amaia Salvador, Nicholas Hynes, Yusuf Aytar, Javier Marin, Ferda Ofli, Ingmar Weber, Antonio Torralba
Learning Deep Binary Descriptor With Multi-Quantization	In this paper, we propose an unsupervised feature learning method called deep binary descriptor with multi-quantization (DBD-MQ) for visual matching. Existing learning-based binary descriptors such as compact binary face descriptor (CBFD) and DeepBit utilize the rigid sign function for binarization despite of data distributions, thereby suffering from severe quantization loss. In order to address the limitation, our DBD-MQ considers the binarization as a multi-quantization task. Specifically, we apply a K-AutoEncoders (KAEs) network to jointly learn the parameters and the binarization functions under a deep learning framework, so that discriminative binary descriptors can be obtained with a fine-grained multi-quantization. Extensive experimental results on different visual analysis including patch retrieval, image matching and image retrieval show that our DBD-MQ outperforms most existing binary feature descriptors.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Duan_Learning_Deep_Binary_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yueqi Duan, Jiwen Lu, Ziwei Wang, Jianjiang Feng, Jie Zhou
Learning Deep CNN Denoiser Prior for Image Restoration	Model-based optimization methods and discriminative learning methods have been the two dominant strategies for solving various inverse problems in low-level vision. Typically, those two kinds of methods have their respective merits and drawbacks, e.g., model-based optimization methods are flexible for handling different inverse problems but are usually time-consuming with sophisticated priors for the purpose of good performance; in the meanwhile, discriminative learning methods have fast testing speed but their application range is greatly restricted by the specialized task. Recent works have revealed that, with the aid of variable splitting techniques, denoiser prior can be plugged in as a modular part of model-based optimization methods to solve other inverse problems (e.g., deblurring). Such an integration induces considerable advantage when the denoiser is obtained via discriminative learning. However, the study of integration with fast discriminative denoiser prior is still lacking. To this end, this paper aims to train a set of fast and effective CNN (convolutional neural network) denoisers and integrate them into model-based optimization method to solve other inverse problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the learned set of denoisers can not only achieve promising Gaussian denoising results but also can be used as prior to deliver good performance for various low-level vision applications.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Learning_Deep_CNN_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Kai Zhang, Wangmeng Zuo, Shuhang Gu, Lei Zhang
Learning Deep Context-Aware Features Over Body and Latent Parts for Person Re-Identification	Person Re-identification (ReID) is to identify the same person across different cameras. It is a challenging task due to the large variations in person pose, occlusion, background clutter, etc. How to extract powerful features is a fundamental problem in ReID and is still an open problem today. In this paper, we design a Multi-Scale Context-Aware Network (MSCAN) to learn powerful features over full body and body parts, which can well capture the local context knowledge by stacking multi-scale convolutions in each layer. Moreover, instead of using predefined rigid parts, we propose to learn and localize deformable pedestrian parts using Spatial Transformer Networks (STN) with novel spatial constraints. The learned body parts can release some difficulties, e.g. pose variations and background clutters, in part-based representation. Finally, we integrate the representation learning processes of full body and body parts into a unified framework for person ReID through multi-class person identification tasks. Extensive evaluations on current challenging large-scale person ReID datasets, including the image-based Market1501, CUHK03 and sequence-based MARS datasets, show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Li_Learning_Deep_Context-Aware_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Dangwei Li, Xiaotang Chen, Zhang Zhang, Kaiqi Huang
Learning Deep Match Kernels for Image-Set Classification	Image-set classification has recently generated great popularity due to its widespread applications in computer vision. The great challenges arise from effectively and efficiently measuring the similarity between image sets with high inter-class ambiguity and huge intra-class variability. In this paper, we propose deep match kernels (DMK) to directly measure the similarity between image sets in the match kernel framework. Specifically, we build deep local match kernels between images upon arc-cosine kernels, which can faithfully characterize the similarity between images by mimicking deep neural networks; we introduce anchors to aggregate those deep local match kernels into a global match kernel between image sets, which is learned in a supervised way by kernel alignment and therefore more discriminative. The DMK provides the first match kernel framework for image-set classification, which removes specific assumptions usually required in previous approaches and is computationally more efficient. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets for three diverse image-set classification tasks. The DMK achieves high performance and consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, showing its great effectiveness for image-set classification.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Sun_Learning_Deep_Match_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Haoliang Sun, Xiantong Zhen, Yuanjie Zheng, Gongping Yang, Yilong Yin, Shuo Li
Learning Detailed Face Reconstruction From a Single Image	Reconstructing the detailed geometric structure of a face from a given image is a key to many computer vision and graphics applications, such as motion capture and reenactment. The reconstruction task is challenging as human faces vary extensively when considering expressions, poses, textures, and intrinsic geometries. While many approaches tackle this complexity by using additional data to reconstruct the face of a single subject, extracting facial surface from a single image remains a difficult problem. As a result, single-image based methods can usually provide only a rough estimate of the facial geometry. In contrast, we propose to leverage the power of convolutional neural networks to produce a highly detailed face reconstruction from a single image. For this purpose, we introduce an end-to-end CNN framework which derives the shape in a coarse-to-fine fashion. The proposed architecture is composed of two main blocks, a network that recovers the coarse facial geometry (CoarseNet), followed by a CNN that refines the facial features of that geometry (FineNet). The proposed networks are connected by a novel layer which renders a depth image given a mesh in 3D. Unlike object recognition and detection problems, there are no suitable datasets for training CNNs to perform face geometry reconstruction. Therefore, our training regime begins with a supervised phase, based on synthetic images, followed by an unsupervised phase that uses only unconstrained facial images. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed model is demonstrated by both qualitative and quantitative evaluation tests.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Richardson_Learning_Detailed_Face_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Elad Richardson, Matan Sela, Roy Or-El, Ron Kimmel
Learning Detection With Diverse Proposals	To predict a set of diverse and informative proposals with enriched representations, this paper introduces a differentiable Determinantal Point Process (DPP) layer that is able to augment the object detection architectures. Most modern object detection architectures, such as Faster R-CNN, learn to localize objects by minimizing deviations from the ground truth, but ignore correlation between multiple proposals and object categories. Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) as a widely used proposal pruning scheme ignores label- and instance-level relations between object candidates resulting in multi-labeled detections. In the multi-class case, NMS selects boxes with the largest prediction scores ignoring the semantic relation between categories of potential election. In contrast, our trainable DPP layer, allowing for Learning Detection with Diverse Proposals (LDDP), considers both label-level contextual information and spatial layout relationships between proposals without increasing the number of parameters of the network, and thus improves location and category specifications of final detected bounding boxes substantially during both training and inference schemes. Furthermore, we show that LDDP keeps it superiority over Faster R-CNN even if the number of proposals generated by LDPP is only 30% as many as those for Faster R-CNN.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Azadi_Learning_Detection_With_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Samaneh Azadi, Jiashi Feng, Trevor Darrell
Learning Discriminative and Transformation Covariant Local Feature Detectors	"Robust covariant local feature detectors are important for detecting local features that are (1) discriminative of the image content and (2) can be repeatably detected at consistent locations when the image undergoes diverse transformations. Such detectors are critical for applications such as image search and scene reconstruction. Many learning-based local feature detectors address one of these two problems while overlooking the other. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based method to simultaneously address both issues. Specifically, we extend the covariant constraint proposed by Lenc and Vedaldi by defining the concepts of ""standard patch"" and ""canonical feature"" and leverage these to train a novel robust covariant detector. We show that the introduction of these concepts greatly simplifies the learning stage of the covariant detector, and also makes the detector much more robust. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms previous hand-crafted and learning-based detectors by large margins in terms of repeatability."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Learning_Discriminative_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xu Zhang, Felix X.

Learning Diverse Image Colorization	Colorization is an ambiguous problem, with multiple viable colorizations for a single grey-level image. However, previous methods only produce the single most probable colorization. Our goal is to model the diversity intrinsic to the problem of colorization and produce multiple colorizations that display long-scale spatial co-ordination. We learn a low dimensional embedding of color fields using a variational autoencoder (VAE). We construct loss terms for the VAE decoder that avoid blurry outputs and take into account the uneven distribution of pixel colors. Finally, we build a conditional model for the multi-modal distribution between grey-level image and the color field embeddings. Samples from this conditional model result in diverse colorization. We demonstrate that our method obtains better diverse colorizations than a standard conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) model, as well as a recently proposed conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN).	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Deshpande_Learning_Diverse_Image_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Aditya Deshpande, Jiajun Lu, Mao-Chuang Yeh, Min Jin Chong, David Forsyth
Learning Dynamic GMM for Attention Distribution on Single-Face Videos	The past decade has witnessed the popularity of video conferencing, such as FaceTime and Skype. Hence, it is necessary to predict attention on face videos by saliency detection, as saliency can be used as a guidance of region-of-interest (ROI) for the content-based applications. To this end, this paper proposes a novel approach for saliency detection in single-face videos. Through analysis on our database of 70 single-face videos , we investigate that most attention is attracted by face in videos, and that attention distribution within a face varies with regard to face size and mouth movement. We propose to model visual attention on face region for videos by dynamic Gaussian mixture model (DGMM), the variation of which relies on face size, mouth movement and facial landmarks. Then, we develop a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network in estimating DGMM for saliency detection of single-face videos, so called LSTM-DGMM.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w20/html/Ren_Learning_Dynamic_GMM_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yun Ren, Zulin Wang, Mai Xu, Haoyu Dong, Shengxi Li
Learning Dynamic Guidance for Depth Image Enhancement	The depth images acquired by consumer depth sensors (e.g., Kinect and ToF) usually are of low resolution and insufficient quality. One natural solution is to incorporate with high resolution RGB camera for exploiting their statistical correlation. However, most existing methods are intuitive and limited in characterizing the complex and dynamic dependency between intensity and depth images. To address these limitations, we propose a weighted analysis representation model for guided depth image enhancement, which advances the conventional methods in two aspects: (i) task driven learning and (ii) dynamic guidance. First, we generalize the analysis representation model by including a guided weight function for dependency modeling. And the task-driven learning formulation is introduced to obtain the optimized guidance tailored to specific enhancement task. Second, the depth image is gradually enhanced along with the iterations, and thus the guidance should also be dynamically adjusted to account for the updating of depth image. To this end, stage-wise parameters are learned for dynamic guidance. Experiments on guided depth image upsampling and noisy depth image restoration validate the effectiveness of our method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Gu_Learning_Dynamic_Guidance_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shuhang Gu, Wangmeng Zuo, Shi Guo, Yunjin Chen, Chongyu Chen, Lei Zhang
Learning Features by Watching Objects Move	This paper presents a novel yet intuitive approach to unsupervised feature learning. Inspired by the human visual system, we explore whether low-level motion-based grouping cues can be used to learn an effective visual representation. Specifically, we use unsupervised motion-based segmentation on videos to obtain segments, which we use as 'pseudo ground truth' to train a convolutional network to segment objects from a single frame. Given the extensive evidence that motion plays a key role in the development of the human visual system, we hope that this straightforward approach to unsupervised learning will be more effective than cleverly designed 'pretext' tasks studied in the literature. Indeed, our extensive experiments show that this is the case. When used for transfer learning on object detection, our representation significantly outperforms previous unsupervised approaches across multiple settings, especially when training data for the target task is scarce.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Pathak_Learning_Features_by_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Deepak Pathak, Ross Girshick, Piotr Dollar, Trevor Darrell, Bharath Hariharan
Learning From Noisy Large-Scale Datasets With Minimal Supervision	We present an approach to effectively use millions of images with noisy annotations in conjunction with a small subset of cleanly-annotated images to learn powerful image representations. One common approach to combine clean and noisy data is to first pre-train a network using the large noisy dataset and then fine-tune with the clean dataset. We show this approach does not fully leverage the information contained in the clean set. Thus, we demonstrate how to use the clean annotations to reduce the noise in the large dataset before fine-tuning the network using both the clean set and the full set with reduced noise. The approach comprises a multi-task network that jointly learns to clean noisy annotations and to accurately classify images. We evaluate our approach on the recently released Open Images dataset, containing 9 million images, multiple annotations per image and over 6000 unique classes. For the small clean set of annotations we use a quarter of the validation set with 40k images. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach clearly outperforms direct fine-tuning across all major categories of classes in the Open Image dataset. Further, our approach is particularly effective for a large number of classes with wide range of noise in annotations (20-80% false positive annotations).	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Veit_Learning_From_Noisy_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Andreas Veit, Neil Alldrin, Gal Chechik, Ivan Krasin, Abhinav Gupta, Serge Belongie
Learning From Simulated and Unsupervised Images Through Adversarial Training	With recent progress in graphics, it has become more tractable to train models on synthetic images, potentially avoiding the need for expensive annotations. However, learning from synthetic images may not achieve the desired performance due to a gap between synthetic and real image distributions. To reduce this gap, we propose Simulated+Unsupervised (S+U) learning, where the task is to learn a model to improve the realism of a simulator's output using unlabeled real data, while preserving the annotation information from the simulator. We develop a method for S+U learning that uses an adversarial network similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), but with synthetic images as inputs instead of random vectors. We make several key modifications to the standard GAN algorithm to preserve annotations, avoid artifacts, and stabilize training: (i) a 'self-regularization' term, (ii) a local adversarial loss, and (iii) updating the discriminator using a history of refined images. We show that this enables generation of highly realistic images, which we demonstrate both qualitatively and with a user study. We quantitatively evaluate the generated images by training models for gaze estimation and hand pose estimation. We show a significant improvement over using synthetic images, and achieve state-of-the-art results on the MPIIGaze dataset without any labeled real data.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Shrivastava_Learning_From_Simulated_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ashish Shrivastava, Tomas Pfister, Oncel Tuzel, Joshua Susskind, Wenda Wang, Russell Webb
Learning From Synthetic Humans	Estimating human pose, shape, and motion from images and video are fundamental challenges with many applications. Recent advances in 2D human pose estimation use large amounts of manually-labeled training data for learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Such data is time consuming to acquire and difficult to extend. Moreover, manual labeling of 3D pose, depth and motion is impractical. In this work we present SURREAL: a new large-scale dataset with synthetically-generated but realistic images of people rendered from 3D sequences of human motion capture data. We generate more than 6 million frames together with ground truth pose, depth maps, and segmentation masks. We show that CNNs trained on our synthetic dataset allow for accurate human depth estimation and human part segmentation in real RGB images. Our results and the new datast open up new possibilities for advancing person analysis using chap and large-scale synthetic data.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Varol_Learning_From_Synthetic_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Gul Varol, Javier Romero, Xavier Martin, Naureen Mahmood, Michael J.

Learning Fully Convolutional Networks for Iterative Non-Blind Deconvolution	In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional network for iterative non-blind deconvolution. We decompose the non-blind deconvolution problem into image denoising and image deconvolution. We train a FCNN to remove noise in the gradient domain and use the learned gradients to guide the image deconvolution step. In contrast to the existing deep neural network based methods, we iteratively deconvolve the blurred images in a multi-stage framework. The proposed method is able to learn an adaptive image prior, which keeps both local (details) and global (structures) information. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of quality and speed.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Learning_Fully_Convolutional_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jiawei Zhang, Jinshan Pan, Wei-Sheng Lai, Rynson W.

Learning Latent Temporal Connectionism of Deep Residual Visual Abstractions for Identifying Surgical Tools in Laparoscopy Procedures	Surgical workflow in minimally invasive interventions like laparoscopy can be modeled with the aid of tool usage information. The video recording during the surgery primarily for viewing the surgical site using endoscope can be leveraged for this purpose without the need for additional sensors or instruments. We propose a method which learns to detect the tool presence in laparoscopy videos by leveraging the temporal information of the systematically executed surgical procedures and higher abstractions of the spatial visual features extracted from the surgical video. We propose a framework consisting of using Convolutional Neural Networks for extracting the visual features and Long Short-Term Memory network to encode the temporal information. The proposed framework has been experimentally verified using a publicly available dataset consisting of 10 training and 5 testing annotated videos with an average accuracy of 88.75% in detection of tool presence.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w37/html/Mishra_Learning_Latent_Temporal_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Kaustuv Mishra, Rachana Sathish, Debdoot Sheet
Learning Motion Patterns in Videos	"The problem of determining whether an object is in motion, irrespective of camera motion, is far from being solved. We address this challenging task by learning motion patterns in videos. The core of our approach is a fully convolutional network, which is learned entirely from synthetic video sequences, and their ground-truth optical flow and motion segmentation. This encoder-decoder style architecture first learns a coarse representation of the optical flow field features, and then refines it iteratively to produce motion labels at the original high-resolution. We further improve this labeling with an objectness map and a conditional random field, to account for errors in optical flow, and also to focus on moving ""things"" rather than ""stuff"". The output label of each pixel denotes whether it has undergone independent motion, i.e., irrespective of camera motion. We demonstrate the benefits of this learning framework on the moving object segmentation task, where the goal is to segment all objects in motion. Our approach outperforms the top method on the recently released DAVIS benchmark dataset, comprising real-world sequences, by 5.6%. We also evaluate on the Berkeley motion segmentation database, achieving state-of-the-art results."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tokmakov_Learning_Motion_Patterns_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Pavel Tokmakov, Karteek Alahari, Cordelia Schmid
Learning Multifunctional Binary Codes for Both Category and Attribute Oriented Retrieval Tasks	In this paper we propose a unified framework to address multiple realistic image retrieval tasks concerning both category and attributes. Considering the scale of modern datasets, hashing is favorable for its low complexity. However, most existing hashing methods are designed to preserve one single kind of similarity, thus incapable of dealing with the different tasks simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new hashing method, named Dual Purpose Hashing (DPH), which jointly preserves the category and attribute similarities by exploiting the convolutional networks (CNN) to hierarchically capture the correlations between category and attributes. Since images with both category and attribute labels are scarce, our method is designed to take the abundant partially labelled images on the Internet as training inputs. With such a framework, the binary codes of new-coming images can be readily obtained by quantizing the network outputs of a binary-like layer, and the attributes can be recovered from the codes easily. Experiments on two large-scale datasets show that our dual purpose hash codes can achieve comparable or even better performance than those state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for each individual retrieval task, while being more compact than the compared methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Liu_Learning_Multifunctional_Binary_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Haomiao Liu, Ruiping Wang, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen
Learning Non-Lambertian Object Intrinsics Across ShapeNet Categories	We focus on the non-Lambertian object-level intrinsic problem of recovering diffuse albedo, shading, and specular highlights from a single image of an object. Based on existing 3D models in the ShapeNet database, a large-scale object intrinsics database is rendered with HDR environment maps. Millions of synthetic images of objects and their corresponding albedo, shading, and specular ground-truth images are used to train an encoder-decoder CNN, which can decompose an image into the product of albedo and shading components along with an additive specular component. Our CNN delivers accurate and sharp results in this classical inverse problem of computer vision. Evaluated on our realistically synthetic dataset, our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin. We train and test our CNN across different object categories. Perhaps surprising especially from the CNN classification perspective, our intrinsics CNN generalizes very well across categories. Our analysis shows that feature learning at the encoder stage is more crucial for developing a universal representation across categories. We apply our model to real images and videos from Internet, and observe robust and realistic intrinsics results. Quality non-Lambertian intrinsics could open up many interesting applications such as realistic product search based on material properties and image-based albedo / specular editing.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Shi_Learning_Non-Lambertian_Object_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jian Shi, Yue Dong, Hao Su, Stella X.

Learning Non-Maximum Suppression	Object detectors have hugely profited from moving towards an end-to-end learning paradigm: proposals, fea tures, and the classifier becoming one neural network improved results two-fold on general object detection. One indispensable component is non-maximum suppression (NMS), a post-processing algorithm responsible for merging all detections that belong to the same object. The de facto standard NMS algorithm is still fully hand-crafted, suspiciously simple, and -- being based on greedy clustering with a fixed distance threshold -- forces a trade-off between recall and precision. We propose a new network architecture designed to perform NMS, using only boxes and their score. We report experiments for person detection on PETS and for general object categories on the COCO dataset. Our approach shows promise providing improved localization and occlusion handling.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Hosang_Learning_Non-Maximum_Suppression_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jan Hosang, Rodrigo Benenson, Bernt Schiele
Learning Object Interactions and Descriptions for Semantic Image Segmentation	Recent advanced deep convolutional networks (CNNs) achieved great successes in many computer vision tasks, because of their compelling learning complexity and the presences of large-scale labeled data. However, as obtaining per-pixel annotations is expensive, performances of CNNs in semantic image segmentation are not fully exploited. This work significantly increases segmentation accuracy of CNNs by learning from an Image Descriptions in the Wild (IDW) dataset. Unlike previous image captioning datasets, where captions were manually and densely annotated, images and their descriptions in IDW are automatically downloaded from Internet without any manual cleaning and refinement. An IDW-CNN is proposed to jointly train IDW and existing image segmentation dataset such as Pascal VOC 2012 (VOC). It has two appealing properties. First, knowledge from different datasets can be fully explored and transferred from each other to improve performance. Second, segmentation accuracy in VOC can be constantly increased when selecting more data from IDW. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of IDW-CNN, which outperforms existing best-performing system by 12% on VOC12 test set.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_Learning_Object_Interactions_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Guangrun Wang, Ping Luo, Liang Lin, Xiaogang Wang
Learning Random-Walk Label Propagation for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation	Large-scale training for semantic segmentation is challenging due to the expense of obtaining training data for this task relative to other vision tasks. We propose a novel training approach to address this difficulty. Given cheaply-obtained sparse image labelings, we propagate the sparse labels to produce guessed dense labelings. A standard CNN-based segmentation network is trained to mimic these labelings. The label-propagation process is defined via random-walk hitting probabilities, which leads to a differentiable parameterization with uncertainty estimates that are incorporated into our loss. We show that by learning the label-propagator jointly with the segmentation predictor, we are able to effectively learn semantic edges given no direct edge supervision. Experiments also show that training a segmentation network in this way outperforms the naive approach.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Vernaza_Learning_Random-Walk_Label_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Paul Vernaza, Manmohan Chandraker
Learning Residual Images for Face Attribute Manipulation	Face attributes are interesting due to their detailed description of human faces. Unlike prior researches working on attribute prediction, we address an inverse and more challenging problem called face attribute manipulation which aims at modifying a face image according to a given attribute value. Instead of manipulating the whole image, we propose to learn the corresponding residual image defined as the difference between images before and after the manipulation. In this way, the manipulation can be operated efficiently with modest pixel modification. The framework of our approach is based on the Generative Adversarial Network. It consists of two image transformation networks and a discriminative network. The transformation networks are responsible for the attribute manipulation and its dual operation and the discriminative network is used to distinguish the generated images from real images. We also apply dual learning to allow transformation networks to learn from each other. Experiments show that residual images can be effectively learned and used for attribute manipulations. The generated images remain most of the details in attribute-irrelevant areas.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Shen_Learning_Residual_Images_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Wei Shen, Rujie Liu
Learning Robot Activities From First-Person Human Videos Using Convolutional Future Regression	We design a new approach that allows robot learning of new activities from unlabeled human example videos.

We present a new fully convolutional neural network architecture to regress the intermediate scene representation corresponding to the future frame, thereby enabling explicit forecasting of future hand locations given the current frame.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w5/html/Lee_Learning_Robot_Activities_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jangwon Lee, Michael S.

We demonstrate that using our method allows predicting shape representations which can be leveraged for obtaining a consistent parsing across the instances of a shape collection and constructing an interpretable shape similarity measure.

Learning Shape Trends: Parameter Estimation in Diffusions on Shape Manifolds	Learning the dynamics of shape is at the heart of many computer vision problems: object tracking, change detection, longitudinal shape analysis, trajectory classification, etc. In this work we address the problem of statistical inference of diffusion processes of shapes. We formulate a general It\^o diffusion on the manifold of deformable landmarks and propose several drift models for the evolution of shapes. We derive explicit formulas for the maximum likelihood estimators of the unknown parameters in these models, and demonstrate their convergence properties on simulated sequences when true parameters are known. We further discuss how these models can be extended to a more general non-parametric approach to shape estimation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w7/html/Staneva_Learning_Shape_Trends_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Valentina Staneva, Laurent Younes
Learning Spatial Regularization With Image-Level Supervisions for Multi-Label Image Classification	Multi-label image classification is a fundamental but challenging task in computer vision. Great progress has been achieved by exploiting semantic relations between labels in recent years. However, conventional approaches are unable to model the underlying spatial relations between labels in multi-label images, because spatial annotations of the labels are generally not provided. In this paper, we propose a unified deep neural network that exploits both semantic and spatial relations between labels with only image-level supervisions. Given a multi-label image, our proposed Spatial Regularization Network (SRN) generates attention maps for all labels and captures the underlying relations between them via learnable convolutions. By aggregating the regularized classification results with original results by a ResNet-101 network, the classification performance can be consistently improved. The whole deep neural network is trained end-to-end with only image-level annotations, thus requires no additional efforts on image annotations. Extensive evaluations on 3 public datasets with different types of labels show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts and has strong generalization capability. Analysis of the learned SRN model demonstrates that it can effectively capture both semantic and spatial relations of labels for improving classification performance.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhu_Learning_Spatial_Regularization_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Feng Zhu, Hongsheng Li, Wanli Ouyang, Nenghai Yu, Xiaogang Wang
Learning Spatiotemporal Features for Infrared Action Recognition With 3D Convolutional Neural Networks	While the action recognition task on videos collected from visible spectrum imaging has received much attention, action recognition in infrared (IR) videos is significantly less explored. Our objective is to exploit imaging data in this modality for the action recognition task. In this work, we propose a novel two-stream 3D convolutional neural network architecture by introducing the discriminative code layer and the corresponding discriminative code loss function. The proposed network processes IR images and the IR-based optical flow field sequences. We pretrain the 3D CNN model on the visible spectrum Sports-1M action dataset and finetune it on the Infrared Action Recognition (InfAR) dataset. We conduct an elaborate analysis of different fusion schemes (weighted average, single and double-layer neural nets) applied to different 3D CNN outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art average precision performances on the InfAR dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w3/html/Jiang_Learning_Spatiotemporal_Features_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhuolin Jiang, Viktor Rozgic, Sancar Adali
Learning Video Object Segmentation From Static Images	Inspired by recent advances of deep learning in instance segmentation and object tracking, we introduce the concept of convnet-based guidance applied to video object segmentation. Our model proceeds on a per-frame basis, guided by the output of the previous frame towards the object of interest in the next frame. We demonstrate that highly accurate object segmentation in videos can be enabled by using a convolutional neural network (convnet) trained with static images only. The key component of our approach is a combination of offline and online learning strategies, where the former produces a refined mask from the previous' frame estimate and the latter allows to capture the appearance of the specific object instance. Our method can handle different types of input annotations such as bounding boxes and segments while leveraging an arbitrary amount of annotated frames. Therefore our system is suitable for diverse applications with different requirements in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In our extensive evaluation, we obtain competitive results on three different datasets, independently from the type of input annotation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Perazzi_Learning_Video_Object_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Federico Perazzi, Anna Khoreva, Rodrigo Benenson, Bernt Schiele, Alexander Sorkine-Hornung
Learning a Deep Embedding Model for Zero-Shot Learning	Zero-shot learning (ZSL) models rely on learning a joint embedding space where both textual/semantic description of object classes and visual representation of object images can be projected to for nearest neighbour search. Despite the success of deep neural networks that learn an end-to-end model between text and images in other vision problems such as image captioning, very few deep ZSL model exists and they show little advantage over ZSL models that utilise deep feature representations but do not learn an end-to-end embedding. In this paper we argue that the key to make deep ZSL models succeed is to choose the right embedding space. Instead of embedding into a semantic space or an intermediate space, we propose to use the visual space as the embedding space. This is because that in this space, the subsequent nearest neighbour search would suffer much less from the hubness problem and thus become more effective. This model design also provides a natural mechanism for multiple semantic modalities (e.g., attributes and sentence descriptions) to be fused and optimised jointly in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that our model significantly outperforms the existing models.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Learning_a_Deep_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Li Zhang, Tao Xiang, Shaogang Gong
Learning an Invariant Hilbert Space for Domain Adaptation	This paper introduces a learning scheme to construct a Hilbert space (i.e., a vector space along its inner product) to address both unsupervised and semi-supervised domain adaptation problems. This is achieved by learning projections from each domain to a latent space along the Mahalanobis metric of the latent space to simultaneously minimizing a notion of domain variance while maximizing a measure of discriminatory power. In particular, we make use of the Riemannian optimization techniques to match statistical properties (e.g., first and second order statistics) between samples projected into the latent space from different domains. Upon availability of class labels, we further deem samples sharing the same label to form more compact clusters while pulling away samples coming from different classes.We extensively evaluate and contrast our proposal against state-of-the-art methods for the task of visual domain adaptation using both handcrafted and deep-net features. Our experiments show that even with a simple nearest neighbor classifier, the proposed method can outperform several state-of-the-art methods benefitting from more involved classification schemes.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Herath_Learning_an_Invariant_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Samitha Herath, Mehrtash Harandi, Fatih Porikli
Learning and Refining of Privileged Information-Based RNNs for Action Recognition From Depth Sequences	Existing RNN-based approaches for action recognition from depth sequences require either skeleton joints or hand-crafted depth features as inputs. An end-to-end manner, mapping from raw depth maps to action classes, is non-trivial to design due to the fact that: 1) single channel map lacks texture thus weakens the discriminative power; 2) relatively small set of depth training data. To address these challenges, we propose to learn an RNN driven by privileged information (PI) in three-steps: An encoder is pre-trained to learn a joint embedding of depth appearance and PI (i.e. skeleton joints). The learned embedding layers are then tuned in the learning step, aiming to optimize the network by exploiting PI in a form of multi-task loss. However, exploiting PI as a secondary task provides little help to improve the performance of a primary task (i.e. classification) due to the gap between them. Finally, a bridging matrix is defined to connect two tasks by discovering latent PI in the refining step. Our PI-based classification loss maintains a consistency between latent PI and predicted distribution. The latent PI and network are iteratively estimated and updated in an expectation-maximization procedure. The proposed learning process provides greater discriminative power to model subtle depth difference, while helping avoid overfitting the scarcer training data. Our experiments show significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on three public benchmark datasets and our newly collected Blanket dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Shi_Learning_and_Refining_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhiyuan Shi, Tae-Kyun Kim
Learning by Association -- A Versatile Semi-Supervised Training Method for Neural Networks	"In many real-world scenarios, labeled data for a specific machine learning task is costly to obtain. Semi-supervised training methods make use of abundantly available unlabeled data and a smaller number of labeled examples. We propose a new framework for semi-supervised training of deep neural networks inspired by learning in humans. ""Associations"" are made from embeddings of labeled samples to those of unlabeled ones and back. The optimization schedule encourages correct association cycles that end up at the same class from which the association was started and penalizes wrong associations ending at a different class. The implementation is easy to use and can be added to any existing end-to-end training setup. We demonstrate the capabilities of learning by association on several data sets and show that it can improve performance on classification tasks tremendously by making use of additionally available unlabeled data. In particular, for cases with few labeled data, our training scheme outperforms the current state of the art on SVHN."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Haeusser_Learning_by_Association_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Philip Haeusser, Alexander Mordvintsev, Daniel Cremers
Learning the Multilinear Structure of Visual Data	Statistical decomposition methods are of paramount importance in discovering the modes of variations of visual data. Probably the most prominent linear decomposition method is the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which discovers a single mode of variation in the data. However, in practice, visual data exhibit several modes of variations. For instance, the appearance of faces varies in identity, expression, pose etc. To extract these modes of variations from visual data, several supervised methods, such as the TensorFaces, that rely on multilinear (tensor) decomposition (e.g., Higher Order SVD) have been developed. The main drawbacks of such methods is that they require both labels regarding the modes of variations and the same number of samples under all modes of variations (e.g., the same face under different expressions, poses etc.). Therefore, their applicability is limited to well-organised data, usually captured in well-controlled conditions. In this paper, we propose the first general multilinear method, to the best of our knowledge, that discovers the multilinear structure of visual data in unsupervised setting. That is, without the presence of labels. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method in two applications, namely Shape from Shading (SfS) and expression transfer.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_Learning_the_Multilinear_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mengjiao Wang, Yannis Panagakis, Patrick Snape, Stefanos Zafeiriou
Learning to Align Semantic Segmentation and 2.5D Maps for Geolocalization	We present an efficient method for geolocalization in urban environments starting from a coarse estimate of the location provided by a GPS and using a simple untextured 2.5D model of the surrounding buildings. Our key contribution is a novel efficient and robust method to optimize the pose: We train a Deep Network to predict the best direction to improve a pose estimate, given a semantic segmentation of the input image and a rendering of the buildings from this estimate. We then iteratively apply this CNN until converging to a good pose. This approach avoids the use of reference images of the surroundings, which are difficult to acquire and match, while 2.5D models are broadly available. We can therefore apply it to places unseen during training.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Armagan_Learning_to_Align_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Anil Armagan, Martin Hirzer, Peter M.

Learning to Detect Salient Objects With Image-Level Supervision	Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have substantially improved the state-of-the-art in salient object detection. However, training DNNs requires costly pixel-level annotations. In this paper, we leverage the observation that image-level tags provide important cues of foreground salient objects, and develop a weakly supervised learning method for saliency detection using image-level tags only. The Foreground Inference Network (FIN) is introduced for this challenging task. In the first stage of our training method, FIN is jointly trained with a fully convolutional network (FCN) for image-level tag prediction. A global smooth pooling layer is proposed, enabling FCN to assign object category tags to corresponding object regions, while FIN is capable of capturing all potential foreground regions with the predicted saliency maps. In the second stage, FIN is fine-tuned with its predicted saliency maps as ground truth. For refinement of ground truth, an iterative Conditional Random Field is developed to enforce spatial label consistency and further boost performance. Our method alleviates annotation efforts and allows the usage of existing large scale training sets with image-level tags. Our model runs at 60 FPS, outperforms unsupervised ones with a large margin, and achieves comparable or even superior performance than fully supervised counterparts.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_Learning_to_Detect_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Lijun Wang, Huchuan Lu, Yifan Wang, Mengyang Feng, Dong Wang, Baocai Yin, Xiang Ruan
Learning to Extract Semantic Structure From Documents Using Multimodal Fully Convolutional Neural Networks	We present an end-to-end, multimodal, fully convolutional network for extracting semantic structures from document images. We consider document semantic structure extraction as a pixel-wise segmentation task, and propose a unified model that classifies pixels based not only on their visual appearance, as in the traditional page segmentation task, but also on the content of underlying text. Moreover, we propose an efficient synthetic document generation process that we use to generate pretraining data for our network. Once the network is trained on a large set of synthetic documents, we fine-tune the network on unlabeled real documents using a semi-supervised approach. We systematically study the optimum network architecture and show that both our multimodal approach and the synthetic data pretraining significantly boost the performance.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yang_Learning_to_Extract_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xiao Yang, Ersin Yumer, Paul Asente, Mike Kraley, Daniel Kifer, C.

Learning to Learn From Noisy Web Videos	"Understanding the simultaneously very diverse and intricately fine-grained set of possible human actions is a critical open problem in computer vision. Manually labeling training videos is feasible for some action classes but doesn't scale to the full long-tailed distribution of actions. A promising way to address this is to leverage noisy data from web queries to learn new actions, using semi-supervised or ""webly-supervised"" approaches. However, these methods typically do not learn domain-specific knowledge, or rely on iterative hand-tuned data labeling policies. In this work, we instead propose a reinforcement learning-based formulation for selecting the right examples for training a classifier from noisy web search results. Our method uses Q-learning to learn a data labeling policy on a small labeled training dataset, and then uses this to automatically label noisy web data for new visual concepts. Experiments on the challenging Sports-1M action recognition benchmark as well as on additional fine-grained and newly emerging action classes demonstrate that our method is able to learn good labeling policies for noisy data and use this to learn accurate visual concept classifiers."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yeung_Learning_to_Learn_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Serena Yeung, Vignesh Ramanathan, Olga Russakovsky, Liyue Shen, Greg Mori, Li Fei-Fei
Learning to Predict Stereo Reliability Enforcing Local Consistency of Confidence Maps	Confidence measures estimate unreliable disparity assignments performed by a stereo matching algorithm and, as recently proved, can be used for several purposes. This paper aims at increasing, by means of a deep network, the effectiveness of state-of-the-art confidence measures exploiting the local consistency assumption. We exhaustively evaluated our proposal on 23 confidence measures, including 5 top-performing ones based on random-forests and CNNs, training our networks with two popular stereo algorithms and a small subset (25 out of 194 frames) of the KITTI 2012 dataset. Experimental results show that our approach dramatically increases the effectiveness of all the 23 confidence measures on the remaining frames. Moreover, without re-training, we report a further cross-evaluation on KITTI 2015 and Middlebury 2014 confirming that our proposal provides remarkable improvements for each confidence measure even when dealing with significantly different input data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to move beyond conventional pixel-wise confidence estimation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Poggi_Learning_to_Predict_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Matteo Poggi, Stefano Mattoccia
Learning to Rank Retargeted Images	Image retargeting techniques that adjust images into different sizes have attracted much attention recently. Objective quality assessment (OQA) of image retargeting results is often desired to automatically select the best results. Existing OQA methods output an absolute score for each retargeted image and use these scores to compare different results. Observing that it is challenging even for human subjects to give consistent scores for retargeting results of different source images, in this paper we propose a learning-based OQA method that predicts the ranking of a set of retargeted images with the same source image. We show that this more manageable task helps achieve more consistent prediction to human preference and is sufficient for most application scenarios. To compute the ranking, we propose a simple yet efficient machine learning framework that uses a General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) to model a combination of seven elaborate OQA metrics. We then propose a simple scheme to transform the relative scores output from GRNN into a global ranking. We train our GRNN model using human preference data collected in the elaborate RetargetMe benchmark and evaluate our method based on the subjective study in RetargetMe. Moreover, we introduce a further subjective benchmark to evaluate the generalizability of different OQA methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms eight representative OQA methods in ranking prediction and has better generalizability to different datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chen_Learning_to_Rank_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yang Chen, Yong-Jin Liu, Yu-Kun Lai
Learning to Score Olympic Events	"Estimating action quality, the process of assigning a ""score"" to the execution of an action, is crucial in areas such as sports and health care. Unlike action recognition, which has millions of examples to learn from, the action quality datasets that are currently available are small -typically comprised of only a few hundred samples. This work presents three frameworks for evaluating Olympic sports which utilize spatiotemporal features learned using 3D convolutional neural networks (C3D) and perform score regression with i) SVR ii) LSTM and iii) LSTM followed by SVR. An efficient training mechanism for the limited data scenarios is presented for clip-based training with LSTM. The proposed systems show significant improvement over existing quality assessment approaches on the task of predicting scores of diving, vault, figure skating. SVR-based frameworks yield better results, LSTM-based frameworks are more natural for describing an action and can be used for improvement feedback."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w2/html/Parmar_Learning_to_Score_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Paritosh Parmar, Brendan Tran Morris
Level Playing Field for Million Scale Face Recognition	Face recognition has the perception of a solved problem, however when tested at the million-scale exhibits dramatic variation in accuracies across the different algorithms [??]. Are the algorithms very different? Is access to good/big training data their secret weapon? Where should face recognition improve? To address those questions, we created a benchmark, MF2, that requires all algorithms to be trained on same data, and tested at the million scale. MF2 is a public large-scale set with 672K identities and 4.7M photos created with the goal to level playing field for large scale face recognition. We contrast our results with findings from the other two large-scale benchmarks MegaFace Challenge and MS-Celebs-1M where groups were allowed to train on any private/public/big/small set. Some key discoveries: 1) algorithms, trained on MF2, were able to achieve state of the art and comparable results to algorithms trained on massive private sets, 2) some outperformed themselves once trained on MF2, 3) invariance to aging suffers from low accuracies as in MegaFace, identifying the need for larger age variations possibly within identities or adjustment of algorithms in future testing.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Nech_Level_Playing_Field_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Aaron Nech, Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman
Leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning for Reaching Robotic Tasks	This work leverages Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to make robotic control immune to changes in the robot manipulator or the environment and to perform reaching, collision avoidance and grasping without explicit, prior and fine knowledge of the human arm structure and kinematics, without careful hand-eye calibration, solely based on visual/retinal input, and in ways that are robust to environmental changes. We learn a manipulation policy which we show takes the first steps toward generalizing to changes in the environment and can scale and adapt to new manipulators. Experiments are aimed at a) comparing different DCNN network architectures b) assessing the reward prediction for two radically different manipulators and c) performing a sensitivity analysis comparing a classical visual servoing formulation of the reaching task with the proposed DRL method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w5/html/Katyal_Leveraging_Deep_Reinforcement_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Kapil Katyal, I-Jeng Wang, Philippe Burlina
Leveraging Intra and Inter-Dataset Variations for Robust Face Alignment	Face alignment is a critical topic in the computer vision community. Numerous efforts have been made and various benchmark datasets have been released in recent decades. However, two significant issues remain in recent datasets, e.g., Intra-Dataset Variation and Inter-Dataset Variation. Inter-Dataset Variation refers to bias on expression, head pose, etc. inside one certain dataset, while Intra-Dataset Variation refers to different bias across different datasets. To address the mentioned problems, we proposed a novel Deep Variation Leveraging Network (DVLN), which consists of two strong coupling sub-networks, e.g., Dataset-Across Network (DA-Net) and Candidate-Decision Network (CD-Net). Extensive evaluations show that our approach demonstrates real-time performance and dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging 300-W dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w33/html/Wu_Leveraging_Intra_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Wenyan Wu, Shuo Yang
Lifting From the Deep: Convolutional 3D Pose Estimation From a Single Image	We propose a unified formulation for the problem of 3D human pose estimation from a single raw RGB image that reasons jointly about 2D joint estimation and 3D pose reconstruction to improve both tasks. We take an integrated approach that fuses probabilistic knowledge of 3D human pose with a multi-stage CNN architecture and uses the knowledge of plausible 3D landmark locations to refine the search for better 2D locations. The entire process is trained end-to-end, is extremely efficient and obtains state-of-the-art results on Human3.6M outperforming previous approaches both on 2D and 3D errors.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tome_Lifting_From_the_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Denis Tome, Chris Russell, Lourdes Agapito
Light Field Blind Motion Deblurring	We study the problem of deblurring light fields of general 3D scenes captured under 3D camera motion and present both theoretical and practical contributions. By analyzing the motion-blurred light field in the primal and Fourier domains, we develop intuition into the effects of camera motion on the light field, show the advantages of capturing a 4D light field instead of a conventional 2D image for motion deblurring, and derive simple analytical methods of motion deblurring in certain cases. We then present an algorithm to blindly deblur light fields of general scenes without any estimation of scene geometry, and demonstrate that we can recover both the sharp light field and the 3D camera motion path of real and synthetically-blurred light fields.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Srinivasan_Light_Field_Blind_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Pratul P.

Theproposedmethodutilizes local photo consistency, which is one of characteristics of the light field convergency.

Light Field Reconstruction Using Deep Convolutional Network on EPI	In this paper, we take advantage of the clear texture structure of the epipolar plane image (EPI) in the light field data and model the problem of light field reconstruction from a sparse set of views as a CNN-based angular detail restoration on EPI. We indicate that one of the main challenges in sparsely sampled light field reconstruction is the information asymmetry between the spatial and angular domain, where the detail portion in the angular domain is damaged by undersampling. To balance the spatial and angular information, the spatial high frequency components of an EPI is removed using EPI blur, before feeding to the network. Finally, a non-blind deblur operation is used to recover the spatial detail suppressed by the EPI blur. We evaluate our approach on several datasets including synthetic scenes, real-world scenes and challenging microscope light field data. We demonstrate the high performance and robustness of the proposed framework compared with the state-of-the-arts algorithms. We also show a further application for depth enhancement by using the reconstructed light field.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wu_Light_Field_Reconstruction_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Gaochang Wu, Mandan Zhao, Liangyong Wang, Qionghai Dai, Tianyou Chai, Yebin Liu
Linearizing the Plenoptic Space	The plenoptic function, also known as the light field or the lumigraph, contains the information about the radiance of all optical rays that go through all points in space in a scene. Since no camera can capture all this information, one of the main challenges in plenoptic imaging is light field reconstruction, which consists in interpolating the ray samples captured by the cameras to create a dense light field. Most existing methods perform this task by first attempting some kind of 3D reconstruction of the visible scene. Our method, in contrast, works by modeling the scene as a set of visual points, which describe how each point moves in the image when a camera moves. We compute visual point models of various degrees of complexity, and show that high-dimensional models are able to replicate complex optical effects such as reflection or refraction, and a model selection method can differentiate quasi-Lambertian from non-Lambertian areas in the scene.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w27/html/Nieto_Linearizing_the_Plenoptic_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Gregoire Nieto, Frederic Devernay, James Crowley
"Link the Head to the ""Beak"": Zero Shot Learning From Noisy Text Description at Part Precision"	"In this paper, we study learning visual classifiers from unstructured text description at part precision with no training images. We show that visual text terms can be encouraged to attend to its relevant parts, while image connections to non-visual text terms vanishes without any supervision. This learning process enables terms like ""peak"" to be linked to parts like only head for instance , while non-visual terms like ""migrate"" not to affect classifier prediction without part-text annotation. Images are encoded by a part-based CNN that detect bird parts and learn part-specific learning representation. Part-based visual classifiers are predicted from text descriptions of unseen visual classifiers to facilitate classification without training images (also known as zero-shot recognition ). We performed our experiments on CUB200 dataset and improves the zero-shot recognition results from 34.2% to 44.0%. We also created a large scale benchmark on 404 North American Bird Images with text descriptions, where we also showed that our method outperforming existing methods."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Elhoseiny_Link_the_Head_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mohamed Elhoseiny, Yizhe Zhu, Han Zhang, Ahmed Elgammal
Linking Image and Text With 2-Way Nets	Linking two data sources is a basic building block in numerous computer vision problems. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) achieves this by utilizing a linear optimizer in order to maximize the correlation between the two views. Recent work makes use of non-linear models, including deep learning techniques, that optimize the CCA loss in some feature space. In this paper, we introduce a novel, bi-directional neural network architecture for the task of matching vectors from two data sources. Our approach employs two tied neural network channels that project the two views into a common, maximally correlated space using the Euclidean loss. We show a direct link between the correlation-based loss and Euclidean loss, enabling the use of Euclidean loss for correlation maximization. To overcome common Euclidean regression optimization problems, we modify well-known techniques to our problem, including batch normalization and dropout. We show state of the art results on a number of computer vision matching tasks including MNIST image matching and sentence-image matching on the Flickr8k, Flickr30k and COCO datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Eisenschtat_Linking_Image_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Aviv Eisenschtat, Lior Wolf
Lip Reading Sentences in the Wild	The goal of this work is to recognise phrases and sentences being spoken by a talking face, with or without the audio. Unlike previous works that have focussed on recognising a limited number of words or phrases, we tackle lip reading as an open-world problem - unconstrained natural language sentences, and in the wild videos. Our key contributions are: (1) a 'Watch, Listen, Attend and Spell' (WLAS) network that learns to transcribe videos of mouth motion to characters; (2) a curriculum learning strategy to accelerate training and to reduce overfitting; (3) a 'Lip Reading Sentences' (LRS) dataset for visual speech recognition, consisting of over 100,000 natural sentences from British television. The WLAS model trained on the LRS dataset surpasses the performance of all previous work on standard lip reading benchmark datasets, often by a significant margin. This lip reading performance beats a professional lip reader on videos from BBC television, and we also demonstrate that if audio is available, then visual information helps to improve speech recognition performance.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chung_Lip_Reading_Sentences_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Joon Son Chung, Andrew Senior, Oriol Vinyals, Andrew Zisserman
Local Binary Convolutional Neural Networks	We propose local binary convolution (LBC), an efficient alternative to convolutional layers in standard convolutional neural networks (CNN). The design principles of LBC are motivated by local binary patterns (LBP). The LBC layer comprises of a set of fixed sparse pre-defined binary convolutional filters that are not updated during the training process, a non-linear activation function and a set of learnable linear weights. The linear weights combine the activated filter responses to approximate the corresponding activated filter responses of a standard convolutional layer. The LBC layer affords significant parameter savings, 9x to 169x in the number of learnable parameters compared to a standard convolutional layer. Furthermore, the sparse and binary nature of the weights also results in up to 9x to 169x savings in model size compared to a standard convolutional layer. We demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that our local binary convolution layer is a good approximation of a standard convolutional layer. Empirically, CNNs with LBC layers, called local binary convolutional neural networks (LBCNN), achieves performance parity with regular CNNs on a range of visual datasets (MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet) while enjoying significant computational savings.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Juefei-Xu_Local_Binary_Convolutional_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Felix Juefei-Xu, Vishnu Naresh Boddeti, Marios Savvides
Locality-Sensitive Deconvolution Networks With Gated Fusion for RGB-D Indoor Semantic Segmentation	This paper focuses on indoor semantic segmentation using RGB-D data. Although the commonly used deconvolution networks (DeconvNet) have achieved impressive results on this task, we find there is still room for improvements in two aspects. One is about the boundary segmentation. DeconvNet aggregates large context to predict the label of each pixel, inherently limiting the segmentation precision of object boundaries. The other is about RGB-D fusion. Recent state-of-the-art methods generally fuse RGB and depth networks with equal-weight score fusion, regardless of the varying contributions of the two modalities on delineating different categories in different scenes. To address the two problems, we first propose a locality-sensitive DeconvNet (LS-DeconvNet) to refine the boundary segmentation over each modality. LS-DeconvNet incorporates locally visual and geometric cues from the raw RGB-D data into each DeconvNet, which is able to learn to upsample the coarse convolutional maps with large context whilst recovering sharp object boundaries. Towards RGB-D fusion, we introduce a gated fusion layer to effectively combine the two LS-DeconvNets. This layer can learn to adjust the contributions of RGB and depth over each pixel for high-performance object recognition. Experiments on the large-scale SUN RGB-D dataset and the popular NYU-Depth v2 dataset show that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results for RGB-D indoor semantic segmentation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Cheng_Locality-Sensitive_Deconvolution_Networks_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yanhua Cheng, Rui Cai, Zhiwei Li, Xin Zhao, Kaiqi Huang
Localization of JPEG Double Compression Through Multi-Domain Convolutional Neural Networks	When an attacker wants to falsify an image, in most of cases she/he will perform a JPEG recompression. Different techniques have been developed based on diverse theoretical assumptions but very effective solutions have not been developed yet. Recently, machine learning based approaches have been started to appear in the field of image forensics to solve diverse tasks such as acquisition source identification and forgery detection. In this last case, the aim ahead would be to get a trained neural network able, given a to-be-checked image, to reliably localize the forged areas. With this in mind, our paper proposes a step forward in this direction by analyzing how a single or double JPEG compression can be revealed and localized using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Different kinds of input to the CNN have been taken into consideration, and various experiments have been carried out trying also to evidence potential issues to be further investigated.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w28/html/Caldelli_Localization_of_JPEG_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Irene Amerini; Tiberio Uricchio; Lamberto Ballan; Roberto Caldelli
Locally Adaptive Color Correction for Underwater Image Dehazing and Matching	Underwater images are known to be strongly deterio- rated by a combination of wavelength-dependent light at- tenuation and scattering. This results in complex color casts that depend both on the scene depth map and on the light spectrum. Color transfer, which is a technique of choice to counterbalance color casts, assumes stationary casts, de- fined by global parameters, and is therefore not directly ap- plicable to the locally variable color casts encountered in underwater scenarios. To fill this gap, this paper introduces an original fusion-based strategy to exploit color transfer while tuning the color correction locally, as a function of the light attenuation level estimated from the red channel. The Dark Channel Prior (DCP) is then used to restore the color compensated image, by inverting the simplified Koschmieder light transmission model, as for outdoor de- hazing. Our technique enhances image contrast in a quite effective manner and also supports accurate transmission map estimation. Our extensive experiments also show that our color correction strongly improves the effectiveness of local keypoints matching.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w12/html/Ancuti_Locally_Adaptive_Color_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Codruta O.

Loitering Behaviour Detection of Boats at Sea	We present in this paper a technique for Loitering detection based on the analysis of activity zones of the monitored area. Activity zones are learnt online employing a soft computing-based algorithm which takes as input the trajectory of object mobiles appearing on the scene. Statistical properties on zone occupancy and transition between zones makes it possible to discover abnormalities without the need to learn abnormal models beforehand. We have applied this approch to the PETS2017 IPATCH dataset and addressed the challenge on detecting skiff boats loitering around a protected ship, which eventually is attacked by the skiffs. Our results show that we can detect the suspicious behaviour on time to trigger an early warning.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w34/html/Patino_Loitering_Behaviour_Detection_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Luis Patino, James Ferryman
Look Closer to See Better: Recurrent Attention Convolutional Neural Network for Fine-Grained Image Recognition	Recognizing fine-grained categories (e.g., bird species) is difficult due to the challenges of discriminative region localization and fine-grained feature learning. Existing approaches predominantly solve these challenges independently, while neglecting the fact that region detection and fine-grained feature learning are mutually correlated and thus can reinforce each other. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent attention convolutional neural network (RA-CNN) which recursively learns discriminative region attention and region-based feature representation at multiple scales in a mutual reinforced way. The learning at each scale consists of a classification sub-network and an attention proposal sub-network (APN). The APN starts from full images, and iteratively generates region attention from coarse to fine by taking previous prediction as a reference, while the finer scale network takes as input an amplified attended region from previous scale in a recurrent way. The proposed RA-CNN is optimized by an intra-scale classification loss and an inter-scale ranking loss, to mutually learn accurate region attention and fine-grained representation. RA-CNN does not need bounding box/part annotations and can be trained end-to-end. We conduct comprehensive experiments and show that RA-CNN achieves the best performance in three fine-grained tasks, with relative accuracy gains of 3.3%, 3.7%, 3.8%, on CUB Birds, Stanford Dogs and Stanford Cars, respectively.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Fu_Look_Closer_to_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jianlong Fu, Heliang Zheng, Tao Mei
Look Into Person: Self-Supervised Structure-Sensitive Learning and a New Benchmark for Human Parsing	"Human parsing has recently attracted a lot of research interests due to its huge application potentials. However existing datasets have limited number of images and annotations, and lack the variety of human appearances and the coverage of challenging cases in unconstrained environment. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark ""Look into Person (LIP)"" that makes a significant advance in terms of scalability, diversity and difficulty, a contribution that we feel is crucial for future developments in human-centric analysis. This comprehensive dataset contains over 50,000 elaborately annotated images with 19 semantic part labels, which are captured from a wider range of viewpoints, occlusions and background complexity. Given these rich annotations we perform detailed analysis of the leading human parsing approaches, gaining insights into the success and failures of these methods. Furthermore, in contrast to the existing efforts on improving the feature discriminative capability, we solve human parsing by exploring a novel self-supervised structure-sensitive learning approach, which imposes human pose structures into parsing results without resorting to extra supervision (i.e., no need for specifically labeling human joints in model training). Our self-supervised learning framework can be injected into any advanced neural networks to help incorporate rich high-level knowledge regarding human joints from a global perspective and improve the parsing results. Extensive evaluations on our LIP and the public PASCAL-Person-Part dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Gong_Look_Into_Person_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ke Gong, Xiaodan Liang, Dongyu Zhang, Xiaohui Shen, Liang Lin
Looking Under the Hood: Deep Neural Network Visualization to Interpret Whole-Slide Image Analysis Outcomes for Colorectal Polyps	Histopathological characterization of colorectal polyps is an important principle for determining the risk of colorectal cancer and future rates of surveillance for patients. The process of characterization is time-intensive and requires years of specialized medical training. In this work, we propose a deep-learning-based image analysis approach that not only can accurately classify different types of polyps in whole-slide images, but also generates major regions and features on the slide through a model visualization approach. We argue that this visualization approach will make sense of the underlying reasons for the classification outcomes, significantly reduce the cognitive burden on clinicians, and improve the diagnostic accuracy for whole-slide image characterization tasks. Our results show the efficacy of this network visualization approach in recovering decisive regions and features for different types of polyps on whole-slide images according to the domain expert pathologists.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w8/html/Korbar_Looking_Under_the_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Bruno Korbar, Andrea M.

Loss Max-Pooling for Semantic Image Segmentation	In this work we introduce a novel loss max-pooling concept for handling imbalanced training data distributions, applicable as alternative loss layer in the context of deep neural networks for semantic image segmentation tasks. Most real-world semantic segmentation datasets exhibit long tail distributions with few object categories comprising the majority of data and consequently biasing the classifiers towards them. Our method adaptively re-weights the contributions of each pixel based on their observed losses, targeting under-performing classification results as often encountered for under-represented object classes. Moreover, our approach goes beyond conventional cost-sensitive learning attempts through adaptive considerations that allow us to indirectly address both, inter- and intra-class imbalances. We provide a theoretical justification of our approach, complementary to experimental analyses on standard semantic segmentation datasets. In our experiments on the challenging Cityscapes and Pascal VOC 2012 segmentation benchmarks we find consistently improved results, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Bulo_Loss_Max-Pooling_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Samuel Rota Bulo, Gerhard Neuhold, Peter Kontschieder
Low-Complexity Global Motion Estimation for Aerial Vehicles	Global motion estimation (GME) algorithms are typically employed on aerial videos captured by on-board UAV cameras to compensate for the artificial motion induced in these video frames due to camera motion. However, existing methods for GME have high computational complexity and are therefore not suitable for on-board processing in UAVs with limited computing capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel low complexity technique for GME that exploits the characteristics of aerial videos to only employ the minimum, yet, well-distributed features based on the scene complexity. Experiments performed on a mobile SoC platform, similar to the ones used in UAVs, confirm that the proposed technique achieves a speedup in execution time of over 40% without compromising the accuracy of the GME step when compared to a conventional method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w4/html/Ramakrishnan_Low-Complexity_Global_Motion_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Nirmala Ramakrishnan, Alok Prakash, Thambipillai Srikanthan
Low-Rank Bilinear Pooling for Fine-Grained Classification	Pooling second-order local feature statistics to form a high-dimensional bilinear feature has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of fine-grained classification tasks. To address the computational demands of high feature dimensionality, we propose to represent the covariance features as a matrix and apply a low-rank bilinear classifier. The resulting classifier can be evaluated without explicitly computing the bilinear feature map which allows for a large reduction in the compute time as well as decreasing the effective number of parameters to be learned. To further compress the model, we propose a classifier co-decomposition that factorizes the collection of bilinear classifiers into a common factor and compact per-class terms. The co-decomposition idea can be deployed through two convolutional layers and trained in an end-to-end architecture. We suggest a simple yet effective initialization that avoids explicitly first training and factorizing the larger bilinear classifiers. Through extensive experiments, we show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several public datasets for fine-grained classification trained with only category labels. Importantly, our final model is an order of magnitude smaller than the recently proposed compact bilinear model [??], and three orders smaller than the standard bilinear CNN model [??].	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kong_Low-Rank_Bilinear_Pooling_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shu Kong, Charless Fowlkes
Low-Rank Embedded Ensemble Semantic Dictionary for Zero-Shot Learning	Zero-shot learning for visual recognition has received much interest in the most recent years. However, the semantic gap across visual features and their underlying semantics is still the biggest obstacle in zero-shot learning. To fight off this hurdle, we propose an effective Low-rank Embedded Semantic Dictionary learning (LESD) through ensemble strategy. Specifically, we formulate a novel framework to jointly seek a low-rank embedding and semantic dictionary to link visual features with their semantic representations, which manages to capture shared features across different observed classes. Moreover, ensemble strategy is adopted to learn multiple semantic dictionaries to constitute the latent basis for the unseen classes. Consequently, our model could extract a variety of visual characteristics within objects, which can be well generalized to unknown categories. Extensive experiments on several zero-shot benchmarks verify that the proposed model can outperform the state-of-the-art approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ding_Low-Rank_Embedded_Ensemble_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhengming Ding, Ming Shao, Yun Fu
Low-Rank-Sparse Subspace Representation for Robust Regression	Learning robust regression model from high-dimensional corrupted data is an essential and difficult problem in many practical applications. The state-of-the-art methods have studied low-rank regression models that are robust against typical noises (like Gaussian noise and out-sample sparse noise) or outliers, such that a regression model can be learned from clean data lying on underlying subspaces. However, few of the existing low-rank regression methods can handle the outliers/noise lying on the sparsely corrupted disjoint subspaces. To address this issue, we propose a low-rank-sparse subspace representation for robust regression, hereafter referred to as LRS-RR in this paper. The main contribution include the following: (1) Unlike most of the existing regression methods, we propose an approach with two phases of low-rank-sparse subspace recovery and regression optimization being carried out simultaneously;(2) we also apply the linearized alternating direction method with adaptive penalty to solved the formulated LRS-RR problem and prove the convergence of the algorithm and analyze its complexity; (3) we demonstrate the efficiency of our method for the high-dimensional corrupted data on both synthetic data and two benchmark datasets against several state-of-the-art robust methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Low-Rank-Sparse_Subspace_Representation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yongqiang Zhang, Daming Shi, Junbin Gao, Dansong Cheng
MCMLSD: A Dynamic Programming Approach to Line Segment Detection	Prior approaches to line segment detection typically involve perceptual grouping in the image domain or global accumulation in the Hough domain. Here we propose a probabilistic algorithm that merges the advantages of both approaches. In a first stage lines are detected using a global probabilistic Hough approach. In the second stage each detected line is analyzed in the image domain to localize the line segments that generated the peak in the Hough map. By limiting search to a line, the distribution of segments over the sequence of points on the line can be modeled as a Markov chain, and a probabilistically optimal labelling can be computed exactly using a standard dynamic programming algorithm, in linear time. The Markov assumption also leads to an intuitive ranking method that uses the local marginal posterior probabilities to estimate the expected number of correctly labelled points on a segment. To assess the resulting Markov Chain Marginal Line Segment Detector (MCMLSD) we develop and apply a novel quantitative evaluation methodology that controls for under- and over-segmentation. Evaluation on the YorkUrbanDB dataset shows that the proposed MCMLSD method outperforms the state-of-the-art by a substantial margin.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Almazan_MCMLSD_A_Dynamic_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Emilio J.

MDNet: A Semantically and Visually Interpretable Medical Image Diagnosis Network	The inability to interpret the model prediction in semantically and visually meaningful ways is a well-known shortcoming of most existing computer-aided diagnosis methods. In this paper, we propose MDNet to establish a direct multimodal mapping between medical images and diagnostic reports that can read images, generate diagnostic reports, retrieve images by symptom descriptions, and visualize attention, to provide justifications of the network diagnosis process. MDNet includes an image model and a language model. The image model is proposed to enhance multi-scale feature ensembles and utilization efficiency. The language model, integrated with our improved attention mechanism, aims to read and explore discriminative image feature descriptions from reports to learn a direct mapping from sentence words to image pixels. The overall network is trained end-to-end by using our developed optimization strategy. Based on a pathology bladder cancer images and its diagnostic reports (BCIDR) dataset, we conduct sufficient experiments to demonstrate that MDNet outperforms comparative baselines. The proposed image model obtains state-of-the-art performance on two CIFAR datasets as well.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_MDNet_A_Semantically_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zizhao Zhang, Yuanpu Xie, Fuyong Xing, Mason McGough, Lin Yang
MIML-FCN+: Multi-Instance Multi-Label Learning via Fully Convolutional Networks With Privileged Information	Multi-instance multi-label (MIML) learning has many interesting applications in computer visions, including multi-object recognition and automatic image tagging. In these applications, additional information such as bounding-boxes, image captions and descriptions is often available during training phrase, which is referred as privileged information (PI). However, as existing works on learning using PI only consider instance-level PI (privileged instances), they fail to make use of bag-level PI (privileged bags) available in MIML learning. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a two-stream fully convolutional network, named MIML-FCN+, unified by a novel PI loss to solve the problem of MIML learning with privileged bags. Compared to the previous works on PI, the proposed MIML-FCN+ utilizes the readily available privileged bags, instead of hard-to-obtain privileged instances, making the system more general and practical in real world applications. As the proposed PI loss is convex and SGD-compatible and the framework itself is a fully convolutional network, MIML FCN+ can be easily integrated with state-of-the-art deep learning networks. Moreover, the flexibility of convolutional layers allows us to exploit structured correlations among instances to facilitate more effective training and testing. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MIML-FCN+, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in the application of multi-object recognition.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yang_MIML-FCN_Multi-Instance_Multi-Label_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hao Yang, Joey Tianyi Zhou, Jianfei Cai, Yew Soon Ong
Making 360deg Video Watchable in 2D: Learning Videography for Click Free Viewing	"360deg video requires human viewers to actively control ""where"" to look while watching the video. Although it provides a more immersive experience of the visual content, it also introduces additional burden for viewers; awkward interfaces to navigate the video lead to suboptimal viewing experiences. Virtual cinematography is an appealing direction to remedy these problems, but conventional methods are limited to virtual environments or rely on hand-crafted heuristics. We propose a new algorithm for virtual cinematography that automatically controls a virtual camera within a 360deg video. Compared to the state of the art, our algorithm allows more general camera control, avoids redundant outputs, and extracts its output videos substantially more efficiently. Experimental results on over 7 hours of real ""in the wild"" video show that our generalized camera control is crucial for viewing 360deg video, while the proposed efficient algorithm is essential for making the generalized control computationally tractable."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Su_Making_360deg_Video_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yu-Chuan Su, Kristen Grauman
Making Deep Neural Networks Robust to Label Noise: A Loss Correction Approach	We present a theoretically grounded approach to train deep neural networks, including recurrent networks, subject to class-dependent label noise. We propose two procedures for loss correction that are agnostic to both application domain and network architecture. They simply amount to at most a matrix inversion and multiplication, provided that we know the probability of each class being corrupted into another. We further show how one can estimate these probabilities, adapting a recent technique for noise estimation to the multi-class setting, and thus providing an end-to-end framework. Extensive experiments on MNIST, IMDB, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and a large scale dataset of clothing images employing a diversity of architectures --- stacking dense, convolutional, pooling, dropout, batch normalization, word embedding, LSTM and residual layers --- demonstrate the noise robustness of our proposals. Incidentally, we also prove that, when ReLU is the only non-linearity, the loss curvature is immune to class-dependent label noise.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Patrini_Making_Deep_Neural_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Giorgio Patrini, Alessandro Rozza, Aditya Krishna Menon, Richard Nock, Lizhen Qu
Making the v in VQA Matter: Elevating the Role of Image Understanding in Visual Question Answering	Problems at the intersection of vision and language are of significant importance both as challenging research questions and for the rich set of applications they enable. However, inherent structure in our world and bias in our language tend to be a simpler signal for learning than visual modalities, resulting in models that ignore visual information, leading to an inflated sense of their capability. We propose to counter these language priors for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and make vision (the V in VQA) matter! Specifically, we balance the popular VQA dataset (Antol et al., ICCV 2015) by collecting complementary images such that every question in our balanced dataset is associated with not just a single image, but rather a pair of similar images that result in two different answers to the question. Our dataset is by construction more balanced than the original VQA dataset and has approximately twice the number of image-question pairs. Our complete balanced dataset is publicly available at http://visualqa.org/ as part of the 2nd iteration of the Visual Question Answering Dataset and Challenge (VQA v2.0). We further benchmark a number of state-of-art VQA models on our balanced dataset. All models perform significantly worse on our balanced dataset, suggesting that these models have indeed learned to exploit language priors. This finding provides the first concrete empirical evidence for what seems to be a qualitative sense among practitioners. Finally, our data collection protocol for identifying complementary images enables us to develop a novel interpretable model, which in addition to providing an answer to the given (image, question) pair, also provides a counter-example based explanation. Specifically, it identifies an image that is similar to the original image, but it believes has a different answer to the same question. This can help in building trust for machines among their users.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Goyal_Making_the_v_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yash Goyal, Tejas Khot, Douglas Summers-Stay, Dhruv Batra, Devi Parikh
Manifold Guided Label Transfer for Deep Domain Adaptation	We propose a novel domain adaptation method for deep learning that combines adaptive batch normalization to produce a common feature-space between domains and label transfer with subspace alignment on deep features. The first step of our method automatically conditions the features from the source/target domain to have similar statistical distributions by normalizing the activations in each layer of our network using adaptive batch normalization. We then examine the clustering properties of the normalized features on a manifold to determine if the target features are well suited for the second of our algorithm, label-transfer. The second step of our method performs subspace alignment and k-means clustering on the feature manifold to transfer labels from the closest source cluster to each target cluster. The proposed manifold guided label transfer methods produce state of the art results for deep adaptation on several standard digit recognition datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w7/html/Minnehan_Manifold_Guided_Label_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Breton Minnehan, Andreas Savakis
Marginal Loss for Deep Face Recognition	Convolutional neural networks have significantly boosted the performance of face recognition in recent years due to its high capacity in learning discriminative features. In order to enhance the discriminative power of the deeply learned features, we propose a new supervision signal named marginal loss for deep face recognition. Specifically, the marginal loss simultaneously minimises the intra-class variances as well as maximises the inter-class distances by focusing on the marginal samples. With the joint supervision of softmax loss and marginal loss, we can easily train a robust CNNs to obtain more discriminative deep features. Extensive experiments on several relevant face recognition benchmarks, Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW), YouTube Faces (YTF), Cross-Age Celebrity Dataset (CACD), Age Database (AgeDB) and MegaFace Challenge, prove the effectiveness of the proposed marginal loss.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w33/html/Deng_Marginal_Loss_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jiankang Deng, Yuxiang Zhou, Stefanos Zafeiriou
Material Classification Using Frequency- and Depth-Dependent Time-Of-Flight Distortion	This paper presents a material classification method using an off-the-shelf Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera. We use a key observation that the depth measurement by a ToF camera is distorted in objects with certain materials, especially with translucent materials. We show that this distortion is caused by the variations of time domain impulse responses across materials and also by the measurement mechanism of the existing ToF cameras. Specifically, we reveal that the amount of distortion varies according to the modulation frequency of the ToF camera, the material of the object, and the distance between the camera and object. Our method uses the depth distortion of ToF measurements as features and achieves material classification of a scene. Effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical evaluation and real-world experiments, showing its capability of even classifying visually similar objects.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tanaka_Material_Classification_Using_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Kenichiro Tanaka, Yasuhiro Mukaigawa, Takuya Funatomi, Hiroyuki Kubo, Yasuyuki Matsushita, Yasushi Yagi
Matrix Tri-Factorization With Manifold Regularizations for Zero-Shot Learning	Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize objects of unseen classes with available training data from another set of seen classes. Existing solutions are focused on exploring knowledge transfer via an intermediate semantic embedding (e.g.s, attributes) shared between seen and unseen classes. In this paper, we propose a novel projection framework based on matrix tri-factorization with manifold regularizations. Specifically, we learn the semantic embedding projection by decomposing the visual feature matrix under the guidance of semantic embedding and class label matrices. By additionally introducing manifold regularizations on visual data and semantic embeddings, the learned projection can effectively captures the geometrical manifold structure residing in both visual and semantic spaces. To avoid the projection domain shift problem, we devise an effective prediction scheme by exploiting the test-time manifold structure. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts, yielding an average improvement ratio by 7.4% and 31.9% for the recognition and retrieval task, respectively.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xu_Matrix_Tri-Factorization_With_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xing Xu, Fumin Shen, Yang Yang, Dongxiang Zhang, Heng Tao Shen, Jingkuan Song
Matting and Depth Recovery of Thin Structures Using a Focal Stack	Thin structures such as fence, grass and vessels are common in photography and scientific imaging. They exhibit complex 3D structures with sharp depth variations/discontinuities and mutual occlusions. In this paper, we develop a method to estimate the occlusion matte and depths of thin structures from a focal image stack, which is obtained either by varying the focus/aperture of the lens or computed from a one-shot light field image. We propose an image formation model that explicitly describes the spatially varying optical blur and mutual occlusions for structures located at different depths. Based on the model, we derive an efficient MCMC inference algorithm that enables direct and analytical computations of the iterative update for the model/images without re-rendering images in the sampling process. Then, the depths of the thin structures are recovered using gradient descent with the differential terms computed using the image formation model. We apply the proposed method to scenes at both macro and micro scales. For macro-scale, we evaluate our method on scenes with complex 3D thin structures such as tree branches and grass. For micro-scale, we apply our method to in-vivo microscopic images of micro-vessels with diameters less than 50 um. To our knowledge, the proposed method is the first approach to reconstruct the 3D structures of micro-vessels from non-invasive in-vivo image measurements.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Liu_Matting_and_Depth_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chao Liu, Srinivasa G.

Measuring Energy Expenditure in Sports by Thermal Video Analysis	Estimation of human energy expenditure in sports and exercise contributes to performance analyses and tracking of physical activity levels. The focus of this work is to develop a video-based method for estimation of energy expenditure in athletes. We propose a method using thermal video analysis to automatically extract the cyclic motion pattern, in walking and running represented as steps, and analyse the frequency. Experiments are performed with one subject in two different tests, each at 5, 8, 10, and 12 km/h. The results of our proposed video-based method is compared to concurrent measurements of oxygen uptake. These initial experiments indicate a correlation between estimated step frequency and oxygen uptake. Based on the preliminary results we conclude that the proposed method has potential as a future non-invasive approach to estimate energy expenditure during sports.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w2/html/Gade_Measuring_Energy_Expenditure_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Rikke Gade, Ryan Godsk Larsen, Thomas B.

Measuring Glide-Reflection Symmetry in Human Movements Using Elastic Shape Analysis	Human bodies and movements exhibit inherent symmetry. However, an important class of everyday movements, such as walking, does not maintain symmetry at every time instance. The symmetry in these movements is a spatio-temporal glide-reflection symmetry. The ability to measure this type of symmetry will provide us opportunities for various computer-aided applications including health monitoring, rehabilitation, and athletic training. In this paper we propose a method that uses the tools from elastic shape analysis to provide continuous symmetry scores which measure the degree of glide-reflection symmetry in movements. These scores can be updated online after each frame, and easily combined to drive comprehensible feedback. Our preliminary experiment demonstrates that our symmetry scores can well distinguish between a normal gait and simulated stroke and Parkinsonian gaits. Our results also suggest that using the Riemannian elastic metric provides better scores than Euclidean approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w7/html/Wang_Measuring_Glide-Reflection_Symmetry_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Qiao Wang, Chaitanya Potaraju, Pavan Turaga
Memory-Augmented Attribute Manipulation Networks for Interactive Fashion Search	We introduce a new fashion search protocol where attribute manipulation is allowed within the interaction between users and search engines, e.g. manipulating the color attribute of the clothing from red to blue. It is particularly useful for image-based search when the query image cannot perfectly match user's expectation of the desired product. To build such a search engine, we propose a novel memory-augmented Attribute Manipulation Network (AMNet) which can manipulate image representation at the attribute level. Given a query image and some attributes that need to modify, AMNet can manipulate the intermediate representation encoding the unwanted attributes and change them to the desired ones through following four novel components: (1) a dual-path CNN architecture for discriminative deep attribute representation learning; (2) a memory block with an internal memory and a neural controller for prototype attribute representation learning and hosting; (3) an attribute manipulation network to modify the representation of the query image with the prototype feature retrieved from the memory block; (4) a loss layer which jointly optimizes the attribute classification loss and a triplet ranking loss over triplet images for facilitating precise attribute manipulation and image retrieving. Extensive experiments conducted on two large-scale fashion search datasets, i.e. DARN and DeepFashion, have demonstrated that AMNet is able to achieve remarkably good performance compared with well-designed baselines in terms of effectiveness of attribute manipulation and search accuracy.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhao_Memory-Augmented_Attribute_Manipulation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Bo Zhao, Jiashi Feng, Xiao Wu, Shuicheng Yan

We have evaluated system performance based on segmentation and classification on publicly available dataset. Experiment was conducted on 64000 blood cells and dataset is divided into 80% for training and 20% for testing.

Mimicking Very Efficient Network for Object Detection	Current CNN based object detectors need initialization from pre-trained ImageNet classification models, which are usually time-consuming. In this paper, we present a fully convolutional feature mimic framework to train very efficient CNN based detectors, which do not need ImageNet pre-training and achieve competitive performance as the large and slow models. We add supervision from high-level features of the large networks in training to help the small network better learn object representation. More specifically, we conduct a mimic method for the features sampled from the entire feature map and use a transform layer to map features from the small network onto the same dimension of the large network. In training the small network, we optimize the similarity between features sampled from the same region on the feature maps of both networks. Extensive experiments are conducted on pedestrian and common object detection tasks using VGG, Inception and ResNet. On both Caltech and Pascal VOC, we show that the modified 2.5x accelerated Inception network achieves competitive performance as the full Inception Network. Our faster model runs at 80 FPS for a 1000x1500 large input with only a minor degradation of performance on Caltech.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Li_Mimicking_Very_Efficient_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Quanquan Li, Shengying Jin, Junjie Yan
Mind the Class Weight Bias: Weighted Maximum Mean Discrepancy for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation	In domain adaptation, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) has been widely adopted as a discrepancy metric between the distributions of source and target domains. However, existing MMD-based domain adaptation methods generally ignore the changes of class prior distributions, i.e., class weight bias across domains. This remains an open problem but ubiquitous for domain adaptation, which can be caused by changes in sample selection criteria and application scenarios. We show that MMD cannot account for class weight bias and results in degraded domain adaptation performance. To address this issue, a weighted MMD model is proposed in this paper. Specifically, we introduce class-specific auxiliary weights into the original MMD for exploiting the class prior probability on source and target domains, whose challenge lies in the fact that the class label in target domain is unavailable. To account for it, our proposed weighted MMD model is defined by introducing an auxiliary weight for each class in the source domain, and a classification EM algorithm is suggested by alternating between assigning the pseudo-labels, estimating auxiliary weights and updating model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our weighted MMD over conventional MMD for domain adaptation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yan_Mind_the_Class_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hongliang Yan, Yukang Ding, Peihua Li, Qilong Wang, Yong Xu, Wangmeng Zuo
Minimum Delay Moving Object Detection	We present a general framework and method for detection of an object in a video based on apparent motion. The object moves relative to background motion at some unknown time in the video, and the goal is to detect and segment the object as soon it moves in an online manner. Due to unreliability of motion between frames, more than two frames are needed to reliably detect the object. Our method is designed to detect the object(s) with minimum delay, i.e., frames after the object moves, constraining the false alarms. Experiments on a new extensive dataset for moving object detection show that our method achieves less delay for all false alarm constraints than existing state-of-the-art.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lao_Minimum_Delay_Moving_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Dong Lao, Ganesh Sundaramoorthi
Mining Object Parts From CNNs via Active Question-Answering	Given a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is pre-trained for object classification, this paper proposes to use active question-answering to semanticize neural patterns in conv-layers of the CNN and mine part concepts. For each part concept, we mine neural patterns in the pre-trained CNN, which are related to the target part, and use these patterns to construct an And-Or graph (AOG) to represent a four-layer semantic hierarchy of the part. As an interpretable model, the AOG associates different CNN units with different explicit object parts. We use an active human-computer communication to incrementally grow such an AOG on the pre-trained CNN as follows. We allow the computer to actively identify objects, whose neural patterns cannot be explained by the current AOG. Then, the computer asks human about the unexplained objects, and uses the answers to automatically discover certain CNN patterns corresponding to the missing knowledge. We incrementally grow the AOG to encode new knowledge discovered during the active-learning process. In experiments, our method exhibits high learning efficiency. Our method uses about 1/6--1/3 of the part annotations for training, but achieves similar or better part-localization performance than fast-RCNN methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Mining_Object_Parts_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Quanshi Zhang, Ruiming Cao, Ying Nian Wu, Song-Chun Zhu
Missing Modalities Imputation via Cascaded Residual Autoencoder	Affordable sensors lead to an increasing interest in acquiring and modeling data with multiple modalities. Learning from multiple modalities has shown to significantly improve performance in object recognition. However, in practice it is common that the sensing equipment experiences unforeseeable malfunction or configuration issues, leading to corrupted data with missing modalities. Most existing multi-modal learning algorithms could not handle missing modalities, and would discard either all modalities with missing values or all corrupted data. To leverage the valuable information in the corrupted data, we propose to impute the missing data by leveraging the relatedness among different modalities. Specifically, we propose a novel Cascaded Residual Autoencoder (CRA) to impute missing modalities. By stacking residual autoencoders, CRA grows iteratively to model the residual between the current prediction and original data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of CRA on both the data imputation and the object recognition task on imputed data.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tran_Missing_Modalities_Imputation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Luan Tran, Xiaoming Liu, Jiayu Zhou, Rong Jin
Model-Based Iterative Restoration for Binary Document Image Compression With Dictionary Learning	The inherent noise in the observed (e.g., scanned) binary document image degrades the image quality and harms the compression ratio through breaking the pattern repentance and adding entropy to the document images. In this paper, we design a cost function in Bayesian framework with dictionary learning. Minimizing our cost function produces a restored image which has better quality than that of the observed noisy image, and a dictionary for representing and encoding the image. After the restoration, we use this dictionary (from the same cost function) to encode the restored image following the symbol-dictionary framework by JBIG2 standard with the lossless mode. Experimental results with a variety of document images demonstrate that our method improves the image quality compared with the observed image, and simultaneously improves the compression ratio. For the test images with synthetic noise, our method reduces the number of flipped pixels by 48.2% and improves the compression ratio by 36.36% as compared with the best encoding methods. For the test images with real noise, our method visually improves the image quality, and outperforms the cutting-edge method by 28.27% in terms of the compression ratio.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Guo_Model-Based_Iterative_Restoration_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yandong Guo, Cheng Lu, Jan P.

Modeling Relationships in Referential Expressions With Compositional Modular Networks	"People often refer to entities in an image in terms of their relationships with other entities. For example, ""the black cat sitting under the table"" refers to both a ""black cat"" entity and its relationship with another ""table"" entity. Understanding these relationships is essential for interpreting and grounding such natural language expressions. Most prior work focuses on either grounding entire referential expressions holistically to one region, or localizing relationships based on a fixed set of categories. In this paper we instead present a modular deep architecture capable of analyzing referential expressions into their component parts, identifying entities and relationships mentioned in the input expression and grounding them all in the scene. We call this approach Compositional Modular Networks (CMNs): a novel architecture that learns linguistic analysis and visual inference end-to-end. Our approach is built around two types of neural modules that inspect local regions and pairwise interactions between regions. We evaluate CMNs on multiple referential expression datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches on all tasks."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Hu_Modeling_Relationships_in_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ronghang Hu, Marcus Rohrbach, Jacob Andreas, Trevor Darrell, Kate Saenko
Modeling Sub-Event Dynamics in First-Person Action Recognition	First-person videos have unique characteristics such as heavy egocentric motion, strong preceding events, salient transitional activities and post-event impacts. Action recognition methods designed for third person videos may not optimally represent actions captured by first-person videos. We propose a method to represent the high level dynamics of sub-events in first-person videos by dynamically pooling features of sub-intervals of time series using a temporal feature pooling function. The sub-event dynamics are then temporally aligned to make a new series. To keep track of how the sub-event dynamics evolve over time, we recursively employ the Fast Fourier Transform on a pyramidal temporal structure. The Fourier coefficients of the segment define the overall video representation. We perform experiments on two existing benchmark first-person video datasets which have been captured in a controlled environment. Addressing this gap, we introduce a new dataset collected from YouTube which has a larger number of classes and a greater diversity of capture conditions thereby more closely depicting real-world challenges in first-person video analysis. We compare our method to state-of-the-art first person and generic video recognition algorithms.

Modeling Temporal Dynamics and Spatial Configurations of Actions Using Two-Stream Recurrent Neural Networks	Recently, skeleton based action recognition gains more popularity due to cost-effective depth sensors coupled with real-time skeleton estimation algorithms. Traditional approaches based on handcrafted features are limited to represent the complexity of motion patterns. Recent methods that use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to handle raw skeletons only focus on the contextual dependency in the temporal domain and neglect the spatial configurations of articulated skeletons. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream RNN architecture to model both temporal dynamics and spatial configurations for skeleton based action recognition. We explore two different structures for the temporal stream: stacked RNN and hierarchical RNN. Hierarchical RNN is designed according to human body kinematics. We also propose two effective methods to model the spatial structure by converting the spatial graph into a sequence of joints. To improve generalization of our model, we further exploit 3D transformation based data augmentation techniques including rotation and scaling transformation to transform the 3D coordinates of skeletons during training. Experiments on 3D action recognition benchmark datasets show that our method brings a considerable improvement for a variety of actions, i.e., generic actions, interaction activities and gestures.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_Modeling_Temporal_Dynamics_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hongsong Wang, Liang Wang
Monitoring Ethiopian Wheat Fungus With Satellite Imagery and Deep Feature Learning	Wheat is the most important Ethiopian crop, and rust one of its greatest antagonists. There is a need for cheap and scalable rust monitoring in the developing world, but existing methods employ costly data collection techniques. We introduce a scalable, accurate, and inexpensive method for tracking outbreaks with publicly available remote sensing data. Our approach improves existing techniques in two ways. First, we forgo the spectral features employed by the remote sensing community in favor of automatically learned features generated by Convolutional and Long Short-Term Memory Networks. Second, we aggregate data into larger geospatial regions. We evaluate our approach on nine years of agricultural outcomes, show that it outperforms competing techniques, and demonstrate its predictive foresight. This is a promising new direction in crop disease monitoring, one that has the potential to grow more powerful with time.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w18/html/Pryzant_Monitoring_Ethiopian_Wheat_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Reid Pryzant, Stefano Ermon, David Lobell
More Is Less: A More Complicated Network With Less Inference Complexity	In this paper, we present a novel and general network structure towards accelerating the inference process of convolutional neural networks, which is more complicated in network structure yet with less inference complexity. The core idea is to equip each original convolutional layer with another low-cost collaborative layer (LCCL), and the element-wise multiplication of the ReLU outputs of these two parallel layers produces the layer-wise output. The combined layer is potentially more discriminative than the original convolutional layer, and its inference is faster for two reasons: 1) the zero cells of the LCCL feature maps will remain zero after element-wise multiplication, and thus it is safe to skip the calculation of the corresponding high-cost convolution in the original convolutional layer; 2) LCCL is very fast if it is implemented as a 1*1 convolution or only a single filter shared by all channels. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ILSCRC-2012 benchmarks show that our proposed network structure can accelerate the inference process by 32% on average with negligible performance drop.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Dong_More_Is_Less_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xuanyi Dong, Junshi Huang, Yi Yang, Shuicheng Yan
Motion Language of Stereo Image Sequence	This paper proposes a method for the symbolisation of temporal changes of the environments around the autonomous robot in a work space using the scene flow field for recognition of events. The proposed algorithm is a two-phase method for the accurate computation of the scene flow field. The algorithm next symbolises the motion field as a string of words using directional statistics. Our method extracts a string of words of motion in front of the robots from images captured by a robot-mounted stereo camera system. We evaluate performance of our method using KITTI scene flow Dataset 2015. The results shows the efficiency of the method for the extraction of events in front of a robot.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w13/html/Kato_Motion_Language_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tomoya Kato, Hayato Itoh, Atsushi Imiya
MuCaLe-Net: Multi Categorical-Level Networks to Generate More Discriminating Features	In a transfer-learning scheme, the intermediate layers of a pre-trained CNN are employed as universal image representation to tackle many visual classification problems. The current trend to generate such representation is to learn a CNN on a large set of images labeled among the most specific categories. Such processes ignore potential relations between categories, as well as the categorical-levels used by humans to classify. In this paper, we propose Multi Categorical-Level Networks (MuCaLe-Net) that include human-categorization knowledge into the CNN learning process. A MuCaLe-Net separates generic categories from each other while it independently distinguishes specific ones. It thereby generates different features in the intermediate layers that are complementary when combined together. Advantageously, our method does not require additive data nor annotation to train the network. The extensive experiments over four publicly available benchmarks of image classification exhibit state-of-the-art performances.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tamaazousti_MuCaLe-Net_Multi_Categorical-Level_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Youssef Tamaazousti, Herve Le Borgne, Celine Hudelot
Multi-Attention Network for One Shot Learning	One-shot learning is a challenging problem where the aim is to recognize a class identified by a single training image. Given the practical importance of one-shot learning, it seems surprising that the rich information present in the class tag itself has largely been ignored. Most existing approaches restrict the use of the class tag to finding similar classes and transferring classifiers or metrics learned thereon. We demonstrate here, in contrast, that the class tag can inform one-shot learning as a guide to visual attention on the training image for creating the image representation. This is motivated by the fact that human beings can better interpret a training image if the class tag of the image is understood. Specifically, we design a neural network architecture which takes the semantic embedding of the class tag to generate attention maps and uses those attention maps to create the image features for one-shot learning. Note that unlike other applications, our task requires that the learned attention generator can be generalized to novel classes. We show that this can be realized by representing class tags with distributed word embeddings and learning the attention map generator from an auxiliary training set. Also, we design a multiple-attention scheme to extract richer information from the exemplar image and this leads to substantial performance improvement. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that the proposed approach leads to superior performance over the baseline methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_Multi-Attention_Network_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Peng Wang, Lingqiao Liu, Chunhua Shen, Zi Huang, Anton van den Hengel, Heng Tao Shen
Multi-Context Attention for Human Pose Estimation	In this paper, we propose to incorporate convolutional neural networks with a multi-context attention mechanism into an end-to-end framework for human pose estimation. We adopt stacked hourglass networks to generate attention maps from features at multiple resolutions with various semantics. The Conditional Random Field (CRF) is utilized to model the correlations among neighboring regions in the attention map. We further combine the holistic attention model, which focuses on the global consistency of the full human body, and the body part attention model, which focuses on detailed descriptions for different body parts. Hence our model has the ability to focus on different granularity from local salient regions to global semantic consistent spaces. Additionally, we design novel Hourglass Residual Units (HRUs) to increase the receptive field of the network. These units are extensions of residual units with a side branch incorporating filters with larger receptive field, hence features with various scales are learned and combined within the HRUs. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-context attention mechanism and the hourglass residual units is evaluated on two widely used human pose estimation benchmarks. Our approach outperforms all existing methods on both benchmarks over all the body parts. Code has been made publicly available.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chu_Multi-Context_Attention_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xiao Chu, Wei Yang, Wanli Ouyang, Cheng Ma, Alan L.

Multi-Level Attention Networks for Visual Question Answering	Inspired by the recent success of text-based question answering, visual question answering (VQA) is proposed to automatically answer natural language questions with the reference to a given image. Compared with text-based QA, VQA is more challenging because the reasoning process on visual domain needs both effective semantic embedding and fine-grained visual understanding. Existing approaches predominantly infer answers from the abstract low-level visual features, while neglecting the modeling of high-level image semantics and the rich spatial context of regions. To solve the challenges, we propose a multi-level attention network for visual question answering that can simultaneously reduce the semantic gap by semantic attention and benefit fine-grained spatial inference by visual attention. First, we generate semantic concepts from high-level semantics in convolutional neural networks (CNN) and select those question-related concepts as semantic attention. Second, we encode region-based middle-level outputs from CNN into spatially-embedded representation by a bidirectional recurrent neural network, and further pinpoint the answer-related regions by multiple layer perceptron as visual attention. Third, we jointly optimize semantic attention, visual attention and question embedding by a softmax classifier to infer the final answer. Extensive experiments show the proposed approach outperforms the-state-of-arts on two challenging VQA datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yu_Multi-Level_Attention_Networks_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Dongfei Yu, Jianlong Fu, Tao Mei, Yong Rui
Multi-Modal Mean-Fields via Cardinality-Based Clamping	Mean Field inference is central to statistical physics. It has attracted much interest in the Computer Vision community to efficiently solve problems expressible in terms of large Conditional Random Fields. However, since it models the posterior probability distribution as a product of marginal probabilities, it may fail to properly account for important dependencies between variables. We therefore replace the fully factorized distribution of Mean Field by a weighted mixture of such distributions, that similarly minimizes the KL-Divergence to the true posterior. By introducing two new ideas, namely, conditioning on groups of variables instead of single ones and using a parameter of the conditional random field potentials, that we identify to the temperature in the sense of statistical physics to select such groups, we can perform this minimization efficiently. Our extension of the clamping method proposed in previous works allows us to both produce a more descriptive approximation of the true posterior and, inspired by the diverse MAP paradigms, fit a mixture of Mean Field approximations. We demonstrate that this positively impacts real-world algorithms that initially relied on mean fields.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Baque_Multi-Modal_Mean-Fields_via_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Pierre Baque, Francois Fleuret, Pascal Fua
Multi-Modal Score Fusion and Decision Trees for Explainable Automatic Job Candidate Screening From Video CVs	We describe an end-to-end system for explainable automatic job candidate screening from video CVs. In this application, audio, face and scene features are first computed from an input video CV, using rich feature sets. These multiple modalities are fed into modality-specific regressors to predict apparent personality traits and a variable that predicts whether the subject will be invited to the interview. The base learners are stacked to an ensemble of decision trees to produce the outputs of the quantitative stage, and a single decision tree, combined with a rule-based algorithm produces interview decision explanations based on the quantitative results. The proposed system in this work ranks first in both quantitative and qualitative stages of the CVPR 2017 ChaLearn Job Candidate Screening Coopetition.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w26/html/Kaya_Multi-Modal_Score_Fusion_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Heysem Kaya, Furkan Gurpinar, Albert Ali Salah
Multi-Object Tracking With Quadruplet Convolutional Neural Networks	We propose Quadruplet Convolutional Neural Networks (Quad-CNN) for multi-object tracking, which learn to associate object detections across frames using quadruplet losses. The proposed networks consider target appearances together with their temporal adjacencies for data association. Unlike conventional ranking losses, the quadruplet loss enforces an additional constraint that makes temporally adjacent detections more closely located than the ones with large temporal gaps. We also employ a multi-task loss to jointly learn object association and bounding box regression for better localization. The whole network is trained end-to-end. For tracking, the target association is performed by minimax label propagation using the metric learned from the proposed network. We evaluate performance of our multi-object tracking algorithm on public MOT Challenge datasets, and achieve outstanding results.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Son_Multi-Object_Tracking_With_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jeany Son, Mooyeol Baek, Minsu Cho, Bohyung Han
Multi-Resolution Data Fusion for Super-Resolution Electron Microscopy	"Perhaps surprisingly, all electron microscopy (EM) data collected to date is less than a cubic millimeter -- presenting a huge demand in the materials and biological sciences to image at greater speed and lower dosage, while maintaining resolution. Traditional EM imaging based on homogeneous raster scanning severely limits the volume of high-resolution data that can be collected, and presents a fundamental limitation to understanding physical processes such as material deformation and crack propagation. We introduce a multi-resolution data fusion (MDF) method for super-resolution computational EM. Our method combines innovative data acquisition with novel algorithmic techniques to dramatically improve the resolution/volume/speed trade-off. The key to our approach is to collect the entire sample at low resolution, while simultaneously collecting a small fraction of data at high resolution. The high-resolution measurements are then used to create a material-specific model that is used within the ""plug-and-play"" framework to dramatically improve resolution of the low-resolution data. We present results using FEI electron microscope data that demonstrate super-resolution factors of 4x-16x, while substantially maintaining high image quality and reducing dosage."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w12/html/Sreehari_Multi-Resolution_Data_Fusion_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Suhas Sreehari, S.

Multi-Scale Continuous CRFs as Sequential Deep Networks for Monocular Depth Estimation	This paper addresses the problem of depth estimation from a single still image. Inspired by recent works on multi-scale convolutional neural networks (CNN), we propose a deep model which fuses complementary information derived from multiple CNN side outputs. Different from previous methods, the integration is obtained by means of continuous Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). In particular, we propose two different variations, one based on a cascade of multiple CRFs, the other on a unified graphical model. By designing a novel CNN implementation of mean-field updates for continuous CRFs, we show that both proposed models can be regarded as sequential deep networks and that training can be performed end-to-end. Through extensive experimental evaluation we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and establish new state of the art results on publicly available datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xu_Multi-Scale_Continuous_CRFs_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Dan Xu, Elisa Ricci, Wanli Ouyang, Xiaogang Wang, Nicu Sebe
Multi-Scale FCN With Cascaded Instance Aware Segmentation for Arbitrary Oriented Word Spotting in the Wild	Scene text detection has attracted great attention these years. Text potentially exist in a wide variety of images or videos and play an important role in understanding the scene. In this paper, we present a novel text detection algorithm which is composed of two cascaded steps: (1) a multi-scale fully convolutional neural network (FCN) is proposed to extract text block regions; (2) a novel instance (word or line) aware segmentation is designed to further remove false positives and obtain word instances. The proposed algorithm can accurately localize word or text line in arbitrary orientations, including curved text lines which cannot be handled in a lot of other frameworks. Our algorithm achieved state-of-the-art performance in ICDAR 2013 (IC13), ICDAR 2015 (IC15) and CUTE80 and Street View Text (SVT) benchmark datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/He_Multi-Scale_FCN_With_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Dafang He, Xiao Yang, Chen Liang, Zihan Zhou, Alexander G.

Multi-Scale Fully Convolutional Network for Face Detection in the Wild	Face detection is a classical problem in computer vision. It is still a difficult task due to many nuisances that naturally occur in the wild. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale fully convolutional network for face detection. To reduce computation, the intermediate convolutional feature maps (conv) are shared by every scale model. We up-sample and down-sample the final conv map to approximate K levels of a feature pyramid, leading to a wide range of face scales that can be detected. At each feature pyramid level, a FCN is trained end-to-end to deal with faces in a small range of scale change. Because of the up-sampling, our method can detect very small faces (10x10 pixels). We test our MS-FCN detector on four public face detection datasets, including FDDB, WIDER FACE, AFW and PASCAL FACE. Extensive experiments show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Also, MS-FCN runs at 23 FPS on a GPU for images of size 640x480 with no assumption on the minimum detectable face size.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w33/html/Bai_Multi-Scale_Fully_Convolutional_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yancheng Bai, Bernard Ghanem
Multi-Task Clustering of Human Actions by Sharing Information	Sharing information between multiple tasks can enhance the accuracy of human action recognition systems. However, using shared information to improve multi-task human action clustering has never been considered before, and cannot be achieved using existing clustering methods. In this work, we present a novel and effective Multi-Task Information Bottleneck (MTIB) clustering method, which is capable of exploring the shared information between multiple action clustering tasks to improve the performance of individual task. Our motivation is that, different action collections always share many similar action patterns, and exploiting the shared information can lead to improved performance. Specifically, MTIB generally formulates this problem as an information loss minimization function. In this function, the shared information can be quantified by the distributional correlation of clusters in different tasks, which is based on a high-level common vocabulary constructed through a novel agglomerative information maximization method. Extensive experiments on two kinds of challenging data sets, including realistic action data sets (HMDB & UCF50, Olympic & YouTube), and cross-view data sets (IXMAS, WVU), show that the proposed approach compares favorably to the state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yan_Multi-Task_Clustering_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xiaoqiang Yan, Shizhe Hu, Yangdong Ye
Multi-Task Correlation Particle Filter for Robust Object Tracking	In this paper, we propose a multi-task correlation particle filter (MCPF) for robust visual tracking. We first present the multi-task correlation filter (MCF) that takes the interdependencies among different features into account to learn correlation filters jointly. The proposed MCPF is designed to exploit and complement the strength of a MCF and a particle filter. Compared with existing tracking methods based on correlation filters and particle filters, the proposed tracker has several advantages. First, it can shepherd the sampled particles toward the modes of the target state distribution via the MCF, thereby resulting in robust tracking performance. Second, it can effectively handle large-scale variation via a particle sampling strategy. Third, it can effectively maintain multiple modes in the posterior density using fewer particles than conventional particle filters, thereby lowering the computational cost. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MCPF performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Multi-Task_Correlation_Particle_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tianzhu Zhang, Changsheng Xu, Ming-Hsuan Yang
Multi-View 3D Object Detection Network for Autonomous Driving	This paper aims at high-accuracy 3D object detection in autonomous driving scenario. We propose Multi-View 3D networks (MV3D), a sensory-fusion framework that takes both LIDAR point cloud and RGB images as input and predicts oriented 3D bounding boxes. We encode the sparse 3D point cloud with a compact multi-view representation. The network is composed of two subnetworks: one for 3D object proposal generation and another for multi-view feature fusion. The proposal network generates 3D candidate boxes efficiently from the bird's eye view representation of 3D point cloud. We design a deep fusion scheme to combine region-wise features from multiple views and enable interactions between intermediate layers of different paths. Experiments on the challenging KITTI benchmark show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by around 25% and 30% AP on the tasks of 3D localization and 3D detection. In addition, for 2D detection, our approach obtains 14.9% higher AP than the state-of-the-art on the hard data among the LIDAR-based methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chen_Multi-View_3D_Object_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xiaozhi Chen, Huimin Ma, Ji Wan, Bo Li, Tian Xia
Multi-View Supervision for Single-View Reconstruction via Differentiable Ray Consistency	We study the notion of consistency between a 3D shape and a 2D observation and propose a differentiable formulation which allows computing gradients of the 3D shape given an observation from an arbitrary view. We do so by reformulating view consistency using a differentiable ray consistency (DRC) term. We show that this formulation can be incorporated in a learning framework to leverage different types of multi-view observations e.g. foreground masks, depth, color images, semantics etc. as supervision for learning single-view 3D prediction. We present empirical analysis of our technique in a controlled setting. We also show that this approach allows us to improve over existing techniques for single-view reconstruction of objects from the PASCAL VOC dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tulsiani_Multi-View_Supervision_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shubham Tulsiani, Tinghui Zhou, Alexei A.

Multi-Way Multi-Level Kernel Modeling for Neuroimaging Classification	Owing to prominence as a diagnostic tool for probing the neural correlates of cognition, neuroimaging tensor data has been the focus of intense investigation. Although many supervised tensor learning approaches have been proposed, they either cannot capture the nonlinear relationships of tensor data or cannot preserve the complex multi-way structural information. In this paper, we propose a Multi-way Multi-level Kernel (MMK) model that can extract discriminative, nonlinear and structural preserving representations of tensor data. Specifically, we introduce a kernelized CP tensor factorization technique, which is equivalent to performing the low-rank tensor factorization in a possibly much higher dimensional space that is implicitly defined by the kernel function. We further employ a multi-way nonlinear feature mapping to derive the dual structural preserving kernels, which are used in conjunction with kernel machines (e.g., SVM). Extensive experiments on real-world neuroimages demonstrate that the proposed MMK method can effectively boost the classification performance on diverse brain disorders (i.e., Alzheimer's disease, ADHD, and HIV).	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/He_Multi-Way_Multi-Level_Kernel_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Lifang He, Chun-Ta Lu, Hao Ding, Shen Wang, Linlin Shen, Philip S. Yu, Ann B. Ragin
Multigrid Neural Architectures	We propose a multigrid extension of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Rather than manipulating representations living on a single spatial grid, our network layers operate across scale space, on a pyramid of grids. They consume multigrid inputs and produce multigrid outputs; convolutional filters themselves have both within-scale and cross-scale extent. This aspect is distinct from simple multiscale designs, which only process the input at different scales. Viewed in terms of information flow, a multigrid network passes messages across a spatial pyramid. As a consequence, receptive field size grows exponentially with depth, facilitating rapid integration of context. Most critically, multigrid structure enables networks to learn internal attention and dynamic routing mechanisms, and use them to accomplish tasks on which modern CNNs fail. Experiments demonstrate wide-ranging performance advantages of multigrid. On CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks, flipping from a single grid to multigrid within the standard CNN paradigm improves accuracy, while being compute and parameter efficient. Multigrid is independent of other architectural choices; we show synergy in combination with residual connections. Multigrid yields dramatic improvement on a synthetic semantic segmentation dataset. Most strikingly, relatively shallow multigrid networks can learn to directly perform spatial transformation tasks, where, in contrast, current CNNs fail. Together, our results suggest that continuous evolution of features on a multigrid pyramid is a more powerful alternative to existing CNN designs on a flat grid.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ke_Multigrid_Neural_Architectures_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tsung-Wei Ke, Michael Maire, Stella X.

Multimodal Transfer: A Hierarchical Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Fast Artistic Style Transfer	Transferring artistic styles onto everyday photographs has become an extremely popular task in both academia and industry. Recently, offline training has replaced online iterative optimization, enabling nearly real-time stylization. When those stylization networks are applied directly to high-resolution images, however, the style of localized regions often appears less similar to the desired artistic style. This is because the transfer process fails to capture small, intricate textures and maintain correct texture scales of the artworks. Here we propose a multimodal convolutional neural network that takes into consideration faithful representations of both color and luminance channels, and performs stylization hierarchically with multiple losses of increasing scales. Compared to state-of-the-art networks, our network can also perform style transfer in nearly real-time by performing much more sophisticated training offline. By properly handling style and texture cues at multiple scales using several modalities, we can transfer not just large-scale, obvious style cues but also subtle, exquisite ones. That is, our scheme can generate results that are visually pleasing and more similar to multiple desired artistic styles with color and texture cues at multiple scales.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_Multimodal_Transfer_A_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xin Wang, Geoffrey Oxholm, Da Zhang, Yuan-Fang Wang
Multiple Instance Detection Network With Online Instance Classifier Refinement	Of late, weakly supervised object detection is with great importance in object recognition. Based on deep learning, weakly supervised detectors have achieved many promising results. However, compared with fully supervised detection, it is more challenging to train deep network based detectors in a weakly supervised manner. Here we formulate weakly supervised detection as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, where instance classifiers (object detectors) are put into the network as hidden nodes. We propose a novel online instance classifier refinement algorithm to integrate MIL and the instance classifier refinement procedure into a single deep network, and train the network end-to-end with only image-level supervision, i.e., without object location information. More precisely, instance labels inferred from weak supervision are propagated to their spatially overlapped instances to refine instance classifier online. The iterative instance classifier refinement procedure is implemented using multiple streams in deep network, where each stream supervises its latter stream. Weakly supervised object detection experiments are carried out on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 benchmarks. We obtain 47% mAP on VOC 2007 that significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tang_Multiple_Instance_Detection_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Peng Tang, Xinggang Wang, Xiang Bai, Wenyu Liu
Multiple People Tracking by Lifted Multicut and Person Re-Identification	Tracking multiple persons in a monocular video of a crowded scene is a challenging task. Humans can master it even if they loose track of a person locally by re-identifying the same person based on their appearance. Care must be taken across long distances, as similar-looking persons need not be identical. In this work, we propose a novel graph-based formulation that links and clusters person hypotheses over time by solving an instance of a minimum cost lifted multicut problem. Our model generalizes previous works by introducing a mechanism for adding long-range attractive connections between nodes in the graph without modifying the original set of feasible solutions. This allows us to reward tracks that assign detections of similar appearance to the same person in a way that does not introduce implausible solutions. To effectively match hypotheses over longer temporal gaps we develop new deep architectures for re-identification of people. They combine holistic representations extracted with deep networks and body pose layout obtained with a state-of-the-art pose estimation model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our formulation by reporting a new state-of-the-art for the MOT16 benchmark.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tang_Multiple_People_Tracking_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Siyu Tang, Mykhaylo Andriluka, Bjoern Andres, Bernt Schiele
Multiple-Scattering Microphysics Tomography	Scattering effects in images, including those related to haze, fog and appearance of clouds, are fundamentally dictated by microphysical characteristics of the scatterers. This work defines and derives recovery of these characteristics, in a three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous medium. Recovery is based on a novel tomography approach. Multi-view (multi-angular) and multi-spectral data are linked to the underlying microphysics using 3D radiative transfer, accounting for multiple-scattering. Despite the nonlinearity of the tomography model, inversion is enabled using a few approximations that we describe. As a case study, we focus on passive remote sensing of the atmosphere, where scatterer retrieval can benefit modeling and forecasting of weather, climate and pollution.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Levis_Multiple-Scattering_Microphysics_Tomography_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Aviad Levis, Yoav Y.

NID-SLAM: Robust Monocular SLAM Using Normalised Information Distance	We propose a direct monocular SLAM algorithm based on the Normalised Information Distance (NID) metric. In contrast to current state-of-the-art direct methods based on photometric error minimisation, our information-theoretic NID metric provides robustness to appearance variation due to lighting, weather and structural changes in the scene. We demonstrate successful localisation and mapping across changes in lighting with a synthetic indoor scene, and across changes in weather (direct sun, rain, snow) using real-world data collected from a vehicle-mounted camera. Our approach runs in real-time on a consumer GPU using OpenGL, and provides comparable localisation accuracy to state-of-the-art photometric methods but significantly outperforms both direct and feature-based methods in robustness to appearance changes.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Pascoe_NID-SLAM_Robust_Monocular_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Geoffrey Pascoe, Will Maddern, Michael Tanner, Pedro Pinies, Paul Newman

NTIRE 2017 Challenge on Single Image Super-Resolution: Methods and Results	This paper reviews the first challenge on single image super-resolution (restoration of rich details in an low resolution image) with focus on proposed solutions and results. A new DIVerse 2K resolution image dataset (DIV2K) was employed. The challenge had 6 competitions divided into 2 tracks with 3 magnification factors each.

Network Dissection: Quantifying Interpretability of Deep Visual Representations	We propose a general framework called Network Dissection for quantifying the interpretability of latent representations of CNNs by evaluating the alignment between individual hidden units and a set of semantic concepts. Given any CNN model, the proposed method draws on a data set of concepts to score the semantics of hidden units at each intermediate convolutional layer. The units with semantics are labeled across a broad range of visual concepts including objects, parts, scenes, textures, materials, and colors. We use the proposed method to test the hypothesis that interpretability is an axis-independent property of the representation space, then we apply the method to compare the latent representations of various networks when trained to solve different classification problems. We further analyze the effect of training iterations, compare networks trained with different initializations, and measure the effect of dropout and batch normalization on the interpretability of deep visual representations. We demonstrate that the proposed method can shed light on characteristics of CNN models and training methods that go beyond measurements of their discriminative power	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Bau_Network_Dissection_Quantifying_CVPR_2017_paper.html	David Bau, Bolei Zhou, Aditya Khosla, Aude Oliva, Antonio Torralba
Network Sketching: Exploiting Binary Structure in Deep CNNs	Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with deep architectures have substantially advanced the state-of-the-art in computer vision tasks. However, deep networks are typically resource-intensive and thus difficult to be deployed on mobile devices. Recently, CNNs with binary weights have shown compelling efficiency to the community, whereas the accuracy of such models is usually unsatisfactory in practice. In this paper, we introduce network sketching as a novel technique of pursuing binary-weight CNNs, targeting at more faithful inference and better trade-off for practical applications. Our basic idea is to exploit binary structure directly in pre-trained filter banks and to produce binary-weight models via tensor expansion. The whole process can be treated as a coarse-to-fine model approximation, akin to the pencil drawing steps of outlining and shading. To further speedup the generated models, namely the sketches, we also propose an associative implementation of binary tensor convolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that a proper sketch of AlexNet (or ResNet) outperforms the existing binary-weight models by large margins on the ImageNet large scale classification task, while the committed memory for network parameters only exceeds a little.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Guo_Network_Sketching_Exploiting_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yiwen Guo, Anbang Yao, Hao Zhao, Yurong Chen
Neural Aggregation Network for Video Face Recognition	This paper presents a Neural Aggregation Network (NAN) for video face recognition. The network takes a face video or face image set of a person with a variable number of face images as its input, and produces a compact, fixed-dimension feature representation for recognition. The whole network is composed of two modules. The feature embedding module is a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which maps each face image to a feature vector. The aggregation module consists of two attention blocks which adaptively aggregate the feature vectors to form a single feature inside the convex hull spanned by them. Due to the attention mechanism, the aggregation is invariant to the image order. Our NAN is trained with a standard classification or verification loss without any extra supervision signal, and we found that it automatically learns to advocate high-quality face images while repelling low-quality ones such as blurred, occluded and improperly exposed faces. The experiments on IJB-A, YouTube Face, Celebrity-1000 video face recognition benchmarks show that it consistently outperforms naive aggregation methods and achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yang_Neural_Aggregation_Network_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jiaolong Yang, Peiran Ren, Dongqing Zhang, Dong Chen, Fang Wen, Hongdong Li, Gang Hua
Neural Face Editing With Intrinsic Image Disentangling	"Traditional face editing methods often require a number of sophisticated and task specific algorithms to be applied one after the other --- a process that is tedious, fragile, and computationally intensive. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end generative adversarial network that infers a face-specific disentangled representation of intrinsic face properties, including shape (i.e. normals), albedo, and lighting, and an alpha matte. We show that this network can be trained on ""in-the-wild"" images by incorporating an in-network physically-based image formation module and appropriate loss functions. Our disentangling latent representation allows for semantically relevant edits, where one aspect of facial appearance can be manipulated while keeping orthogonal properties fixed, and we demonstrate its use for a number of facial editing applications."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Shu_Neural_Face_Editing_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhixin Shu, Ersin Yumer, Sunil Hadap, Kalyan Sunkavalli, Eli Shechtman, Dimitris Samaras
Neural Scene De-Rendering	e study the problem of holistic scene understanding. We would like to obtain a compact, expressive, and interpretable representation of scenes that encodes information such as the number of objects and their categories, poses, positions, etc. Such a representation would allow us to reason about and even reconstruct or manipulate elements of the scene. Previous works have used encoder-decoder based neural architectures to learn image representations; however, representations obtained in this way are typically uninterpretable, or only explain a single object in the scene. In this work, we propose a new approach to learn an interpretable distributed representation of scenes. Our approach employs a deterministic rendering function as the decoder, mapping a naturally structured and disentangled scene description, which we named scene XML, to an image. By doing so, the encoder is forced to perform the inverse of the rendering operation (a.k.a. de-rendering) to transform an input image to the structured scene XML that the decoder used to produce the image. We use a object proposal based encoder that is trained by minimizing both the supervised prediction and the unsupervised reconstruction errors. Experiments demonstrate that our approach works well on scene de-rendering with two different graphics engines, and our learned representation can be easily adapted for a wide range of applications like image editing, inpainting, visual analogy-making, and image captioning.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wu_Neural_Scene_De-Rendering_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jiajun Wu, Joshua B.

Newton-Type Methods for Inference in Higher-Order Markov Random Fields	Linear programming relaxations are central to MAP in- ference in discrete Markov Random Fields. The ability to properly solve the Lagrangian dual is a critical component of such methods. In this paper, we study the benefit of us- ing Newton-type methods to solve the Lagrangian dual of a smooth version of the problem. We investigate their abil- ity to achieve superior convergence behavior and to bet- ter handle the ill-conditioned nature of the formulation, as compared to first order methods. We show that it is indeed possible to efficiently apply a trust region Newton method for a broad range of MAP inference problems. In this pa- per we propose a provably globally efficient framework that includes (i) excellent compromise between computational complexity and precision concerning the Hessian matrix construction, (ii) a damping strategy that aids efficient opti- mization, (iii) a truncation strategy coupled with a generic pre-conditioner for Conjugate Gradients, (iv) efficient sum- product computation for sparse clique potentials. Results for higher-order Markov Random Fields demonstrate the potential of this approach.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kannan_Newton-Type_Methods_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hariprasad Kannan, Nikos Komodakis, Nikos Paragios
Noise Robust Depth From Focus Using a Ring Difference Filter	"Depth from focus (DfF) is a method of estimating depth of a scene by using the information acquired through the change of the focus of a camera. Within the framework of DfF, the focus measure (FM) forms the foundation on which the accuracy of the output is determined. With the result from the FM, the role of a DfF pipeline is to determine and recalculate unreliable measurements while enhancing those that are reliable. In this paper, we propose a new FM that more accurately and robustly measures focus, which we call the ""ring difference filter"" (RDF). FMs can usually be categorized as confident local methods or noise robust non-local methods. RDF's unique ring-and-disk structure allows it to have the advantageous sides of both local and non-local FMs. We then describe an efficient pipeline that utilizes the properties that the RDF brings. Our method is able to reproduce results that are on par with or even better than those of the state-of-the-art, while spending less time in computation."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Surh_Noise_Robust_Depth_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jaeheung Surh, Hae-Gon Jeon, Yunwon Park, Sunghoon Im, Hyowon Ha, In So Kweon
Noise-Blind Image Deblurring	We present a novel approach to noise-blind deblurring, the problem of deblurring an image with known blur, but unknown noise level. We introduce an efficient and robust solution based on a Bayesian framework using a smooth generalization of the 0-1 loss. A novel bound allows the calculation of very high-dimensional integrals in closed form. It avoids the degeneracy of Maximum a-Posteriori (MAP) estimates and leads to an effective noise-adaptive scheme. Moreover, we drastically accelerate our algorithm by using Majorization Minimization (MM) without introducing any approximation or boundary artifacts. We further speed up convergence by turning our algorithm into a neural network termed GradNet, which is highly parallelizable and can be efficiently trained. We demonstrate that our noise-blind formulation can be integrated with different priors and significantly improves existing deblurring algorithms in the noise-blind and in the known-noise case. Furthermore, GradNet leads to state-of-the-art performance across different noise levels, while retaining high computational efficiency.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Jin_Noise-Blind_Image_Deblurring_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Meiguang Jin, Stefan Roth, Paolo Favaro
Noisy Softmax: Improving the Generalization Ability of DCNN via Postponing the Early Softmax Saturation	Over the past few years, softmax and SGD have become a commonly used component and the default training strategy in CNN frameworks, respectively. However, when optimizing CNNs with SGD, the saturation behavior behind softmax always gives us an illusion of training well and then is omitted. In this paper, we first emphasize that the early saturation behavior of softmax will impede the exploration of SGD, which sometimes is a reason for model converging at a bad local-minima, then propose Noisy Softmax to mitigating this early saturation issue by injecting annealed noise in softmax during each iteration. This operation based on noise injection aims at postponing the early saturation and further bringing continuous gradients propagation so as to significantly encourage SGD solver to be more exploratory and help to find a better local-minima. This paper empirically verifies the superiority of the early softmax desaturation, and our method indeed improves the generalization ability of CNN model by regularization. We experimentally find that this early desaturation helps optimization in many tasks, yielding state-of-the-art or competitive results on several popular benchmark datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chen_Noisy_Softmax_Improving_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Binghui Chen, Weihong Deng, Junping Du
Non-Contact Full Field Vibration Measurement Based on Phase-Shifting	Vibration measurement systems are widely used in the industry. A variety of vibration measurement techniques are proposed, including methods using an acceleration sensor, a laser displacement meter, and tracking a marker using a camera. However, these methods have limitations that allow only one point to be measured and require markers. We present a novel, non-contact full field joint measurement technique both of vibrations and shape based on phase-shifting. Our key idea is to acquire the frequency of vibrating objects using FFT to analyze the phase-shift error of vibrating objects. Our proposed algorithm estimates the phase-shift error by iterating frame-to-frame optimization and pixel-to-pixel optimization. A feature of our approach is to measure the surface of vibrating at different frequencies without markers or texture in full fields. Our developed system is a low cost system, which is composed of a digital-light-processing (DLP) projector and camera (100 frames per second). The results of our experiments show that low frequency vibration of objects can be measured with high accuracy in non-contact. Also, reconstruction of the vibrating object surface can be performed with high accuracy.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kayaba_Non-Contact_Full_Field_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hiroyuki Kayaba, Yuji Kokumai
Non-Local Color Image Denoising With Convolutional Neural Networks	We propose a novel deep network architecture for grayscale and color image denoising that is based on a non-local image model. Our motivation for the overall design of the proposed network stems from variational methods that exploit the inherent non-local self-similarity property of natural images. We build on this concept and introduce deep networks that perform non-local processing and at the same time they significantly benefit from discriminative learning. Experiments on the Berkeley segmentation dataset, comparing several state-of-the-art methods, show that the proposed non-local models achieve the best reported denoising performance both for grayscale and color images for all the tested noise levels. It is also worth noting that this increase in performance comes at no extra cost on the capacity of the network compared to existing alternative deep network architectures. In addition, we highlight a direct link of the proposed non-local models to convolutional neural networks. This connection is of significant importance since it allows our models to take full advantage of the latest advances on GPU computing in deep learning and makes them amenable to efficient implementations through their inherent parallelism.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lefkimmiatis_Non-Local_Color_Image_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Stamatios Lefkimmiatis
Non-Local Deep Features for Salient Object Detection	Saliency detection aims to highlight the most relevant objects in an image. Methods using conventional models struggle whenever salient objects are pictured on top of a cluttered background while deep neural nets suffer from excess complexity and slow evaluation speeds. In this paper, we propose a simplified convolutional neural network which combines local and global information through a multi-resolution 4x5 grid structure. Instead of enforcing spacial coherence with a CRF or superpixels as is usually the case, we implemented a loss function inspired by the Mumford-Shah functional which penalizes errors on the boundary. We trained our model on the MSRA-B dataset, and tested it on six different saliency benchmark datasets. Results show that our method is on par with the state-of-the-art while reducing computation time by a factor of 18 to 100 times, enabling near real-time, high performance saliency detection.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Luo_Non-Local_Deep_Features_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhiming Luo, Akshaya Mishra, Andrew Achkar, Justin Eichel, Shaozi Li, Pierre-Marc Jodoin
Non-Uniform Subset Selection for Active Learning in Structured Data	Several works have shown that relationships between data points (i.e., context) in structured data can be exploited to obtain better recognition performance. In this paper, we explore a different, but related, problem: how can these inter-relationships be used to efficiently learn and continuously update a recognition model, with minimal human labeling effort. Towards this goal, we propose an active learning framework to select an optimal subset of data points for manual labeling by exploiting the relationships between them. We construct a graph from the unlabeled data to represent the underlying structure, such that each node represents a data point, and edges represent the inter-relationships between them. Thereafter, considering the flow of beliefs in this graph, we choose those samples for labeling which minimize the joint entropy of the nodes of the graph. This results in significant reduction in manual labeling effort without compromising recognition performance. Our method chooses non-uniform number of samples from each batch of streaming data depending on its information content. Also, the submodular property of our objective function makes it computationally efficient to optimize. The proposed framework is demonstrated in various applications, including document analysis, scene-object recognition, and activity recognition.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Paul_Non-Uniform_Subset_Selection_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Sujoy Paul, Jawadul H.

Nonnegative Matrix Underapproximation for Robust Multiple Model Fitting	In this work, we introduce a highly efficient algorithm to address the nonnegative matrix underapproximation (NMU) problem, i.e., nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with an additional underapproximation constraint. NMU results are interesting as, compared to traditional NMF, they present additional sparsity and part-based behavior, explaining unique data features. To show these features in practice, we first present an application to the analysis of climate data. We then present an NMU-based algorithm to robustly fit multiple parametric models to a dataset. The proposed approach delivers state-of-the-art results for the estimation of multiple fundamental matrices and homographies, outperforming other alternatives in the literature and exemplifying the use of efficient NMU computations.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tepper_Nonnegative_Matrix_Underapproximation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mariano Tepper, Guillermo Sapiro
Nonrigid Registration of Hyperspectral and Color Images With Vastly Different Spatial and Spectral Resolutions for Spectral Unmixing and Pansharpening	In this paper, we propose a framework to register images with very large scale differences by utilizing the point spread function (PSF), and apply it to register hyperspectral and hi-resolution color images. The algorithm minimizes a least-squares (LSQ) objective function with an incorporated spectral response function (SRF), a nonrigid freeform deformation applied on the hyperspectral image and a rigid transformation on the color image. The optimization problem is solved by updating the two transformations and the two physical functions in an alternating fashion. We executed the framework on a simulated Pavia University dataset and a real Salton Sea dataset, by comparing the proposed algorithm with its rigid variation, and two mutual information-based algorithms. The results indicate that the LSQ freeform version has the best performance for the nonrigid simulation and real datasets, with less than 0.15 pixel error given 1 pixel nonrigid distortion in the hyperspectral domain.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w18/html/Zhou_Nonrigid_Registration_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yuan Zhou, Anand Rangarajan, Paul D.

Not Afraid of the Dark: NIR-VIS Face Recognition via Cross-Spectral Hallucination and Low-Rank Embedding	Surveillance cameras today often capture NIR (near infrared) images in low-light environments. However, most face datasets accessible for training and verification are only collected in the VIS (visible light) spectrum. It remains a challenging problem to match NIR to VIS face images due to the different light spectrum. Recently, breakthroughs have been made for VIS face recognition by applying deep learning on a huge amount of labeled VIS face samples. The same deep learning approach cannot be simply applied to NIR face recognition for two main reasons: First, much limited NIR face images are available for training compared to the VIS spectrum. Second, face galleries to be matched are mostly available only in the VIS spectrum. In this paper, we propose an approach to extend the deep learning breakthrough for VIS face recognition to the NIR spectrum, without retraining the underlying deep models that see only VIS faces. Our approach consists of two core components, cross-spectral hallucination and low-rank embedding, to optimize respectively input and output of a VIS deep model for cross-spectral face recognition. Cross-spectral hallucination produces VIS faces from NIR images through a deep learning approach. Low-rank embedding restores a low-rank structure for faces deep features across both NIR and VIS spectrum. We observe that it is often equally effective to perform hallucination to input NIR images or low-rank embedding to output deep features for a VIS deep model for cross-spectral recognition. When hallucination and low-rank embedding are deployed together, we observe significant further improvement; we obtain state-of-the-art accuracy on the CASIA NIR-VIS v2.0 benchmark, without the need at all to re-train the recognition system.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lezama_Not_Afraid_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jose Lezama, Qiang Qiu, Guillermo Sapiro
Not All Pixels Are Equal: Difficulty-Aware Semantic Segmentation via Deep Layer Cascade	We propose a novel deep layer cascade (LC) method to improve the accuracy and speed of semantic segmentation. Unlike the conventional model cascade (MC) that is composed of multiple independent models, LC treats a single deep model as a cascade of several sub-models. Earlier sub-models are trained to handle easy and confident regions, and they progressively feed-forward harder regions to the next sub-model for processing. Convolutions are only calculated on these regions to reduce computations. The proposed method possesses several advantages. First, LC classifies most of the easy regions in the shallow stage and makes deeper stage focuses on a few hard regions. Such an adaptive and 'difficulty-aware' learning improves segmentation performance. Second, LC accelerates both training and testing of deep network thanks to early decisions in the shallow stage. Third, in comparison to MC, LC is an end-to-end trainable framework, allowing joint learning of all sub-models. We evaluate our method on PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance and fast speed.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Li_Not_All_Pixels_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xiaoxiao Li, Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Chen Change Loy, Xiaoou Tang
Nuclei Segmentation of Fluorescence Microscopy Images Using Three Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks	Fluorescence microscopy enables one to visualize subcellular structures of living tissue or cells in three dimensions. This is especially true for two-photon microscopy using near-infrared light which can image deeper into tissue. To characterize and analyze biological structures, nuclei segmentation is a prerequisite step. Due to the complexity and size of the image data sets, manual segmentation is prohibitive. This paper describes a fully 3D nuclei segmentation method using three dimensional convolutional neural networks. To train the network, synthetic volumes with corresponding labeled volumes are automatically generated. Our results from multiple data sets demonstrate that our method can successfully segment nuclei in 3D.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w8/html/Ho_Nuclei_Segmentation_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	David Joon Ho, Chichen Fu, Paul Salama, Kenneth W.

Object Co-Skeletonization With Co-Segmentation	Recent advances in the joint processing of images have certainly shown its advantages over the individual processing. Different from the existing works geared towards co-segmentation or co-localization, in this paper, we explore a new joint processing topic: co-skeletonization, which is defined as joint skeleton extraction of common objects in a set of semantically similar images. Object skeletonization in real world images is a challenging problem, because there is no prior knowledge of the object's shape if we consider only a single image. This motivates us to resort to the idea of object co-skeletonization hoping that the commonness prior existing across the similar images may help, just as it does for other joint processing problems such as co-segmentation. Noting that skeleton can provide good scribbles for segmentation, and skeletonization, in turn, needs good segmentation, we propose a coupled framework for co-skeletonization and co-segmentation tasks so that they are well informed by each other, and benefit each other synergistically. Since it is a new problem, we also construct a benchmark dataset for the co-skeletonization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that proposed method achieves very competitive results.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Jerripothula_Object_Co-Skeletonization_With_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Koteswar Rao Jerripothula, Jianfei Cai, Jiangbo Lu, Junsong Yuan
Object Detection in Videos With Tubelet Proposal Networks	Object detection in videos has drawn increasing attention recently with the introduction of the large-scale ImageNet VID dataset. Different from object detection in static images, temporal information in videos is vital for object detection. To fully utilize temporal information, state-of-the-art methods are based on spatiotemporal tubelets, which are essentially sequences of associated bounding boxes across time. However, the existing methods have major limitations in generating tubelets in terms of quality and efficiency. Motion-based methods are able to obtain dense tubelets efficiently, but the lengths are generally only several frames, which is not optimal for incorporating long-term temporal information. Appearance-based methods, usually involving generic object tracking, could generate long tubelets, but are usually computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a framework for object detection in videos, which consists of a novel tubelet proposal network to efficiently generate spatiotemporal proposals, and a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) network that incorporates temporal information from tubelet proposals for achieving high object detection accuracy in videos. Experiments on the large-scale ImageNet VID dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for object detection in videos.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kang_Object_Detection_in_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Kai Kang, Hongsheng Li, Tong Xiao, Wanli Ouyang, Junjie Yan, Xihui Liu, Xiaogang Wang
Object Region Mining With Adversarial Erasing: A Simple Classification to Semantic Segmentation Approach	We investigate a principle way to progressively mine discriminative object regions using classification networks to address the weakly-supervised semantic segmentation problems. Classification networks are only responsive to small and sparse discriminative regions from the object of interest, which deviates from the requirement of the segmentation task that needs to localize dense, interior and integral regions for pixel-wise inference. To mitigate this gap, we propose a new adversarial erasing approach for localizing and expanding object regions progressively. Starting with a single small object region, our proposed approach drives the classification network to sequentially discover new and complement object regions by erasing the current mined regions in an adversarial manner. These localized regions eventually constitute a dense and complete object region for learning semantic segmentation. To further enhance the quality of the discovered regions by adversarial erasing, an online prohibitive segmentation learning approach is developed to collaborate with adversarial erasing by providing auxiliary segmentation supervision modulated by the more reliable classification scores. Despite its apparent simplicity, the proposed approach achieves 55.0% and 55.7% mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) scores on PASCAL VOC 2012 val and test sets, which are the new state-of-the-arts.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wei_Object_Region_Mining_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yunchao Wei, Jiashi Feng, Xiaodan Liang, Ming-Ming Cheng, Yao Zhao, Shuicheng Yan

Correct handling is crucial in both manufacturing and maintenance industries and deviations may cause problems in later stages of the production and assembly. The primary aim of such support systems is making the training of new employees faster and more efficient and reducing the error rate.

Object-Aware Dense Semantic Correspondence	"This work aims to build pixel-to-pixel correspondences between images from the same visual class but with different geometries and visual similarities. This task is particularly challenging because (i) their visual content is similar only on the high-level structure, and (ii) background clutters keep bringing in noises. To address these problems, this paper proposes an object-aware method to estimate per-pixel correspondences from semantic to low-level by learning a classifier for each selected discriminative grid cell and guiding the localization of every pixel under the semantic constraint. Specifically, an Object-aware Hierarchical Graph (OHG) model is constructed to regulate matching consistency from one coarse grid cell containing whole object(s), to fine grid cells covering smaller semantic elements, and finally to every pixel. A guidance layer is introduced as the semantic constraint on local structure matching. In addition, we propose to learn the important high-level structure for each grid cell in an ""objectness-driven"" way as an alternative to handcrafted descriptors in defining a better visual similarity. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on various challenging benchmarks and real-world images. The results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts in terms of semantic flow accuracy."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yang_Object-Aware_Dense_Semantic_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Fan Yang, Xin Li, Hong Cheng, Jianping Li, Leiting Chen
OctNet: Learning Deep 3D Representations at High Resolutions	We present OctNet, a representation for deep learning with sparse 3D data. In contrast to existing models, our representation enables 3D convolutional networks which are both deep and high resolution. Towards this goal, we exploit the sparsity in the input data to hierarchically partition the space using a set of unbalanced octrees where each leaf node stores a pooled feature representation. This allows to focus memory allocation and computation to the relevant dense regions and enables deeper networks without compromising resolution. We demonstrate the utility of our OctNet representation by analyzing the impact of resolution on several 3D tasks including 3D object classification, orientation estimation and point cloud labeling.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Riegler_OctNet_Learning_Deep_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Gernot Riegler, Ali Osman Ulusoy, Andreas Geiger

On Compressing Deep Models by Low Rank and Sparse Decomposition	"Deep compression refers to removing the redundancy of parameters and feature maps for deep learning models. Low-rank approximation and pruning for sparse structures play a vital role in many compression works. However, weight filters tend to be both low-rank and sparse. Neglecting either part of these structure information in previous methods results in iteratively retraining, compromising accuracy, and low compression rates. Here we propose a unified framework integrating the low-rank and sparse decomposition of weight matrices with the feature map reconstructions. Our model includes methods like pruning connections as special cases, and is optimized by a fast SVD-free algorithm. It has been theoretically proven that, with a small sample, due to its generalizability, our model can well reconstruct the feature maps on both training and test data, which results in less compromising accuracy prior to the subsequent retraining. With such a ""warm start"" to retrain, the compression method always possesses several merits: (a) higher compression rates, (b) little loss of accuracy, and (c) fewer rounds to compress deep models. The experimental results on several popular models such as AlexNet, VGG-16, and GoogLeNet show that our model can significantly reduce the parameters for both convolutional and fully-connected layers. As a result, our model reduces the size of VGG-16 by 15x, better than other recent compression methods that use a single strategy."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yu_On_Compressing_Deep_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xiyu Yu, Tongliang Liu, Xinchao Wang, Dacheng Tao
On Human Motion Prediction Using Recurrent Neural Networks	Human motion modelling is a classical problem at the intersection of graphics and computer vision, with applications spanning human-computer interaction, motion synthesis, and motion prediction for virtual and augmented reality. Following the success of deep learning methods in several computer vision tasks, recent work has focused on using deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model human motion, with the goal of learning time-dependent representations that perform tasks such as short-term motion prediction and long-term human motion synthesis. We examine recent work, with a focus on the evaluation methodologies commonly used in the literature, and show that, surprisingly, state of the art performance can be achieved by a simple baseline that does not attempt to model motion at all. We investigate this result, and analyze recent RNN methods by looking at the architectures, loss functions, and training procedures used in state-of-the-art approaches. We propose three changes to the standard RNN models typically used for human motion, which results in a simple and scalable RNN architecture that obtains state-of-the-art performance on human motion prediction.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Martinez_On_Human_Motion_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Julieta Martinez, Michael J.

On the Effectiveness of Visible Watermarks	"Visible watermarking is a widely-used technique for marking and protecting copyrights of many millions of images on the web, yet it suffers from an inherent security flaw---watermarks are typically added in a consistent manner to many images. We show that this consistency allows to automatically estimate the watermark and recover the original images with high accuracy. Specifically, we present a generalized multi-image matting algorithm that takes a watermarked image collection as input and automatically estimates the ""foreground"" (watermark), its alpha matte, and the ""background"" (original) images. Since such an attack relies on the consistency of watermarks across image collection, we explore and evaluate how it is affected by various types of inconsistencies in the watermark embedding that could potentially be used to make watermarking more secured. We demonstrate the algorithm on stock imagery available on the web, and provide extensive quantitative analysis on synthetic watermarked data. A key takeaway message of this paper is that visible watermarks should be designed to not only be robust against removal from a single image, but to be more resistant to mass-scale removal from image collections as well."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Dekel_On_the_Effectiveness_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tali Dekel, Michael Rubinstein, Ce Liu, William T.

On the Global Geometry of Sphere-Constrained Sparse Blind Deconvolution	Blind deconvolution is the problem of recovering a convolutional kernel and an activation signal from their convolution. This problem is ill-posed without further constraints or priors. This paper studies the situation where the nonzero entries in the activation signal are sparsely and randomly populated.. We normalize the convolution kernel to have unit Frobenius norm and cast the sparse blind deconvolution problem as a nonconvex optimization problem over the sphere. With this spherical constraint, every spurious local minimum turns out to be close to some signed shift truncation of the ground truth, under certain hypotheses. This benign property motivates an effective two stage algorithm that recovers the ground truth from the partial information offered by a suboptimal local minimum. This geometry-inspired algorithm recovers the ground truth for certain microscopy problems, also exhibits promising performance in the more challenging image deblurring problem. Our insights into the global geometry and the two stage algorithm extend to the convolutional dictionary learning problem, where a superposition of multiple convolution signals is observed.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_On_the_Global_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yuqian Zhang, Yenson Lau, Han-wen Kuo, Sky Cheung, Abhay Pasupathy, John Wright
On the Role of Representations for Reasoning in Large-Scale Urban Scenes	The advent of widely available photo collections covering broad geographic areas has spurred significant advances in large-scale urban scene modeling. While much emphasis has been placed on reconstruction and visualization, the utility of such models extends well beyond. Specifically, these models should support a wide variety of reasoning tasks (or queries), and thus enable advanced scene study. Driven by this interest, we analyze 3D representations for their utility to perform queries. Since representations as well as queries are highly heterogeneous, we build on a categorization that serves as a coupling interface between both domains. Equipped with our taxonomy and the notion of uncertainty in the representation, we quantify the utility of representations for solving three archetypal reasoning tasks in terms of accuracy, uncertainty and computational complexity. We provide an empirical analysis of these intertwined realms on challenging real and synthetic urban scenes.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w18/html/Cabezas_On_the_Role_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Randi Cabezas, Maros Blaha, Sue Zheng, Guy Rosman, Konrad Schindler, John W.

On the Two-View Geometry of Unsynchronized Cameras	We present new methods of simultaneously estimating camera geometry and time shift from video sequences from multiple unsynchronized cameras. Algorithms for simultaneous computation of a fundamental matrix or a homography with unknown time shift between images are developed. Our methods use minimal correspondence sets (eight for fundamental matrix and four and a half for homography) and therefore are suitable for robust estimation using RANSAC. Furthermore, we present an iterative algorithm that extends the applicability on sequences which are significantly unsynchronized, finding the correct time shift up to several seconds. We evaluated the methods on synthetic and wide range of real world datasets and the results show a broad applicability to the problem of camera synchronization.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Albl_On_the_Two-View_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Cenek Albl, Zuzana Kukelova, Andrew Fitzgibbon, Jan Heller, Matej Smid, Tomas Pajdla
On-The-Fly Adaptation of Regression Forests for Online Camera Relocalisation	Camera relocalisation is an important problem in computer vision, with applications in simultaneous localisation and mapping, virtual/augmented reality and navigation. Common techniques either match the current image against keyframes with known poses coming from a tracker, or establish 2D-to-3D correspondences between keypoints in the current image and points in the scene in order to estimate the camera pose. Recently, regression forests have become a popular alternative to establish such correspondences. They achieve accurate results, but must be trained offline on the target scene, preventing relocalisation in new environments. In this paper, we show how to circumvent this limitation by adapting a pre-trained forest to a new scene on the fly. Our adapted forests achieve relocalisation performance that is on par with that of offline forests, and our approach runs in under 150ms, making it desirable for real-time systems that require online relocalisation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Cavallari_On-The-Fly_Adaptation_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tommaso Cavallari, Stuart Golodetz, Nicholas A.

One-Shot Hyperspectral Imaging Using Faced Reflectors	Hyperspectral imaging is a useful technique for various computer vision tasks such as material recognition. However, such technique usually requires an expensive and professional setup and is time-consuming because a conventional hyperspectral image consists of a large number of observations. In this paper, we propose a novel technique of one-shot hyperspectral imaging using faced reflectors on which color filters are attached. The key idea is based on the principle that each of multiple reflections on the filters has a different spectrum, which allows us to observe multiple intensities through different spectra. Our technique can be implemented either by a coupled mirror or a kaleidoscope geometry. Experimental results show that our technique is capable of accurately capturing a hyperspectral image by using a coupled mirror setup which is readily available.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Takatani_One-Shot_Hyperspectral_Imaging_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tsuyoshi Takatani, Takahito Aoto, Yasuhiro Mukaigawa
One-Shot Metric Learning for Person Re-Identification	Re-identification of people in surveillance footage must cope with drastic variations in color, background, viewing angle and a person's pose. Supervised techniques are often the most effective, but require extensive annotation which is infeasible for large camera networks. Unlike previous supervised learning approaches that require hundreds of annotated subjects, we learn a metric using a novel one-shot learning approach. We first learn a deep texture representation from intensity images with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). When training a CNN using only intensity images, the learned embedding is color-invariant and shows high performance even on unseen datasets without fine-tuning. To account for differences in camera color distributions, we learn a color metric using a single pair of ColorChecker images. The proposed one-shot learning achieves performance that is competitive with supervised methods, but uses only a single example rather than the hundreds required for the fully supervised case. Compared with semi-supervised and unsupervised state-of-the-art methods, our approach yields significantly higher accuracy.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Bak_One-Shot_Metric_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Slawomir Bak, Peter Carr
One-Shot Video Object Segmentation	This paper tackles the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation, i.e., the separation of an object from the background in a video, given the mask of the first frame. We present One-Shot Video Object Segmentation (OSVOS), based on a fully-convolutional neural network architecture that is able to successively transfer generic semantic information, learned on ImageNet, to the task of foreground segmentation, and finally to learning the appearance of a single annotated object of the test sequence (hence one-shot). Although all frames are processed independently, the results are temporally coherent and stable. We perform experiments on two annotated video segmentation databases, which show that OSVOS is fast and improves the state of the art by a significant margin (79.8% vs 68.0%).	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Caelles_One-Shot_Video_Object_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Sergi Caelles, Kevis-Kokitsi Maninis, Jordi Pont-Tuset, Laura Leal-Taixe, Daniel Cremers, Luc Van Gool
One-To-Many Network for Visually Pleasing Compression Artifacts Reduction	"We consider the compression artifacts reduction problem, where a compressed image is transformed into an artifact-free image. Recent approaches for this problem typically train a one-to-one mapping using a per-pixel L_2 loss between the outputs and the ground-truths. We point out that these approaches used to produce overly smooth results, and PSNR doesn't reflect their real performance. In this paper, we propose a one-to-many network, which measures output quality using a perceptual loss, a naturalness loss, and a JPEG loss. We also avoid grid-like artifacts during deconvolution using a ""shift-and-average"" strategy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the dramatic visual improvement of our approach over the state of the arts."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Guo_One-To-Many_Network_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jun Guo, Hongyang Chao
Online Asymmetric Similarity Learning for Cross-Modal Retrieval	Cross-modal retrieval has attracted intensive attention in recent years. Measuring the semantic similarity between heterogeneous data objects is an essential yet challenging problem in cross-modal retrieval. In this paper, we propose an online learning method to learn the similarity function between heterogeneous modalities by preserving the relative similarity in the training data, which is modeled as a set of bi-directional hinge loss constraints on the cross-modal training triplets. The overall online similarity function learning problem is optimized by the margin based Passive-Aggressive algorithm. We further extend the approach to learn similarity function in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces by kernelizing the approach and combining multiple kernels derived from different layers of the CNN features using the Hedging algorithm. Theoretical mistake bounds are given for our methods. Experiments conducted on real world datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wu_Online_Asymmetric_Similarity_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yiling Wu, Shuhui Wang, Qingming Huang
Online Graph Completion: Multivariate Signal Recovery in Computer Vision	"The adoption of ""human-in-the-loop"" paradigms in computer vision and machine learning is leading to various applications where the actual data acquisition (e.g., human supervision) and the underlying inference algorithms are closely interwined. While classical work in active learning provides effective solutions when the learning module involves classification and regression tasks, many practical issues such as partially observed measurements, financial constraints and even additional distributional or structural aspects of the data typically fall outside the scope of this treatment. For instance, with sequential acquisition of partial measurements of data that manifest as a matrix (or tensor), novel strategies for completion (or collaborative filtering) of the remaining entries have only been studied recently. Motivated by vision problems where we seek to annotate a large dataset of images via a crowdsourced platform or alternatively, complement results from a state-of-the-art object detector using human feedback, we study the ""completion"" problem defined on graphs, where requests for additional measurements must be made sequentially. We design the optimization model in the Fourier domain of the graph describing how ideas based on adaptive submodularity provide algorithms that work well in practice. On a large set of images collected from Imgur, we see promising results on images that are otherwise difficult to categorize. We also show applications to an experimental design problem in neuroimaging."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kim_Online_Graph_Completion_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Won Hwa Kim, Mona Jalal, Seongjae Hwang, Sterling C.

Online Summarization via Submodular and Convex Optimization	We consider the problem of subset selection in the online setting, where data arrive incrementally. Instead of storing and running subset selection on the entire dataset, we propose an incremental subset selection framework that, at each time instant, uses the previously selected set of representatives and the new batch of data in order to update the set of representatives. We cast the problem as an integer binary optimization minimizing the encoding cost of the data via representatives regularized by the number of selected items. As the proposed optimization is, in general, NP-hard and non-convex, we study a greedy approach based on unconstrained submodular optimization and also propose an efficient convex relaxation. We show that, under appropriate conditions, the solution of our proposed convex algorithm achieves the global optimal solution of the non-convex problem. Our results also address the conventional problem of subset selection in the offline setting, as a special case. By extensive experiments on the problem of video summarization, we demonstrate that our proposed online subset selection algorithms perform well on real data, capturing diverse representative events in videos, while they obtain objective function values close to the offline setting.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Elhamifar_Online_Summarization_via_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ehsan Elhamifar, M.

Online Video Object Segmentation via Convolutional Trident Network	A semi-supervised online video object segmentation algorithm, which accepts user annotations about a target object at the first frame, is proposed in this work. We propagate the segmentation labels at the previous frame to the current frame using optical flow vectors. However, the propagation is error-prone. Therefore, we develop the convolutional trident network (CTN), which has three decoding branches: separative, definite foreground, and definite background decoders. Then, we perform Markov random field optimization based on outputs of the three decoders. We sequentially carry out these processes from the second to the last frames to extract a segment track of the target object. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art conventional algorithms on the DAVIS benchmark dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Jang_Online_Video_Object_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Won-Dong Jang, Chang-Su Kim
Optical Acceleration for Motion Description in Videos	Modern techniques for describing motion in videos are centred around velocity descriptors based on optical flow. Realizing that acceleration is as important as velocity for describing motion information, in this paper first we propose two different algorithms to compute optical acceleration. Delving deeper into the concept of optical acceleration, we use two descriptors: histogram of optical acceleration (HOA) and histogram of spatial gradient of acceleration (HSGA), to effectively encode the motion information. To assess the effectiveness of these descriptors for motion encoding, we applied it for human action recognition and abnormal event detection in videos. In fact, we used acceleration descriptors in conjunction with velocity descriptors to get a better description of motion in videos. Our experiments reveal that acceleration descriptors could provide additional information that velocity descriptors missed and hence combining them results in a superior motion descriptor.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w20/html/Edison_Optical_Acceleration_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Anitha Edison, Jiji C.

Optical Flow Estimation Using a Spatial Pyramid Network	We learn to compute optical flow by combining a classical spatial-pyramid formulation with deep learning. This estimates large motions in a coarse-to-fine approach by warping one image of a pair at each pyramid level by the current flow estimate and computing an update to the flow. Instead of the standard minimization of an objective function at each pyramid level, we train one deep network per level to compute the flow update. Unlike the recent FlowNet approach, the networks do not need to deal with large motions; these are dealt with by the pyramid. This has several advantages. First, our Spatial Pyramid Network (SPyNet) is much simpler and 96% smaller than FlowNet in terms of model parameters. This makes it more efficient and appropriate for embedded applications. Second, since the flow at each pyramid level is small ( < 1 pixel), a convolutional approach applied to pairs of warped images is appropriate. Third, unlike FlowNet, the learned convolution filters appear similar to classical spatio-temporal filters, giving insight into the method and how to improve it. Our results are more accurate than FlowNet on most standard benchmarks, suggesting a new direction of combining classical flow methods with deep learning.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ranjan_Optical_Flow_Estimation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Anurag Ranjan, Michael J.

Optical Flow Requires Multiple Strategies (but Only One Network)	We show that the matching problem that underlies optical flow requires multiple strategies, depending on the amount of image motion and other factors. We then study the implications of this observation on training a deep neural network for representing image patches in the context of descriptor based optical flow. We propose a metric learning method, which selects suitable negative samples based on the nature of the true match. This type of training produces a network that displays multiple strategies depending on the input and leads to state of the art results on the KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015 optical flow benchmarks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Schuster_Optical_Flow_Requires_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tal Schuster, Lior Wolf, David Gadot
Optical Flow in Mostly Rigid Scenes	The optical flow of natural scenes is a combination of the motion of the observer and the independent motion of objects. Existing algorithms typically focus on either recovering motion and structure under the assumption of a purely static world or optical flow for general unconstrained scenes. We combine these approaches in an optical flow algorithm that estimates an explicit segmentation of moving objects from appearance and physical constraints. In static regions we take advantage of strong constraints to jointly estimate the camera motion and the 3D structure of the scene over multiple frames. This allows us to also regularize the structure instead of the motion. Our formulation uses a Plane+Parallax framework, which works even under small baselines, and reduces the motion estimation to a one-dimensional search problem, resulting in more accurate estimation. In moving regions the flow is treated as unconstrained, and computed with an existing optical flow method. The resulting Mostly-Rigid Flow (MR-Flow) method achieves state-of-the-art results on both the MPI-Sintel and KITTI-2015 benchmarks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wulff_Optical_Flow_in_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jonas Wulff, Laura Sevilla-Lara, Michael J.

Optimizing the Lens Selection Process for Multi-Focus Plenoptic Cameras and Numerical Evaluation	The last years have seen a quick rise of digital photography. Plenoptic cameras provide extended capabilities with respect to previous models. Multi-focus cameras enlarge the depth-of-field of the pictures using different focal lengths in the lens composing the array, but questions still arise on how to select and use these lenses. In this work a further insight on the lens selection was made, and a novel method was developed in order to choose the best available lens combination for the disparity estimation. We test different lens combinations, ranking them based on the error and the number of different lenses used, creating a mapping function that relates the virtual depth with the combination that achieves the best result. The results are then organized in a look up table that can be tuned to trade off between performances and accuracy. This allows for fast and accurate lens selection. Moreover, new synthetic images with respective ground truth are provided, in order to confirm that this work performs better than the current state of the art in efficiency and accuracy of the results.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w27/html/Palmieri_Optimizing_the_Lens_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Luca Palmieri, Reinhard Koch
Order-Preserving Wasserstein Distance for Sequence Matching	We present a new distance measure between sequences that can tackle local temporal distortion and periodic sequences with arbitrary starting points. Through viewing the instances of sequences as empirical samples of an unknown distribution, we cast the calculation of the distance between sequences as the optimal transport problem. To preserve the inherent temporal relationships of the instances in sequences, we smooth the optimal transport problem with two novel temporal regularization terms. The inverse difference moment regularization enforces transport with local homogeneous structures, and the KL-divergence with a prior distribution regularization prevents transport between instances with far temporal positions. We show that this problem can be efficiently optimized through the matrix scaling algorithm. Extensive experiments on different datasets with different classifiers show that the proposed distance outperforms the traditional DTW variants and the smoothed optimal transport distance without temporal regularization.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Su_Order-Preserving_Wasserstein_Distance_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Bing Su, Gang Hua
Oriented Response Networks	Deep Convolution Neural Networks (DCNNs) are capable of learning unprecedentedly effective image representations. However, their ability in handling significant local and global image rotations remains limited. In this paper, we propose Active Rotating Filters (ARFs) that actively rotate during convolution and produce feature maps with location and orientation explicitly encoded. An ARF acts as a virtual filter bank containing the filter itself and its multiple unmaterialised rotated versions. During back-propagation, an ARF is collectively updated using errors from all its rotated versions. DCNNs using ARFs, referred to as Oriented Response Networks (ORNs), can produce within-class rotation-invariant deep features while maintaining inter-class discrimination for classification tasks. The oriented response produced by ORNs can also be used for image and object orientation estimation tasks. Over multiple state-of-the-art DCNN architectures, such as VGG, ResNet, and STN, we consistently observe that replacing regular filters with the proposed ARFs leads to significant reduction in the number of network parameters and improvement in classification performance. We report the best results on several commonly used benchmarks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhou_Oriented_Response_Networks_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yanzhao Zhou, Qixiang Ye, Qiang Qiu, Jianbin Jiao
Outlier-Robust Tensor PCA	Low-rank tensor analysis is important for various real applications in computer vision. However, existing methods focus on recovering a low-rank tensor contaminated by Gaussian or gross sparse noise and hence cannot effectively handle outliers that are common in practical tensor data. To solve this issue, we propose an outlier-robust tensor principle component analysis (OR-TPCA) method for simultaneous low-rank tensor recovery and outlier detection. For intrinsically low-rank tensor observations with arbitrary outlier corruption, OR-TPCA is the first method that has provable performance guarantee for exactly recovering the tensor subspace and detecting outliers under mild conditions. Since tensor data are naturally high-dimensional and multi-way, we further develop a fast randomized algorithm that requires small sampling size yet can substantially accelerate OR-TPCA without performance drop. Experimental results on four tasks: outlier detection, clustering, semi-supervised and supervised learning, clearly demonstrate the advantages of our method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhou_Outlier-Robust_Tensor_PCA_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Pan Zhou, Jiashi Feng

POSEidon: Face-From-Depth for Driver Pose Estimation	Fast and accurate upper-body and head pose estimation is a key task for automatic monitoring of driver attention, a challenging context characterized by severe illumination changes, occlusions and extreme poses. In this work, we present a new deep learning framework for head localization and pose estimation on depth images. The core of the proposal is a regressive neural network, called POSEidon, which is composed of three independent convolutional nets followed by a fusion layer, specially conceived for understanding the pose by depth. In addition, to recover the intrinsic value of face appearance for understanding head position and orientation, we propose a new Face-from-Depth model for learning image faces from depth. Results in face reconstruction are qualitatively impressive. We test the proposed framework on two public datasets, namely Biwi Kinect Head Pose and ICT-3DHP, and on Pandora, a new challenging dataset mainly inspired by the automotive setup. Results show that our method overcomes all recent state-of-art works, running in real time at more than 30 frames per second.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Borghi_POSEidon_Face-From-Depth_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Guido Borghi, Marco Venturelli, Roberto Vezzani, Rita Cucchiara
PaletteNet: Image Recolorization With Given Color Palette	Image recolorization enhances the visual perception of an image for design and artistic purposes. In this work, we present a deep neural network, referred to as PaletteNet, which recolors an image according to a given target color palette that is useful to express the color concept of an image. PaletteNet takes two inputs: a source image to be recolored and a target palette. PaletteNet is then designed to change the color concept of a source image so that the palette of the output image is close to the target palette. To train PaletteNet, the proposed multi-task loss is composed of Euclidean loss and adversarial loss. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing recolorization methods. Human experts with a commercial software take on average 18 minutes to recolor an image, while PaletteNet automatically recolors plausible results in less than a second.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w12/html/Cho_PaletteNet_Image_Recolorization_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Junho Cho, Sangdoo Yun, Kyoung Mu Lee, Jin Young Choi
Parametric T-Spline Face Morphable Model for Detailed Fitting in Shape Subspace	Pre-learnt subspace methods, e.g., 3DMMs, are significant exploration for the synthesis of 3D faces by assuming that faces are in a linear class. However, the human face is in a nonlinear manifold, and a new test are always not in the pre-learnt subspace accurately because of the disparity brought by ethnicity, age, gender, etc. In the paper, we propose a parametric T-spline morphable model (T-splineMM) for 3D face representation, which has great advantages of fitting data from an unknown source accurately. In the model, we describe a face by C^2 T-spline surface, and divide the face surface into several shape units (SUs), according to facial action coding system (FACS), on T-mesh instead of on the surface directly. A fitting algorithm is proposed to optimize coefficients of T-spline control point components along pre-learnt identity and expression subspaces, as well as to optimize the details in refinement progress. As any pre-learnt subspace is not complete to handle the variety and details of faces and expressions, it covers a limited span of morphing. SUs division and detail refinement make the model fitting the facial muscle deformation in a larger span of morphing subspace. We conduct experiments on face scan data, kinect data as well as the space-time data to test the performance of detail fitting, robustness to missing data and noise, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Convincing results are illustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model compared with the popular methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Peng_Parametric_T-Spline_Face_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Weilong Peng, Zhiyong Feng, Chao Xu, Yong Su
Parsimonious Coding and Verification of Offline Handwritten Signatures	A common practice for addressing the problem of verifying the presence, or the consent of a person in many transactions is to utilize the handwritten signature. Among others, the offline or static signature is a valuable tool in forensic related studies. Thus, the importance of verifying static handwritten signatures still poses a challenging task. Throughout the literature, gray-level images, composed of handwritten signature traces are subjected to numerous processing stages; their outcome is the mapping of any input signature image in a so-called corresponding feature space. Pattern recognition techniques utilize this feature space, usually as a binary verification problem. In this work, sparse dictionary learning and coding are for the first time employed as a means to provide a feature space for offline signature verification, which intuitively adapts to a small set of randomly selected genuine reference samples, thus making it attractable for forensic cases. In this context, the K-SVD dictionary learning algorithm is employed in order to create a writer oriented lexicon. For any signature sample, sparse representation with the use of the writer's lexicon and the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm generates a weight matrix; features are then extracted by applying simple average pooling to the generated sparse codes. The performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated using the popular CEDAR, MCYT75 and GPDS300 signature datasets, delivering state of the art results.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w6/html/Zois_Parsimonious_Coding_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Elias N.

Parsing Images of Overlapping Organisms With Deep Singling-Out Networks	"This work is motivated by the mostly unsolved task of parsing biological images with multiple overlapping articulated model organisms (such as worms or larvae). We present a general approach that separates the two main challenges associated with such data, individual object shape estimation and object groups disentangling. At the core of the approach is a deep feed-forward singling-out network (SON) that is trained to map each local patch to a vectorial descriptor that is sensitive to the characteristics (e.g. shape) of a central object, while being invariant to the variability of all other surrounding elements. Given a SON, a local image patch can be matched to a gallery of isolated elements using their SON-descriptors, thus producing a hypothesis about the shape of the central element in that patch. The image-level optimization based on integer programming can then pick a subset of the hypotheses to explain (parse) the whole image and disentangle groups of organisms. While sharing many similarities with existing ""analysis-by-synthesis"" approaches, our method avoids the need for stochastic search in the high-dimensional configuration space and numerous rendering operations at test-time. We show that our approach can parse microscopy images of three popular model organisms (the C.Elegans roundworms, the Drosophila larvae, and the E.Coli bacteria) even under significant crowding and overlaps between organisms. We speculate that the overall approach is applicable to a wider class of image parsing problems concerned with crowded articulated objects, for which rendering training images is possible."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yurchenko_Parsing_Images_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Victor Yurchenko, Victor Lempitsky
Perceptual Generative Adversarial Networks for Small Object Detection	Detecting small objects is notoriously challenging due to their low resolution and noisy representation. Existing object detection pipelines usually detect small objects through learning representations of all the objects at multiple scales. However, the performance gain of such ad hoc architectures is usually limited to pay off the computational cost. In this work, we address the small object detection problem by developing a single architecture that internally lifts representations of small objects to super-resolved ones, achieving similar characteristics as large objects and thus more discriminative for detection. For this purpose, we propose a new Perceptual Generative Adversarial Network (Perceptual GAN) model that improves small object detection through narrowing representation difference of small objects from the large ones. Specifically, its generator learns to transfer perceived poor representations of the small objects to super-resolved ones that are similar enough to real large objects to fool a competing discriminator. Meanwhile its discriminator competes with the generator to identify the generated representation and imposes an additional perceptual requirement - generated representations of small objects must be beneficial for detection purpose - on the generator. Extensive evaluations on the challenging Tsinghua-Tencent 100K and the Caltech benchmark well demonstrate the superiority of Perceptual GAN in detecting small objects, including traffic signs and pedestrians, over well-established state-of-the-arts.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Li_Perceptual_Generative_Adversarial_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jianan Li, Xiaodan Liang, Yunchao Wei, Tingfa Xu, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan
Person Re-Identification by Deep Learning Attribute-Complementary Information	Automatic person re-identification (re-id) across camera boundaries is a challenging problem. Approaches have to be robust against many factors which influence the visual appearance of a person but are not relevant to the person's identity. Examples for such factors are pose, camera angles, and lighting conditions. Person attributes are a semantic high level information which is invariant across many such influences and contain information which is often highly relevant to a person's identity. In this work we develop a re-id approach which leverages the information contained in automatically detected attributes. We train an attribute classifier on separate data and include its responses into the training process of our person re-id model which is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This allows us to learn a person representation which contains information complementary to that contained within the attributes. Our approach is able to identify attributes which perform most reliably for re-id and focus on them accordingly. We demonstrate the performance improvement gained through use of the attribute information on multiple large-scale datasets and report insights into which attributes are most relevant for person re-id.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w17/html/Schumann_Person_Re-Identification_by_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Arne Schumann, Rainer Stiefelhagen
Person Re-Identification for Improved Multi-Person Multi-Camera Tracking by Continuous Entity Association	We present a novel approach to person tracking within the context of entity association. In large-scale distributed multi-camera systems, person re-identification is a challenging computer vision task as the problem is two-fold: detecting entities through identification and recognition techniques; and connecting entities temporally by associating them in often crowded environments. Since tracking essentially involves linking detections, we can reformulate it purely as a re-identification task. The inherent advantage of such a reformulation lies in the ability of the tracking algorithm to effectively handle temporal discontinuities in multi-camera environments. To accomplish this, we model human appearance, face biometric and location constraints across cameras. We do not make restrictive assumptions such as number of people in a scene. Our approach is validated by using a simple and efficient inference algorithm. Results on two publicly available datasets, CamNeT and DukeMTMC, are significantly better compared to other existing methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w6/html/Narayan_Person_Re-Identification_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Neeti Narayan, Nishant Sankaran, Devansh Arpit, Karthik Dantu, Srirangaraj Setlur, Venu Govindaraju
Person Re-Identification in the Wild	This paper presents a novel large-scale dataset and comprehensive baselines for end-to-end pedestrian detection and person recognition in raw video frames. Our baselines address three issues: the performance of various combinations of detectors and recognizers, mechanisms for pedestrian detection to help improve overall re-identification (re-ID) accuracy and assessing the effectiveness of different detectors for re-ID. We make three distinct contributions. First, a new dataset, PRW, is introduced to evaluate Person Re-identification in the Wild, using videos acquired through six synchronized cameras. It contains 932 identities and 11,816 frames in which pedestrians are annotated with their bounding box positions and identities. Extensive benchmarking results are presented on this dataset. Second, we show that pedestrian detection aids re-ID through two simple yet effective improvements: a cascaded fine-tuning strategy that trains a detection model first and then the classification model, and a Confidence Weighted Similarity (CWS) metric that incorporates detection scores into similarity measurement. Third, we derive insights in evaluating detector performance for the particular scenario of accurate person re-ID.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zheng_Person_Re-Identification_in_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Liang Zheng, Hengheng Zhang, Shaoyan Sun, Manmohan Chandraker, Yi Yang, Qi Tian
Person Search With Natural Language Description	Searching persons in large-scale image databases with the query of natural language description has important applications in video surveillance. Existing methods mainly focused on searching persons with image-based or attribute-based queries, which have major limitations for a practical usage. In this paper, we study the problem of person search with natural language description. Given the textual description of a person, the algorithm of the person search is required to rank all the samples in the person database then retrieve the most relevant sample corresponding to the queried description. Since there is no person dataset or benchmark with textual description available, we collect a large-scale person description dataset with detailed natural language annotations and person samples from various sources, termed as CUHK Person Description Dataset (CUHK-PEDES). A wide range of possible models and baselines have been evaluated and compared on the person search benchmark. An Recurrent Neural Network with Gated Neural Attention mechanism (GNA-RNN) is proposed to establish the state-of-the art performance on person search.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Li_Person_Search_With_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shuang Li, Tong Xiao, Hongsheng Li, Bolei Zhou, Dayu Yue, Xiaogang Wang
Personality Traits and Job Candidate Screening via Analyzing Facial Videos	In this paper, we propose a novel approach for estimating the Big Five personality traits and the job candidate screening attribute through facial videos. At running time, the proposed system feeds the Pyramid Multi-Level (PML) texture features extracted from the whole video sequence to 5 Support Vector Regressors in order to estimate the personality traits. These estimated five scores are then considered as new input features to the interview score regressor. The latter is given by a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The experimental results on ChaLearn LAP APA2016 dataset achieve good performance. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the computational cost of both the training and the testing of the proposed framework are very competitive in terms of accuracy and computational cost.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w26/html/Bekhouche_Personality_Traits_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Salah Eddine Bekhouche, Fadi Dornaika, Abdelkrim Ouafi, Abdelmalik Taleb-Ahmed
Personalized Automatic Estimation of Self-Reported Pain Intensity From Facial Expressions	Pain is a personal, subjective experience that is commonly evaluated through visual analog scales (VAS). While this is often convenient and useful, automatic pain detection systems can reduce pain score acquisition efforts in large-scale studies by estimating it directly from the partictipants' facial expressions. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach for VAS estimation: first, our algorithm employs Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to automatically estimate Prkachin and Solomon Pain Intensity (PSPI) levels from face images. The estimated scores are then fed into the personalized Hidden Conditional Random Fields (HCRFs), used to estimate the VAS, provided by each person. Personalization of the model is performed us- ing a newly introduced facial expressiveness score, unique for each person. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to automatically estimate VAS from face images. We show the benefits of the proposed personalized over traditional non-personalized approach on a benchmark dataset for pain analysis from face images.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w41/html/Picard_Personalized_Automatic_Estimation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Daniel Lopez Martinez, Ognjen (Oggi) Rudovic, Rosalind Picard
Personalizing Gesture Recognition Using Hierarchical Bayesian Neural Networks	Building robust classifiers trained on data susceptible to group or subject-specific variations is a challenging pattern recognition problem. We develop hierarchical Bayesian neural networks to capture subject-specific variations and share statistical strength across subjects. Leveraging recent work on learning Bayesian neural networks, we build fast, scalable algorithms for inferring the posterior distribution over all network weights in the hierarchy. We also develop methods for adapting our model to new subjects when a small number of subject-specific personalization data is available. Finally, we investigate active learning algorithms for interactively labeling personalization data in resource-constrained scenarios. Focusing on the problem of gesture recognition where inter-subject variations are commonplace, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques. We test our framework on three widely used gesture recognition datasets, achieving personalization performance competitive with the state-of-the-art.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Joshi_Personalizing_Gesture_Recognition_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ajjen Joshi, Soumya Ghosh, Margrit Betke, Stan Sclaroff, Hanspeter Pfister
Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network	Despite the breakthroughs in accuracy and speed of single image super-resolution using faster and deeper convolutional neural networks, one central problem remains largely unsolved: how do we recover the finer texture details when we super-resolve at large upscaling factors? The behavior of optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution. In this paper, we present SRGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image super-resolution (SR). To our knowledge, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4x upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, we use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual quality using SRGAN. The MOS scores obtained with SRGAN are closer to those of the original high-resolution images than to those obtained with any state-of-the-art method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ledig_Photo-Realistic_Single_Image_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Christian Ledig, Lucas Theis, Ferenc Huszar, Jose Caballero, Andrew Cunningham, Alejandro Acosta, Andrew Aitken, Alykhan Tejani, Johannes Totz, Zehan Wang, Wenzhe Shi
Photorealistic Facial Texture Inference Using Deep Neural Networks	We present a data-driven inference method that can synthesize a photorealistic texture map of a complete 3D face model given a partial 2D view of a person in the wild. After an initial estimation of shape and low-frequency albedo, we compute a high-frequency partial texture map, without the shading component, of the visible face area. To extract the fine appearance details from this incomplete input, we introduce a multi-scale detail analysis technique based on mid-layer feature correlations extracted from a deep convolutional neural network. We demonstrate that fitting a convex combination of feature correlations from a high-resolution face database can yield a semantically plausible facial detail description of the entire face. A complete and photorealistic texture map can then be synthesized by iteratively optimizing for the reconstructed feature correlations. Using these high-resolution textures and a commercial rendering framework, we can produce high-fidelity 3D renderings that are visually comparable to those obtained with state-of-the-art multi-view face capture systems. We demonstrate successful face reconstructions from a wide range of low resolution input images, including those of historical figures. In addition to extensive evaluations, we validate the realism of our results using a crowdsourced user study.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Saito_Photorealistic_Facial_Texture_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shunsuke Saito, Lingyu Wei, Liwen Hu, Koki Nagano, Hao Li
Physically-Based Rendering for Indoor Scene Understanding Using Convolutional Neural Networks	Indoor scene understanding is central to applications such as robot navigation and human companion assistance. Over the last years, data-driven deep neural networks have outperformed many traditional approaches thanks to their representation learning capabilities. One of the bottlenecks in training for better representations is the amount of available per-pixel ground truth data that is required for core scene understanding tasks such as semantic segmentation, normal prediction, and object boundary detection. To address this problem, a number of works proposed using synthetic data. However, a systematic study of how such synthetic data is generated is missing. In this work, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset with 500K physically-based rendered images from 45K realistic 3D indoor scenes. We study the effects of rendering methods and scene lighting on training for three computer vision tasks: surface normal prediction, semantic segmentation, and object boundary detection. This study provides insights into the best practices for training with synthetic data (more realistic rendering is worth it) and shows that pretraining with our new synthetic dataset can improve results beyond the current state of the art on all three tasks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Physically-Based_Rendering_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yinda Zhang, Shuran Song, Ersin Yumer, Manolis Savva, Joon-Young Lee, Hailin Jin, Thomas Funkhouser
Physics Inspired Optimization on Semantic Transfer Features: An Alternative Method for Room Layout Estimation	In this paper, we propose an alternative method to estimate room layouts of cluttered indoor scenes. This method enjoys the benefits of two novel techniques. The first one is semantic transfer (ST), which is: (1) a formulation to integrate the relationship between scene clutter and room layout into convolutional neural networks; (2) an architecture that can be end-to-end trained; (3) a practical strategy to initialize weights for very deep networks under unbalanced training data distribution. ST allows us to extract highly robust features under various circumstances, and in order to address the computation redundance hidden in these features we develop a principled and efficient inference scheme named physics inspired optimization (PIO). PIO's basic idea is to formulate some phenomena observed in ST features into mechanics concepts. Evaluations on public datasets LSUN and Hedau show that the proposed method is more accurate than state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhao_Physics_Inspired_Optimization_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hao Zhao, Ming Lu, Anbang Yao, Yiwen Guo, Yurong Chen, Li Zhang
Pixelwise Instance Segmentation With a Dynamically Instantiated Network	Semantic segmentation and object detection research have recently achieved rapid progress. However, the former task has no notion of different instances of the same object, and the latter operates at a coarse, bounding-box level. We propose an Instance Segmentation system that produces a segmentation map where each pixel is assigned an object class and instance identity label. Most approaches adapt object detectors to produce segments instead of boxes. In contrast, our method is based on an initial semantic segmentation module, which feeds into an instance subnetwork. This subnetwork uses the initial category-level segmentation, along with cues from the output of an object detector, within an end-to-end CRF to predict instances. This part of our model is dynamically instantiated to produce a variable number of instances per image. Our end-to-end approach requires no post-processing and considers the image holistically, instead of processing independent proposals. Therefore, unlike some related work, a pixel cannot belong to multiple instances. Furthermore, far more precise segmentations are achieved, as shown by our state-of-the-art results (particularly at high IoU thresholds) on the Pascal VOC and Cityscapes datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Arnab_Pixelwise_Instance_Segmentation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Anurag Arnab, Philip H.

Plug & Play Generative Networks: Conditional Iterative Generation of Images in Latent Space	"Generating high-resolution, photo-realistic images has been a long-standing goal in machine learning. Recently, Nguyen et al. 2016 showed one interesting way to synthesize novel images by performing gradient descent in the latent space of a generator network to maximize the activations of one or multiple neurons in a separate classifier network. In this paper we extend this method by introducing an additional prior on the latent code, improving both sample quality and sample diversity, leading to a state-of-the-art generative model that produces high quality images at higher resolutions (227x227) than previous generative models, and does so for all 1000 ImageNet categories. In addition, we provide a unified probabilistic interpretation of related activation maximization methods and call the general class of models ""Plug and Play Generative Networks"". PPGNs are composed of (1) a generator network G that is capable of drawing a wide range of image types and (2) a replaceable ""condition"" network C that tells the generator what to draw. We demonstrate generation of images conditioned on a class - when C is an ImageNet classification network - and also conditioned on a caption - when C is an image captioning network. Our method also improves the state of the art of Deep Multifaceted Feature Visualization, which involves synthetically generating the set of inputs that activate a neuron in order to better understand how deep neural networks operate. Finally, we show that our model performs reasonably well at the task of image inpainting. While we operate on images in this paper, the approach is modality agnostic and can be applied to many types of data."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Nguyen_Plug__Play_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Anh Nguyen, Jeff Clune, Yoshua Bengio, Alexey Dosovitskiy, Jason Yosinski
Point to Set Similarity Based Deep Feature Learning for Person Re-Identification	Person re-identification (Re-ID) remains a challenging problem due to significant appearance changes caused by variations in view angle, background clutter, illumination condition and mutual occlusion. To address these issues, conventional methods usually focus on proposing robust feature representation or learning metric transformation based on pairwise similarity, using Fisher-type criterion. The recent development in deep learning based approaches address the two processes in a joint fashion and have achieved promising progress. One of the key issues for deep learning based person Re-ID is the selection of proper similarity comparison criteria, and the performance of learned features using existing criterion based on pairwise similarity is still limited, because only P2P distances are mostly considered. In this paper, we present a novel person Re-ID method based on P2S similarity comparison. The P2S metric can jointly minimize the intra-class distance and maximize the inter-class distance, while back-propagating the gradient to optimize parameters of the deep model. By utilizing our proposed P2S metric, the learned deep model can effectively distinguish different persons by learning discriminative and stable feature representations. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on 3DPeS, CUHK01, PRID2011 and Market1501 datasets demonstrate the advantages of our method over the state-of-the-art approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhou_Point_to_Set_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Sanping Zhou, Jinjun Wang, Jiayun Wang, Yihong Gong, Nanning Zheng
PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation	Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format, most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This, however, renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper, we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds, which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input. Our network, named PointNet, provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification, part segmentation, to scene semantic parsing. Though simple, PointNet is highly efficient and effective. Empirically, it shows strong performance on par or even better than state of the art. Theoretically, we provide analysis towards understanding of what the network has learnt and why the network is robust with respect to input perturbation and corruption.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Qi_PointNet_Deep_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Charles R.

Poisson Disk Sampling on the Grassmannnian: Applications in Subspace Optimization	To develop accurate inference algorithms on embedded manifolds such as the Grassmannian, we often employ several optimization tools and incorporate the characteristics of known manifolds as additional constraints. However, a direct analysis of the nature of functions on manifolds is rarely performed. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to this inference by adopting a statistical pipeline that first generates an initial sampling of the manifold, and then performs subsequent analysis based on these samples. First, we introduce a better sampling technique based on dart throwing (called the Poisson disk sampling (PDS)) to effectively sample the Grassmannian. Next, using Grassmannian sparse coding, we demonstrate the improved coverage achieved by PDS. Finally, we develop a consensus approach, with Grassmann samples, to infer the optimal embeddings for linear dimensionality reduction, and show that the resulting solutions are nearly optimal.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w7/html/Anirudh_Poisson_Disk_Sampling_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Rushil Anirudh, Bhavya Kailkhura, Jayaraman J.

Polarimetric Multi-View Stereo	Multi-view stereo relies on feature correspondences for 3D reconstruction, and thus is fundamentally flawed in dealing with featureless scenes. In this paper, we propose polarimetric multi-view stereo, which combines per-pixel photometric information from polarization with epipolar constraints from multiple views for 3D reconstruction. Polarization reveals surface normal information, and is thus helpful to propagate depth to featureless regions. Polarimetric multi-view stereo is completely passive and can be applied outdoors in uncontrolled illumination, since the data capture can be done simply with either a polarizer or a polarization camera. Unlike previous work on shape-from-polarization which is limited to either diffuse polarization or specular polarization only, we propose a novel polarization imaging model that can handle real-world objects with mixed polarization. We prove there are exactly two types of ambiguities on estimating surface azimuth angles from polarization, and we resolve them with graph optimization and iso-depth contour tracing. This step significantly improves the initial depth map estimate, which are later fused together for complete 3D reconstruction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate high-quality 3D reconstruction and better performance than state-of-the-art multi-view stereo methods, especially on featureless 3D objects, such as ceramic tiles, office room with white walls, and highly reflective cars in the outdoors.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Cui_Polarimetric_Multi-View_Stereo_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhaopeng Cui, Jinwei Gu, Boxin Shi, Ping Tan, Jan Kautz
PolyNet: A Pursuit of Structural Diversity in Very Deep Networks	A number of studies have shown that increasing the depth or width of convolutional networks is a rewarding approach to improve the performance of image recognition. In our study, however, we observed difficulties along both directions. On one hand, the pursuit for very deep networks is met with a diminishing return and increased training difficulty; on the other hand, widening a network would result in a quadratic growth in both computational cost and memory demand. These difficulties motivate us to explore structural diversity in designing deep networks, a new dimension beyond just depth and width. Specifically, we present a new family of modules, namely the PolyInception, which can be flexibly inserted in isolation or in a composition as replacements of different parts of a network. Choosing PolyInception modules with the guidance of architectural efficiency can improve the expressive power while preserving comparable computational cost. The Very Deep PolyNet, designed following this direction, demonstrates substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art on the ILSVRC 2012 benchmark. Compared to Inception-ResNet-v2, it reduces the top-5 validation error on single crops from 4.9% to 4.25%, and that on multi-crops from 3.7% to 3.45%.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_PolyNet_A_Pursuit_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xingcheng Zhang, Zhizhong Li, Chen Change Loy, Dahua Lin
Polyhedral Conic Classifiers for Visual Object Detection and Classification	"We propose a family of quasi-linear discriminants that outperform current large-margin methods in sliding window visual object detection and open set recognition tasks. In these tasks the classification problems are both numerically imbalanced -- positive (object class) training and test windows are much rarer than negative (non-class) ones -- and geometrically asymmetric -- the positive samples typically form compact, visually-coherent groups while negatives are much more diverse, including anything at all that is not a well-centred sample from the target class. It is difficult to cover such negative classes using training samples, and doubly so in `open set' applications where run-time negatives may stem from classes that were not seen at all during training. So there is a need for discriminants whose decision regions focus on tightly circumscribing the positive class, while still taking account of negatives in zones where the two classes overlap. This paper introduces a family of quasi-linear ""polyhedral conic"" discriminants whose positive regions are distorted L1 balls. The methods have properties and run-time complexities comparable to linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and they can be trained from either binary or positive-only samples using constrained quadratic programs related to SVMs. Our experiments show that they significantly outperform both linear SVMs and existing one-class discriminants on a wide range of object detection, open set recognition and conventional closed-set classification tasks."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Cevikalp_Polyhedral_Conic_Classifiers_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hakan Cevikalp, Bill Triggs
Pose-Aware Person Recognition	Person recognition methods that use multiple body regions have shown significant improvements over traditional face-based recognition. One of the primary challenges in full-body person recognition is the extreme variation in pose and view point. In this work, (i) we present an approach that tackles pose variations utilizing multiple models that are trained on specific poses, and combined using pose-aware weights during testing. (ii) For learning a person representation, we propose a network that jointly optimizes a single loss over multiple body regions. (iii) Finally, we introduce new benchmarks to evaluate person recognition in diverse scenarios and show significant improvements over previously proposed approaches on all the benchmarks including the photo album setting of PIPA.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kumar_Pose-Aware_Person_Recognition_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Vijay Kumar, Anoop Namboodiri, Manohar Paluri, C.

PoseAgent: Budget-Constrained 6D Object Pose Estimation via Reinforcement Learning	State-of-the-art computer vision algorithms often achieve efficiency by making discrete choices about which hypotheses to explore next. This allows allocation of computational resources to promising candidates, however, such decisions are non-differentiable. As a result, these algorithms are hard to train in an end-to-end fashion. In this work we propose to learn an efficient algorithm for the task of 6D object pose estimation. Our system optimizes the parameters of an existing state-of-the art pose estimation system using reinforcement learning, where the pose estimation system now becomes the stochastic policy, parametrized by a CNN. Additionally, we present an efficient training algorithm that dramatically reduces computation time. We show empirically that our learned pose estimation procedure makes better use of limited resources and improves upon the state-of-the-art on a challenging dataset. Our approach enables differentiable end-to-end training of complex algorithmic pipelines and learns to make optimal use of a given computational budget.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Krull_PoseAgent_Budget-Constrained_6D_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Alexander Krull, Eric Brachmann, Sebastian Nowozin, Frank Michel, Jamie Shotton, Carsten Rother
PoseTrack: Joint Multi-Person Pose Estimation and Tracking	"In this work, we introduce the challenging problem of joint multi-person pose estimation and tracking of an unknown number of persons in unconstrained videos. Existing methods for multi-person pose estimation in images cannot be applied directly to this problem, since it also requires to solve the problem of person association over time in addition to the pose estimation for each person. We therefore propose a novel method that jointly models multi-person pose estimation and tracking in a single formulation. To this end, we represent body joint detections in a video by a spatio-temporal graph and solve an integer linear program to partition the graph into sub-graphs that correspond to plausible body pose trajectories for each person. The proposed approach implicitly handles occlusion and truncation of persons. Since the problem has not been addressed quantitatively in the literature, we introduce a challenging ""Multi-Person PoseTrack"" dataset, and also propose a completely unconstrained evaluation protocol that does not make any assumptions about the scale, size, location or the number of persons. Finally, we evaluate the proposed approach and several baseline methods on our new dataset."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Iqbal_PoseTrack_Joint_Multi-Person_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Umar Iqbal, Anton Milan, Juergen Gall
Position Determines Perspective: Investigating Perspective Distortion for Image Forensics of Faces	This paper points out a new telltale trace -- the characteristic of perspective distortion (CPD), for the image forensics of faces. The perspective distortion is determined by the position of image shooting, and it is often overlooked when creating a forgery, which results in the inconsistency between the claimed camera parameters and the CPD in the face image. To investigate this consistency problem, we cast it to the consistency between the claimed camera intrinsic parameters and the estimated ones from the CPD. Our parameter estimation approach is based on geometric observations that are related to CPD, like facial landmarks and contours. We analyze the estimation uncertainty caused by indeterminacy of observation to obtain a more reliable forensic decision. Experiments on synthetic datasets and real forgery examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w28/html/Tan_Position_Determines_Perspective_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Bo Peng; Wei Wang; Jing Dong; Tieniu Tan
Position Tracking for Virtual Reality Using Commodity WiFi	Today, experiencing virtual reality (VR) is a cumbersome experience which either requires dedicated infrastructure like infrared cameras to track the headset and hand-motion controllers (e.g., Oculus Rift, HTC Vive), or provides only 3-DoF (Degrees of Freedom) tracking which severely limits the user experience (e.g., Samsung Gear). To truly enable VR everywhere, we need position tracking to be available as a ubiquitous service. This paper presents WiCapture, a novel approach which leverages commodity WiFi infrastructure, which is ubiquitous today, for tracking purposes. We prototype WiCapture using off-the-shelf WiFi radios and show that it achieves an accuracy of 0.88 cm compared to sophisticated infrared-based tracking systems like the Oculus, while providing much higher range, resistance to occlusion, ubiquity and ease of deployment.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kotaru_Position_Tracking_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Manikanta Kotaru, Sachin Katti
Predicting Behaviors of Basketball Players From First Person Videos	This paper presents a method to predict the future movements (location and gaze direction) of basketball players as a whole from their first person videos. The predicted behaviors reflect an individual physical space that affords to take the next actions while conforming to social behaviors by engaging to joint attention. Our key innovation is to use the 3D reconstruction of multiple first person cameras to automatically annotate each other's visual semantics of social configurations. We leverage two learning signals uniquely embedded in first person videos. Individually, a first person video records the visual semantics of a spatial and social layout around a person that allows associating with past similar situations. Collectively, first person videos follow joint attention that can link the individuals to a group. We learn the egocentric visual semantics of group movements using a Siamese neural network to retrieve future trajectories. We consolidate the retrieved trajectories from all players by maximizing a measure of social compatibility---the gaze alignment towards joint attention predicted by their social formation, where the dynamics of joint attention is learned by a long-term recurrent convolutional network. This allows us to characterize which social configuration is more plausible and predict future group trajectories.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Su_Predicting_Behaviors_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shan Su, Jung Pyo Hong, Jianbo Shi, Hyun Soo Park

Predicting Ground-Level Scene Layout From Aerial Imagery	We introduce a novel strategy for learning to extract semantically meaningful features from aerial imagery. Instead of manually labeling the aerial imagery, we propose to predict (noisy) semantic features automatically extracted from co-located ground imagery. Our network architecture takes an aerial image as input, extracts features using a convolutional neural network, and then applies an adaptive transformation to map these features into the ground-level perspective. We use an end-to-end learning approach to minimize the difference between the semantic segmentation extracted directly from the ground image and the semantic segmentation predicted solely based on the aerial image. We show that a model learned using this strategy, with no additional training, is already capable of rough semantic labeling of aerial imagery. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by finetuning this model we can achieve more accurate semantic segmentation than two baseline initialization strategies. We use our network to address the task of estimating the geolocation and geo-orientation of a ground image. Finally, we show how features extracted from an aerial image can be used to hallucinate a plausible ground-level panorama.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhai_Predicting_Ground-Level_Scene_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Menghua Zhai, Zachary Bessinger, Scott Workman, Nathan Jacobs
Predicting Salient Face in Multiple-Face Videos	Although the recent success of convolutional neural network (CNN) advances state-of-the-art saliency prediction in static images, few work has addressed the problem of predicting attention in videos. On the other hand, we find that the attention of different subjects consistently focuses on a single face in each frame of videos involving multiple faces. Therefore, we propose in this paper a novel deep learning (DL) based method to predict salient face in multiple-face videos, which is capable of learning features and transition of salient faces across video frames. In particular, we first learn a CNN for each frame to locate salient face. Taking CNN features as input, we develop a multiple-stream long short-term memory (M-LSTM) network to predict the temporal transition of salient faces in video sequences. To evaluate our DL-based method, we build a new eye-tracking database of multiple-face videos. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the prior state-of-the-art methods in predicting visual attention on faces in multiple-face videos.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Liu_Predicting_Salient_Face_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yufan Liu, Songyang Zhang, Mai Xu, Xuming He
Predictive-Corrective Networks for Action Detection	"While deep feature learning has revolutionized techniques for static-image understanding, the same does not quite hold for video processing. Architectures and optimization techniques used for video are largely based off those for static images, potentially underutilizing rich video information. In this work, we rethink both the underlying network architecture and the stochastic learning paradigm for temporal data. To do so, we draw inspiration from classic theory on linear dynamic systems for modeling time series. By extending such models to include nonlinear mappings, we derive a series of novel recurrent neural networks that sequentially make top-down predictions about the future and then correct those predictions with bottom-up observations. Predictive-corrective networks have a number of desirable properties: (1) they can adaptively focus computation on ""surprising"" frames where predictions require large corrections, (2) they simplify learning in that only ""residual-like"" corrective terms need to be learned over time and (3) they naturally decorrelate an input data stream in a hierarchical fashion, producing a more reliable signal for learning at each layer of a network. We provide an extensive analysis of our lightweight and interpretable framework, and demonstrate that our model is competitive with the two-stream network on three challenging datasets without the need for computationally expensive optical flow."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Dave_Predictive-Corrective_Networks_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Achal Dave, Olga Russakovsky, Deva Ramanan
Primary Object Segmentation in Videos Based on Region Augmentation and Reduction	A novel algorithm to segment a primary object in a video sequence is proposed in this work. First, we generate candidate regions for the primary object using both color and motion edges. Second,we estimate initial primary object regions, by exploiting the recurrence property of the primary object. Third, we augment the initial regions with missing parts or reducing them by excluding noisy parts repeatedly. This augmentation and reduction process (ARP) identifies the primary object region in each frame. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art conventional algorithms on recent benchmark datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Koh_Primary_Object_Segmentation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yeong Jun Koh, Chang-Su Kim
Privacy-Preserving Understanding of Human Body Orientation for Smart Meetings	We present a method for estimating the body orientation of seated people in a smart room by fusing low-resolution range information collected from downward pointed time-of- flight (ToF) sensors with synchronized speaker identification information from microphone recordings. The ToF sensors preserve the privacy of the occupants in that they only return the range to a small set of hit points. We propose a Bayesian estimation algorithm for the quantized body orientations in which the likelihood term is based on the observed ToF data and the prior term is based on the occupants' locations and current speakers. We evaluate our algorithm in real meeting scenarios and show that it is possible to accurately estimate seated human orientation even with very low-resolution systems.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w3/html/Bhattacharya_Privacy-Preserving_Understanding_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Indrani Bhattacharya, Noam Eshed, Richard J.

Probabilistic Global Scale Estimation for MonoSLAM Based on Generic Object Detection	This paper proposes a novel method to estimate the global scale of a 3D reconstructed model within a Kalman filtering-based monocular SLAM algorithm. Our Bayesian framework integrates height priors over the detected objects belonging to a set of broad predefined classes, based on recent advances in fast generic object detection. Each observation is produced on single frames, so that we do not need a data association process along video frames. This is because we associate the height priors with the image region sizes at image places where map features projections fall within the object detection regions. We present very promising results of this approach obtained on several experiments with different object classes.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w10/html/Sucar_Probabilistic_Global_Scale_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Edgar Sucar, Jean-Bernard Hayet
Probabilistic Temporal Subspace Clustering	Subspace clustering is a common modeling paradigm used to identify constituent modes of variation in data with locally linear structure. These structures are common to many problems in computer vision, including modeling time series of complex human motion. However classical subspace clustering algorithms learn the relationships within a set of data without considering the temporal dependency and then use a separate clustering step (e.g., spectral clustering) for final segmentation. Moreover, these, frequently optimization-based, algorithms assume that all observations have complete features. In contrast in real-world applications, some features are often missing, which results in incomplete data and substantial performance degeneration of these approaches. In this paper, we propose a unified non-parametric generative framework for temporal subspace clustering to segment data drawn from a sequentially ordered union of subspaces that deals with the missing features in a principled way. The non-parametric nature of our generative model makes it possible to infer the number of subspaces and their dimension automatically from data. Experimental results on human action datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art subspace clustering approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Gholami_Probabilistic_Temporal_Subspace_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Behnam Gholami, Vladimir Pavlovic
Procedural Generation of Videos to Train Deep Action Recognition Networks	"Deep learning for human action recognition in videos is making significant progress, but is slowed down by its dependency on expensive manual labeling of large video collections. In this work, we investigate the generation of synthetic training data for action recognition, as it has recently shown promising results for a variety of other computer vision tasks. We propose an interpretable parametric generative model of human action videos that relies on procedural generation and other computer graphics techniques of modern game engines. We generate a diverse, realistic, and physically plausible dataset of human action videos, called PHAV for ""Procedural Human Action Videos"". It contains a total of 39,982 videos, with more than 1,000 examples for each action of 35 categories. Our approach is not limited to existing motion capture sequences, and we procedurally define 14 synthetic actions. We introduce a deep multi-task representation learning architecture to mix synthetic and real videos, even if the action categories differ. Our experiments on the UCF101 and HMDB51 benchmarks suggest that combining our large set of synthetic videos with small real-world datasets can boost recognition performance, significantly outperforming fine-tuning state-of-the-art unsupervised generative models of videos."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/de_Souza_Procedural_Generation_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Cesar Roberto de Souza, Adrien Gaidon, Yohann Cabon, Antonio Manuel Lopez
Product Manifold Filter: Non-Rigid Shape Correspondence via Kernel Density Estimation in the Product Space	Many algorithms for the computation of correspondences between deformable shapes rely on some variant of nearest neighbor matching in a descriptor space. Such are, for example, various point-wise correspondence recovery algorithms used as a post-processing stage in the functional correspondence framework. Such frequently used techniques implicitly make restrictive assumptions (e.g., nearisometry) on the considered shapes and in practice suffer from lack of accuracy and result in poor surjectivity. We propose an alternative recovery technique capable of guaranteeing a bijective correspondence and producing significantly higher accuracy and smoothness. Unlike other methods our approach does not depend on the assumption that the analyzed shapes are isometric. We derive the proposed method from the statistical framework of kernel density estimation and demonstrate its performance on several challenging deformable 3D shape matching datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Vestner_Product_Manifold_Filter_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Matthias Vestner, Roee Litman, Emanuele Rodola, Alex Bronstein, Daniel Cremers
Product Split Trees	In this work, we introduce a new kind of spatial partition trees for efficient nearest-neighbor search. Our approach first identifies a set of useful data splitting directions, and then learns a codebook that can be used to encode such directions. We use the product-quantization idea in order to make the effective codebook large, the evaluation of scalar products between the query and the encoded splitting direction very fast, and the encoding itself compact. As a result, the proposed data srtucture (Product Split tree) achieves compact clustering of data points, while keeping the traversal very efficient. In the nearest-neighbor search experiments on high-dimensional data, product split trees achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating better speed-accuracy tradeoff than other spatial partition trees.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Babenko_Product_Split_Trees_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Artem Babenko, Victor Lempitsky
Protecting Visual Secrets Using Adversarial Nets	Protecting visual secrets is an important problem due to the prevalence of cameras that continuously monitor our surroundings. Any viable solution to this problem should also minimize the impact on the utility of applications that use images. In this work, we build on the existing work of adversarial learning to design a perturbation mechanism that jointly optimizes privacy and utility objectives. We provide a feasibility study of the proposed mechanism and present ideas on developing a privacy framework based on the adversarial perturbation mechanism.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w16/html/Cox_Protecting_Visual_Secrets_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Nisarg Raval; Ashwin Machanavajjhala; Landon P.

Provable Self-Representation Based Outlier Detection in a Union of Subspaces	Many computer vision tasks involve processing large amounts of data contaminated by outliers, which need to be detected and rejected. While outlier detection methods based on robust statistics have existed for decades, only recently have methods based on sparse and low-rank representation been developed along with guarantees of correct outlier detection when the inliers lie in one or more low-dimensional subspaces. This paper proposes a new outlier detection method that combines tools from sparse representation with random walks on a graph. By exploiting the property that data points can be expressed as sparse linear combinations of each other, we obtain an asymmetric affinity matrix among data points, which we use to construct a weighted directed graph. By defining a suitable Markov Chain from this graph, we establish a connection between inliers/outliers and essential/inessential states of the Markov chain, which allows us to detect outliers by using random walks. We provide a theoretical analysis that justifies the correctness of our method under geometric and connectivity assumptions. Experimental results on image databases demonstrate its superiority with respect to state-of-the-art sparse and low-rank outlier detection methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/You_Provable_Self-Representation_Based_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chong You, Daniel P.

Pruning ConvNets Online for Efficient Specialist Models	Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel in various computer vision related tasks but are extremely computationally intensive and power hungry to run on mobile and embedded devices. Recent pruning techniques can reduce the computation and memory requirements of CNNs, but a costly retraining step is needed to restore the classification accuracy of the pruned model. In this paper, we present evidence that when only a subset of the classes need to be classified, we could prune a model and achieve reasonable classification accuracy without retraining. The resulting specialist model will require less energy and time to run than the original full model. To compensate for the pruning, we take advantage of the redundancy among filters and class-specific features. We show that even simple methods such as replacing channels with mean or with the most correlated channel can boost the accuracy of the pruned model to reasonable levels.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w4/html/Guo_Pruning_ConvNets_Online_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jia Guo, Miodrag Potkonjak
Pyramid Scene Parsing Network	Scene parsing is challenging for unrestricted open vocabulary and diverse scenes. In this paper, we exploit the capability of global context information by different-region-based context aggregation through our pyramid pooling module together with the proposed pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet). Our global prior representation is effective to produce good quality results on the scene parsing task, while PSPNet provides a superior framework for pixel-level prediction. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets. It came first in ImageNet scene parsing challenge 2016, PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark and Cityscapes benchmark. A single PSPNet yields the new record of mIoU accuracy 85.4% on PASCAL VOC 2012 and accuracy 80.2% on Cityscapes.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhao_Pyramid_Scene_Parsing_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hengshuang Zhao, Jianping Shi, Xiaojuan Qi, Xiaogang Wang, Jiaya Jia
Quad-Networks: Unsupervised Learning to Rank for Interest Point Detection	"Several machine learning tasks require to represent the data using only a sparse set of interest points. An ideal detector is able to find the corresponding interest points even if the data undergo a transformation typical for a given domain. Since the task is of high practical interest in computer vision, many hand-crafted solutions were proposed. In this paper, we ask a fundamental question: can we learn such detectors from scratch? Since it is often unclear what points are ""interesting"", human labelling cannot be used to find a truly unbiased solution. Therefore, the task requires an unsupervised formulation. We are the first to propose such a formulation: training a neural network to rank points in a transformation-invariant manner. Interest points are then extracted from the top/bottom quantiles of this ranking. We validate our approach on two tasks: standard RGB image interest point detection and challenging cross-modal interest point detection between RGB and depth images. We quantitatively show that our unsupervised method performs better or on-par with baselines."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Savinov_Quad-Networks_Unsupervised_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Nikolay Savinov, Akihito Seki, Lubor Ladicky, Torsten Sattler, Marc Pollefeys
Quality Aware Network for Set to Set Recognition	This paper targets on the problem of set to set recognition, which learns the metric between two image sets. Images in each set belong to the same identity. Since images in a set can be complementary, they hopefully lead to higher accuracy in practical applications. However, the quality of each sample cannot be guaranteed, and samples with poor quality will hurt the metric. In this paper, the quality aware network (QAN) is proposed to confront this problem, where the quality of each sample can be automatically learned although such information is not explicitly provided in the training stage. The network has two branches, where the first branch extracts appearance feature embedding for each sample and the other branch predicts quality score for each sample. Features and quality scores of all samples in a set are then aggregated to generate the final feature embedding. We show that the two branches can be trained in an end-to-end manner given only the set-level identity annotation. Analysis on gradient spread of this mechanism indicates that the quality learned by the network is beneficial to set-to-set recognition and simplifies the distribution that the network needs to fit. Experiments on both face verification and person re-identification show advantages of the proposed QAN.

Query-Focused Video Summarization: Dataset, Evaluation, and a Memory Network Based Approach	Recent years have witnessed a resurgence of interest in video summarization. However, one of the main obstacles to the research on video summarization is the user subjectivity --- users have various preferences over the summaries. The subjectiveness causes at least two problems. First, no single video summarizer fits all users unless it interacts with and adapts to the individual users. Second, it is very challenging to evaluate the performance of a video summarizer. To tackle the first problem, we explore the recently proposed query-focused video summarization which introduces user preferences in the form of text queries about the video into the summarization process. We propose a memory network parameterized sequential determinantal point process in order to attend the user query onto different video frames and shots. To address the second challenge, we contend that a good evaluation metric for video summarization should focus on the semantic information that humans can perceive rather than the visual features or temporal overlaps. To this end, we collect dense per-video-shot concept annotations, compile a new dataset, and suggest an efficient evaluation method defined upon the concept annotations. We conduct extensive experiments contrasting our video summarizer to existing ones and present detailed analyses about the dataset and the new evaluation method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Sharghi_Query-Focused_Video_Summarization_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Aidean Sharghi, Jacob S.

Quo Vadis, Action Recognition? A New Model and the Kinetics Dataset	The paucity of videos in current action classification datasets (UCF-101 and HMDB-51) has made it difficult to identify good video architectures, as most methods obtain similar performance on existing small-scale benchmarks. This paper re-evaluates state-of-the-art architectures in light of the new Kinetics Human Action Video dataset. Kinetics has two orders of magnitude more data, with 400 human action classes and over 400 clips per class, and is collected from realistic, challenging YouTube videos. We provide an analysis on how current architectures fare on the task of action classification on this dataset and how much performance improves on the smaller benchmark datasets after pre-training on Kinetics. We also introduce a new Two-Stream Inflated 3D ConvNet (I3D) that is based on 2D ConvNet inflation: filters and pooling kernels of very deep image classification ConvNets are expanded into 3D, making it possible to learn seamless spatio-temporal feature extractors from video while leveraging successful ImageNet architecture designs and even their parameters. We show that, after pre-training on Kinetics, I3D models considerably improve upon the state-of-the-art in action classification, reaching 80.2% on HMDB-51 and 97.9% on UCF-101.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Carreira_Quo_Vadis_Action_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Joao Carreira, Andrew Zisserman
RATM: Recurrent Attentive Tracking Model	We present an attention-based modular neural framework for computer vision. The framework uses a soft attention mechanism allowing models to be trained with gradient descent. It consists of three modules: a recurrent attention module controlling where to look in an image or video frame, a feature-extraction module providing a representation of what is seen, and an objective module formalizing why the model learns its attentive behavior. The attention module allows the model to focus computation on task-related information in the input. We apply the framework to several object tracking tasks and explore various design choices. We experiment with three data sets, bouncing ball, moving digits and the real-world KTH data set. The proposed RATM performs well on all three tasks and can generalize to related but previously unseen sequences from a challenging tracking data set.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w20/html/Kahou_RATM_Recurrent_Attentive_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, Vincent Michalski, Roland Memisevic, Christopher Pal, Pascal Vincent
RGB-D Scene Labeling With Multimodal Recurrent Neural Networks	Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are able to capture context in an image by modeling long-range semantic dependencies among image units. However, existing methods only utilize RNNs to model dependencies of a single modality (e.g., RGB) for labeling. In this work we extend this single-modal RNNs to multimodal RNNs (MM-RNNs) and apply it to RGB-D scene labeling. Our MM-RNNs are capable of seamlessly modeling dependencies of both RGB and depth modalities, and allow 'memory' sharing across modalities. By sharing 'memory', each modality possesses multiple properties of itself and other modalities, and becomes more discriminative to distinguish pixels. Moreover, we also analyse two simple extensions of single-modal RNNs and demonstrate that our MM-RNNs perform better than both of them. Integrating with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we build an end-to-end network for RGB-D scene labeling. Extensive experiments on NYU depth V1 and V2 demonstrate the effectiveness of MM-RNNs.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w3/html/Fan_RGB-D_Scene_Labeling_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Heng Fan, Xue Mei, Danil Prokhorov, Haibin Ling
ROAM: A Rich Object Appearance Model With Application to Rotoscoping	Rotoscoping, the detailed delineation of scene elements through a video shot, is a painstaking task of tremendous importance in professional post-production pipelines. While pixel-wise segmentation techniques can help for this task, professional rotoscoping tools rely on parametric curves that offer the artists a much better interactive control on the definition, editing and manipulation of the segments of interest. Sticking to this prevalent rotoscoping paradigm, we propose a novel framework to capture and track the visual aspect of an arbitrary object in a scene, given a first closed outline of this object. This model combines a collection of local foreground/background appearance models spread along the outline, a global appearance model of the enclosed object and a set of distinctive foreground landmarks. The structure of this rich appearance model allows simple initialization, efficient iterative optimization with exact minimization at each step, and on-line adaptation in videos. We demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively the merit of this framework through comparisons with tools based on either dynamic segmentation with a closed curve or pixel-wise binary labelling.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Miksik_ROAM_A_Rich_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ondrej Miksik, Juan-Manuel Perez-Rua, Philip H.

RON: Reverse Connection With Objectness Prior Networks for Object Detection	We present RON, an efficient and effective framework for generic object detection. Our motivation is to smartly associate the best of the region-based (e.g., Faster R-CNN) and region-free (e.g., SSD) methodologies. Under fully convolutional architecture, RON mainly focuses on two fundamental problems: (a) multi-scale object localization and (b) negative sample mining. To address (a), we design the reverse connection, which enables the network to detect objects on multi-levels of CNNs. To deal with (b), we propose the objectness prior to significantly reduce the searching space of objects. We optimize the reverse connection, objectness prior and object detector jointly by a multi-task loss function, thus RON can directly predict final detection results from all locations of various feature maps. Extensive experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2007, PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO benchmarks demonstrate the competitive performance of RON. Specifically, with VGG-16 and low resolution 384*384 input size, the network gets 81.3% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007, 80.7% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets. Its superiority increases when datasets become larger and more difficult, as demonstrated by the results on the MS COCO dataset. With 1.5G GPU memory at test phase, the speed of the network is 15 FPS, 3 times faster than the Faster R-CNN counterpart. Code will be made publicly available.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kong_RON_Reverse_Connection_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tao Kong, Fuchun Sun, Anbang Yao, Huaping Liu, Ming Lu, Yurong Chen
Radiometric Calibration From Faces in Images	We present a method for radiometric calibration of cameras from a single image that contains a human face. This technique takes advantage of a low-rank property that exists among certain skin albedo gradients because of the pigments within the skin. This property becomes distorted in images that are captured with a non-linear camera response function, and we perform radiometric calibration by solving for the inverse response function that best restores this low-rank property in an image. Although this work makes use of the color properties of skin pigments, we show that this calibration is unaffected by the color of scene illumination or the sensitivities of the camera's color filters. Our experiments validate this approach on a variety of images containing human faces, and show that faces can provide an important source of calibration data in images where existing radiometric calibration techniques perform poorly.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Li_Radiometric_Calibration_From_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chen Li, Stephen Lin, Kun Zhou, Katsushi Ikeuchi
Radiometric Calibration for Internet Photo Collections	Radiometrically calibrating the images from Internet photo collections brings photometric analysis from lab data to big image data in the wild, but conventional calibration methods cannot be directly applied to such image data. This paper presents a method to jointly perform radiometric calibration for a set of images in an Internet photo collection. By incorporating the consistency of scene reflectance for corresponding pixels in multiple images, the proposed method estimates radiometric response functions of all the images using a rank minimization framework. Our calibration aligns all response functions in an image set up to the same exponential ambiguity in a robust manner. Quantitative results using both synthetic and real data show the effectiveness of the proposed method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Mo_Radiometric_Calibration_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhipeng Mo, Boxin Shi, Sai-Kit Yeung, Yasuyuki Matsushita
Re-Ranking Person Re-Identification With k-Reciprocal Encoding	When considering person re-identification (re-ID) as a retrieval process, re-ranking is a critical step to improve its accuracy. Yet in the re-ID community, limited effort has been devoted to re-ranking, especially those fully automatic, unsupervised solutions. In this paper, we propose a k-reciprocal encoding method to re-rank the re-ID results. Our hypothesis is that if a gallery image is similar to the probe in the k-reciprocal nearest neighbors, it is more likely to be a true match. Specifically, given an image, a k-reciprocal feature is calculated by encoding its k-reciprocal nearest neighbors into a single vector, which is used for re-ranking under the Jaccard distance. The final distance is computed as the combination of the original distance and the Jaccard distance. Our re-ranking method does not require any human interaction or any labeled data, so it is applicable to large-scale datasets. Experiments on the large-scale Market-1501, CUHK03, MARS, and PRW datasets confirm the effectiveness of our method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhong_Re-Ranking_Person_Re-Identification_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhun Zhong, Liang Zheng, Donglin Cao, Shaozi Li
Re-Sign: Re-Aligned End-To-End Sequence Modelling With Deep Recurrent CNN-HMMs	This work presents an iterative re-alignment approach applicable to visual sequence labelling tasks such as gesture recognition, activity recognition and continuous sign language recognition. Previous methods dealing with video data usually rely on given frame labels to train their classifiers. However, looking at recent data sets, these labels often tend to be noisy which is commonly overseen. We propose an algorithm that treats the provided training labels as weak labels and refines the label-to-image alignment on-the-fly in a weakly supervised fashion. Given a series of frames and sequence-level labels, a deep recurrent CNN-BLSTM network is trained end-to-end. Embedded into an HMM the resulting deep model corrects the frame labels and continuously improves its performance in several re-alignments. We evaluate on two challenging publicly available sign recognition benchmark data sets featuring over 1000 classes. We outperform the state-of-the-art by up to 10% absolute and 30% relative.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Koller_Re-Sign_Re-Aligned_End-To-End_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Oscar Koller, Sepehr Zargaran, Hermann Ney

Real-Time Driver Drowsiness Detection for Embedded System Using Model Compression of Deep Neural Networks	Driver's status is crucial because one of the main reasons for motor vehicular accidents is related to driver's inattention or drowsiness. A drowsiness detector on a car can reduce numerous accidents. Accidents occur because of a single moment of negligence, thus driver monitoring system which works in real-time is necessary. This detector should be deployable to an embedded device and perform at high accuracy. In this paper, a novel approach towards real-time drowsiness detection based on deep learning which can be implemented on a low cost embedded board and performs with a high accuracy is proposed. Main contribution of our paper is compression of heavy baseline model to a light weight model deployable to an embedded board. Moreover, minimized network structure was designed based on facial landmark input to recognize whether driver is drowsy or not. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 89.5% on 3-class classification and speed of 14.9 frames per second (FPS) on Jetson TK1.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w4/html/Reddy_Real-Time_Driver_Drowsiness_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Bhargava Reddy, Ye-Hoon Kim, Sojung Yun, Chanwon Seo, Junik Jang
Real-Time Hand Grasp Recognition Using Weakly Supervised Two-Stage Convolutional Neural Networks for Understanding Manipulation Actions	Understanding human hand usage is one of the richest information source to recognize human manipulation actions. Since humans use various tools during actions, grasp recognition gives important cues to figure out humans' intention and tasks. Earlier studies analyzed grasps with positions of hand joints by attaching sensors, but since these types of sensors prevent humans from naturally conducting actions, visual approaches have been focused in recent years. Convolutional neural networks require a vast annotated dataset, but, to our knowledge, no human grasping dataset includes ground truth of hand regions. In this paper, we propose a grasp recognition method only with image-level labels by the weakly supervised learning framework. In addition, we split the grasp recognition process into two stages that are hand localization and grasp classification so as to speed up. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods and can perform in real-time.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w5/html/Kim_Real-Time_Hand_Grasp_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ji Woong Kim, Sujeong You, Sang Hoon Ji, Hong Seok Kim
Real-Time Neural Style Transfer for Videos	Recent research endeavors have shown the potential of using feed-forward convolutional neural networks to accomplish fast style transfer for images. In this work, we take one step further to explore the possibility of exploiting a feed-forward network to perform style transfer for videos and simultaneously maintain temporal consistency among stylized video frames. Our feed-forward network is trained by enforcing the outputs of consecutive frames to be both well stylized and temporally consistent. More specifically, a hybrid loss is proposed to capitalize on the content information of input frames, the style information of a given style image, and the temporal information of consecutive frames. To calculate the temporal loss during the training stage, a novel two-frame synergic training mechanism is proposed. Compared with directly applying an existing image style transfer method to videos, our proposed method employs the trained network to yield temporally consistent stylized videos which are much more visually pleasant. In contrast to the prior video style transfer method which relies on time-consuming optimization on the fly, our method runs in real time while generating competitive visual results.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Huang_Real-Time_Neural_Style_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Haozhi Huang, Hao Wang, Wenhan Luo, Lin Ma, Wenhao Jiang, Xiaolong Zhu, Zhifeng Li, Wei Liu
Real-Time Video Super-Resolution With Spatio-Temporal Networks and Motion Compensation	Convolutional neural networks have enabled accurate image super-resolution in real-time. However, recent attempts to benefit from temporal correlations in video super-resolution have been limited to naive or inefficient architectures. In this paper, we introduce spatio-temporal sub-pixel convolution networks that effectively exploit temporal redundancies and improve reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time speed. Specifically, we discuss the use of early fusion, slow fusion and 3D convolutions for the joint processing of multiple consecutive video frames. We also propose a novel joint motion compensation and video super-resolution algorithm that is orders of magnitude more efficient than competing methods, relying on a fast multi-resolution spatial transformer module that is end-to-end trainable. These contributions provide both higher accuracy and temporally more consistent videos, which we confirm qualitatively and quantitatively. Relative to single-frame models, spatio-temporal networks can either reduce the computational cost by 30% whilst maintaining the same quality or provide a 0.2dB gain for a similar computational cost. Results on publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms surpass current state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Caballero_Real-Time_Video_Super-Resolution_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jose Caballero, Christian Ledig, Andrew Aitken, Alejandro Acosta, Johannes Totz, Zehan Wang, Wenzhe Shi
Realtime Multi-Person 2D Pose Estimation Using Part Affinity Fields	We present an approach to efficiently detect the 2D pose of multiple people in an image. The approach uses a nonparametric representation, which we refer to as Part Affinity Fields (PAFs), to learn to associate body parts with individuals in the image. The architecture encodes global context, allowing a greedy bottom-up parsing step that maintains high accuracy while achieving realtime performance, irrespective of the number of people in the image. The architecture is designed to jointly learn part locations and their association via two branches of the same sequential prediction process. Our method placed first in the inaugural COCO 2016 keypoints challenge, and significantly exceeds the previous state-of-the-art result on the MPII Multi-Person benchmark, both in performance and efficiency.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Cao_Realtime_Multi-Person_2D_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhe Cao, Tomas Simon, Shih-En Wei, Yaser Sheikh
Rear-Stitched View Panorama: A Low-Power Embedded Implementation for Smart Rear-View Mirrors on Vehicles	Automobiles are currently equipped with a three-mirror system for rear-view visualization. The two side-view mirrors show close the periphery on the left and right sides of the vehicle, and the center rear-view mirror is typically adjusted to allow the driver to see through the vehicle's rear windshield. This three-mirror system, however, imposes safety concerns in requiring drivers to shift their attention and gaze to look in each mirror to obtain a full visualization of the rear-view surroundings, which takes attention off the scene in front of the vehicle. We present an alternative to the three-mirror rear-view system, which we call Rear-Stitched View Panorama (RSVP). The proposed system uses four rear-facing cameras, strategically placed to overcome the traditional blind spot problem, and stitches the feeds from each camera together to generate a single panoramic view, which can display the entire rear surroundings. We project individually captured frames onto a single virtual view using precomputed system calibration parameters. Then we determine optimal seam lines, along which the images are fused together to form the single RSVP view presented to the driver. Furthermore, we highlight techniques that enable efficient embedded implementation of the system and showcase a real-time system utilizing under 2W of power, making it suitable for in-cabin deployment in vehicles.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w13/html/Pan_Rear-Stitched_View_Panorama_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Janice Pan, Vikram Appia, Jesse Villarreal, Lucas Weaver, Do-Kyoung Kwon
Recognition of Affect in the Wild Using Deep Neural Networks	"In this paper we utilize the first large-scale ""in-the-wild"" (Aff-Wild) database, which is annotated in terms of the valence-arousal dimensions, to train and test an end-to-end deep neural architecture for the estimation of continuous emotion dimensions based on visual cues. The proposed architecture is based on jointly training convolutional (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) layers, thus exploiting both the invariant properties of convolutional features, while also modelling temporal dynamics that arise in human behaviour via the recurrent layers. Various pre-trained networks are used as starting structures which are subsequently appropriately fine-tuned to the Aff-Wild database. Obtained results show premise for the utilization of deep architectures for the visual analysis of human behaviour in terms of continuous emotion dimensions and analysis of different types of affect."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w33/html/Kollias_Recognition_of_Affect_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Dimitrios Kollias, Mihalis A.

Reconstructing Intensity Images From Binary Spatial Gradient Cameras	Binary gradient cameras extract edge and temporal information directly on the sensor, allowing for low-power, low-bandwidth, and high-dynamic-range capabilities---all critical factors for the deployment of embedded computer vision systems. However, these types of images require specialized computer vision algorithms and are not easy to interpret by a human observer. In this paper we propose to recover an intensity image from a single binary spatial gradient image with a deep auto-encoder. Extensive experimental results on both simulated and real data show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w4/html/Jayasuriya_Reconstructing_Intensity_Images_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Suren Jayasuriya, Orazio Gallo, Jinwei Gu, Timo Aila, Jan Kautz
Reconstructing Transient Images From Single-Photon Sensors	"Computer vision algorithms build on 2D images or 3D videos that capture dynamic events at the millisecond time scale. However, capturing and analyzing ""transient images"" at the picosecond scale---i.e., at one trillion frames per second---reveals unprecedented information about a scene and light transport within. This is not only crucial for time-of-flight range imaging, but it also helps further our understanding of light transport phenomena at a more fundamental level and potentially allows to revisit many assumptions made in different computer vision algorithms. In this work, we design and evaluate an imaging system that builds on single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) sensors to capture multi-path responses with picosecond-scale active illumination. We develop inverse methods that use modern approaches to deconvolve and denoise measurements in the presence of Poisson noise, and compute transient images at a higher quality than previously reported. The small form factor, fast acquisition rates, and relatively low cost of our system potentially makes transient imaging more practical for a range of applications."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/OToole_Reconstructing_Transient_Images_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Matthew O'Toole, Felix Heide, David B.

Recurrent 3D Pose Sequence Machines	3D human articulated pose recovery from monocular image sequences is very challenging due to the diverse appearances, viewpoints, occlusions, and also the human 3D pose is inherently ambiguous from the monocular imagery. It is thus critical to exploit rich spatial and temporal long-range dependencies among body joints for accurate 3D pose sequence prediction. Existing approaches usually manually design some elaborate prior terms and human body kinematic constraints for capturing structures, which are often insufficient to exploit all intrinsic structures and not scalable for all scenarios. In contrast, this paper presents a Recurrent 3D Pose Sequence Machine(RPSM) to automatically learn the image-dependent structural constraint and sequence-dependent temporal context by using a multi-stage sequential refinement. At each stage, our RPSM is composed of three modules to predict the 3D pose sequences based on the previously learned 2D pose representations and 3D poses: (i) a 2D pose module extracting the image-dependent pose representations, (ii) a 3D pose recurrent module regressing 3D poses and (iii) a feature adaption module serving as a bridge between module (i) and (ii) to enable the representation transformation from 2D to 3D domain. These three modules are then assembled into a sequential prediction framework to refine the predicted poses with multiple recurrent stages. Extensive evaluations on the Human3.6M dataset and HumanEva-I dataset show that our RPSM outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches for 3D pose estimation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lin_Recurrent_3D_Pose_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mude Lin, Liang Lin, Xiaodan Liang, Keze Wang, Hui Cheng
Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks for Continuous Sign Language Recognition by Staged Optimization	This work presents a weakly supervised framework with deep neural networks for vision-based continuous sign language recognition, where the ordered gloss labels but no exact temporal locations are available with the video of sign sentence, and the amount of labeled sentences for training is limited. Our approach addresses the mapping of video segments to glosses by introducing recurrent convolutional neural network for spatio-temporal feature extraction and sequence learning. We design a three-stage optimization process for our architecture. First, we develop an end-to-end sequence learning scheme and employ connectionist temporal classification (CTC) as the objective function for alignment proposal. Second, we take the alignment proposal as stronger supervision to tune our feature extractor. Finally, we optimize the sequence learning model with the improved feature representations, and design a weakly supervised detection network for regularization. We apply the proposed approach to a real-world continuous sign language recognition benchmark, and our method, with no extra supervision, achieves results comparable to the state-of-the-art.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Cui_Recurrent_Convolutional_Neural_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Runpeng Cui, Hu Liu, Changshui Zhang
Recurrent Memory Addressing for Describing Videos	In this paper, we introduce Key-Value Memory Networks to a multimodal setting and a novel key-addressing mechanism to deal with sequence-to-sequence models. The proposed model naturally decomposes the problem of video captioning into vision and language segments, dealing with them as key-value pairs. More specifically, we learn a semantic embedding (v) corresponding to each frame (k) in the video, thereby creating (k, v) memory slots. We propose to find the next step attention weights conditioned on the previous attention distributions for the key-value memory slots in the memory addressing schema. Exploiting this flexibility of the framework, we additionally capture spatial dependencies while mapping from the visual to semantic embedding. Experiments done on the Youtube2Text dataset demonstrate usefulness of recurrent key-addressing, while achieving competitive scores on BLEU@4, METEOR metrics against state-of-the-art models.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w37/html/Jain_Recurrent_Memory_Addressing_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Arnav Kumar Jain, Abhinav Agarwalla, Kumar Krishna Agrawal, Pabitra Mitra
Recurrent Modeling of Interaction Context for Collective Activity Recognition	Modeling of high order interactional context, e.g., group interaction, lies in the central of collective/group activity recognition. However, most of the previous activity recognition methods do not offer a flexible and scalable scheme to handle the high order context modeling problem. To explicitly address this fundamental bottleneck, we propose a recurrent interactional context modeling scheme based on LSTM network. By utilizing the information propagation/aggregation capability of LSTM, the proposed scheme unifies the interactional feature modeling process for single person dynamics, intra-group (e.g., persons within a group) and inter-group(e.g., group to group)interactions. The proposed high order context modeling scheme produces more discriminative/descriptive interactional features. It is very flexible to handle a varying number of input instances (e.g., different number of persons in a group or different number of groups) and linearly scalable to high order context modeling problem. Extensive experiments on two benchmark collective/group activity datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_Recurrent_Modeling_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Minsi Wang, Bingbing Ni, Xiaokang Yang
RefineNet: Multi-Path Refinement Networks for High-Resolution Semantic Segmentation	Recently, very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown outstanding performance in object recognition and have also been the first choice for dense classification problems such as semantic segmentation. However, repeated subsampling operations like pooling or convolution striding in deep CNNs lead to a significant decrease in the initial image resolution. Here, we present RefineNet, a generic multi-path refinement network that explicitly exploits all the information available along the down-sampling process to enable high-resolution prediction using long-range residual connections. In this way, the deeper layers that capture high-level semantic features can be directly refined using fine-grained features from earlier convolutions. The individual components of RefineNet employ residual connections following the identity mapping mindset, which allows for effective end-to-end training. Further, we introduce chained residual pooling, which captures rich background context in an efficient manner. We carry out comprehensive experiments and set new state-of-the-art results on seven public datasets. In particular, we achieve an intersection-over-union score of 83.4 on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, which is the best reported result to date.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lin_RefineNet_Multi-Path_Refinement_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Guosheng Lin, Anton Milan, Chunhua Shen, Ian Reid
Reflectance Adaptive Filtering Improves Intrinsic Image Estimation	Separating an image into reflectance and shading layers poses a challenge for learning approaches because no large corpus of precise and realistic ground truth decompositions exists. The Intrinsic Images in the Wild (IIW) dataset provides a sparse set of relative human reflectance judgments, which serves as a standard benchmark for intrinsic images. A number of methods use IIW to learn statistical dependencies between the images and their reflectance layer. Although learning plays an important role for high performance, we show that a standard signal processing technique achieves performance on par with current state-of-the-art. We propose a loss function for CNN learning of dense reflectance predictions. Our results show a simple pixel-wise decision, without any context or prior knowledge, is sufficient to provide a strong baseline on IIW. This sets a competitive baseline which only two other approaches surpass. We then develop a joint bilateral filtering method that implements strong prior knowledge about reflectance constancy. This filtering operation can be applied to any intrinsic image algorithm and we improve several previous results achieving a new state-of-the-art on IIW. Our findings suggest that the effect of learning-based approaches may have been over-estimated so far. Explicit prior knowledge is still at least as important to obtain high performance in intrinsic image decompositions.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Nestmeyer_Reflectance_Adaptive_Filtering_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Thomas Nestmeyer, Peter V.

Reflection Removal Using Low-Rank Matrix Completion	The images taken through glass often capture a target transmitted scene as well as undesired reflected scenes. In this paper, we propose a low-rank matrix completion algorithm to remove reflection artifacts automatically from multiple glass images taken at slightly different camera locations. We assume that the transmitted scenes are more dominant than the reflected scenes in typical glass images. We first warp the multiple glass images to a reference image, where the gradients are consistent in the transmission images while the gradients are varying across the reflection images. Based on this observation, we compute a gradient reliability such that the pixels belonging to the salient edges of the transmission image are assigned high reliability. Then we suppress the gradients of the reflection images and recover the gradients of the transmission images only, by solving a low-rank matrix completion problem in gradient domain. We reconstruct an original transmission image using the resulting optimal gradient map. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm removes the reflection artifacts from glass images faithfully and outperforms the existing algorithms on typical glass images.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Han_Reflection_Removal_Using_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Byeong-Ju Han, Jae-Young Sim
Regressing Robust and Discriminative 3D Morphable Models With a Very Deep Neural Network	"The 3D shapes of faces are well known to be discriminative. Yet despite this, they are rarely used for face recognition and always under controlled viewing conditions. We claim that this is a symptom of a serious but often overlooked problem with existing methods for single view 3D face reconstruction: when applied ""in the wild"", their 3D estimates are either unstable and change for different photos of the same subject or they are over-regularized and generic. In response, we describe a robust method for regressing discriminative 3D morphable face models (3DMM). We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to regress 3DMM shape and texture parameters directly from an input photo. We overcome the shortage of training data required for this purpose by offering a method for generating huge numbers of labeled examples. The 3D estimates produced by our CNN surpass state of the art accuracy on the MICC data set. Coupled with a 3D-3D face matching pipeline, we show the first competitive face recognition results on the LFW, YTF and IJB-A benchmarks using 3D face shapes as representations, rather than the opaque deep feature vectors used by other modern systems."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tran_Regressing_Robust_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Anh Tuan Tran, Tal Hassner, Iacopo Masi, Gerard Medioni
Relationship Proposal Networks	Image scene understanding requires learning the relationships between objects in the scene. A scene with many objects may have only a few individual interacting objects (e.g., in a party image with many people, only a handful of people might be speaking with each other). To detect all relationships, it would be inefficient to first detect all individual objects and then classify all pairs; not only is the number of all pairs quadratic, but classification requires limited object categories, which is not scalable for real-world images. In this paper we address these challenges by using pairs of related regions in images to train a relationship proposer that at test time produces a manageable number of related regions. We name our model the Relationship Proposal Network (Rel-PN). Like object proposals, our Rel-PN is class-agnostic and thus scalable to an open vocabulary of objects. We demonstrate the ability of our Rel-PN to localize relationships with only a few thousand proposals. We demonstrate its performance on the Visual Genome dataset and compare to other baselines that we designed. We also conduct experiments on a smaller subset of 5,000 images with over 37,000 related regions and show promising results.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Relationship_Proposal_Networks_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ji Zhang, Mohamed Elhoseiny, Scott Cohen, Walter Chang, Ahmed Elgammal
Reliable Crowdsourcing and Deep Locality-Preserving Learning for Expression Recognition in the Wild	Past research on facial expressions have used relatively limited datasets, which makes it unclear whether current methods can be employed in real world. In this paper, we present a novel database, RAF-DB, which contains about 30000 facial images from thousands of individuals. Each image has been individually labeled about 40 times, then EM algorithm was used to filter out unreliable labels. Crowdsourcing reveals that real-world faces often express compound emotions, or even mixture ones. For all we know, RAF-DB is the first database that contains compound expressions in the wild. Our cross-database study shows that the action units of basic emotions in RAF-DB are much more diverse than, or even deviate from, those of lab-controlled ones. To address this problem, we propose a new DLP-CNN (Deep Locality-Preserving CNN) method, which aims to enhance the discriminative power of deep features by preserving the locality closeness while maximizing the inter-class scatters. The benchmark experiments on the 7-class basic expressions and 11-class compound expressions, as well as the additional experiments on SFEW and CK+ databases, show that the proposed DLP-CNN outperforms the state-of-the-art handcrafted features and deep learning based methods for the expression recognition in the wild.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Li_Reliable_Crowdsourcing_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shan Li, Weihong Deng, JunPing Du
Removing Rain From Single Images via a Deep Detail Network	We propose a new deep network architecture for removing rain streaks from individual images based on the deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Inspired by the deep residual network (ResNet) that simplifies the learning process by changing the mapping form, we propose a deep detail network to directly reduce the mapping range from input to output, which makes the learning process easier. To further improve the de-rained result, we use a priori image domain knowledge by focusing on high frequency detail during training, which removes background interference and focuses the model on the structure of rain in images. This demonstrates that a deep architecture not only has benefits for high-level vision tasks but also can be used to solve low-level imaging problems. Though we train the network on synthetic data, we find that the learned network generalizes well to real-world test images. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world images in terms of both qualitative and quantitative measures. We discuss applications of this structure to denoising and JPEG artifact reduction at the end of the paper.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Fu_Removing_Rain_From_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xueyang Fu, Jiabin Huang, Delu Zeng, Yue Huang, Xinghao Ding, John Paisley
ResNet-Based Vehicle Classification and Localization in Traffic Surveillance Systems	In this paper, we present ResNet-based vehicle classification and localization methods using real traffic surveillance recordings. We utilize a MIOvision traffic dataset, which comprises 11 categories including a variety of vehicles, such as bicycle, bus, car, motorcycle, and so on. To improve the classification performance, we exploit a technique called joint fine-tuning (JF). In addition, we propose a dropping CNN (DropCNN) method to create a synergy effect with the JF. For the localization, we implement basic concepts of state-of-the-art region based detector combined with a backbone convolutional feature extractor using 50 and 101 layers of residual networks and ensemble them into a single model. Finally, we achieved the highest accuracy in both classification and localization tasks using the dataset among several state-of-the-art methods, including VGG16, AlexNet, and ResNet50 for the classification, and YOLO Faster R-CNN, and SSD for the localization reported on the website.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w9/html/Jung_ResNet-Based_Vehicle_Classification_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Heechul Jung, Min-Kook Choi, Jihun Jung, Jin-Hee Lee, Soon Kwon, Woo Young Jung
Residual Attention Network for Image Classification	"In this work, we propose ""Residual Attention Network"", a convolutional neural network using attention mechanism which can incorporate with state-of-art feed forward network architecture in an end-to-end training fashion. Our Residual Attention Network is built by stacking Attention Modules which generate attention-aware features. The attention-aware features from different modules change adaptively as layers going deeper. Inside each Attention Module, bottom-up top-down feedforward structure is used to unfold the feedforward and feedback attention process into a single feedforward process. Importantly, we propose attention residual learning to train very deep Residual Attention Networks which can be easily scaled up to hundreds of layers. Extensive analyses are conducted on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets to verify the effectiveness of every module mentioned above. Our Residual Attention Network achieves state-of-the-art object recognition performance on three benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10 (3.90% error), CIFAR-100 (20.45% error) and ImageNet (4.8% single model and single crop, top-5 error).

Unlike most existing nonconvex optimization techniques, the RE algorithm is not based on either stochastic or multi-point searches; therefore, it can achieve fast global optimization. Moreover, the RE algorithm is easy to implement and successful in high-dimensional optimization.

Revisiting Metric Learning for SPD Matrix Based Visual Representation	"The success of many visual recognition tasks largely depends on a good similarity measure, and distance metric learning plays an important role in this regard. Meanwhile, Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix is receiving increased attention for feature representation in multiple computer vision applications. However, distance metric learning on SPD matrices has not been sufficiently researched. A few existing works approached this by learning either d^2 xp or d xk transformation matrix for dxd SPD matrices. Different from these methods, this paper proposes a new member to the family of distance metric learning for SPD matrices. It learns only d parameters to adjust the eigenvalues of the SPD matrices through an efficient optimisation scheme. Also, it is shown that the proposed method can be interpreted as learning a sample-specific transformation matrix, instead of the fixed transformation matrix learned for all the samples in the existing works. The optimised d parameters can be used to ""massage"" the SPD matrices for better discrimination while still keeping them in the original space. From this perspective, the proposed method complements, rather than competes with, the existing linear-transformation-based methods, as the latter can always be applied to the output of the former to perform distance metric learning in further. The proposed method has been tested on multiple SPD-based visual representation data sets used in the literature, and the results demonstrate its interesting properties and attractive performance."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhou_Revisiting_Metric_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Luping Zhou, Lei Wang, Jianjia Zhang, Yinghuan Shi, Yang Gao
Revisiting the Variable Projection Method for Separable Nonlinear Least Squares Problems	Variable Projection (VarPro) is a framework to solve optimization problems efficiently by optimally eliminating a subset of the unknowns. It is in particular adapted for Separable Nonlinear Least Squares (SNLS) problems, a class of optimization problems including low-rank matrix factorization with missing data and affine bundle adjustment as instances. VarPro-based methods have received much attention over the last decade due to the experimentally observed large convergence basin for certain problem classes, where they have a clear advantage over standard methods based on Joint optimization over all unknowns. Yet no clear answers have been found in the literature as to why VarPro outperforms others and why Joint optimization, which has been successful in solving many computer vision tasks, fails on this type of problems. Also, the fact that VarPro has been mainly tested on small to medium-sized datasets has raised questions about its scalability. This paper intends to address these unsolved puzzles.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Hong_Revisiting_the_Variable_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Je Hyeong Hong, Christopher Zach, Andrew Fitzgibbon
Richardson-Lucy Deblurring for Moving Light Field Cameras	We generalize Richardson-Lucy (RL) deblurring to 4-D light fields by replacing the convolution steps with light field rendering of motion blur. The method deals correctly with blur caused by 6-degree-of-freedom camera motion in complex 3-D scenes, without performing depth estimation. We introduce a novel regularization term that maintains parallax information in the light field while reducing noise and ringing. We demonstrate the method operating effectively on rendered scenes and scenes captured using an off-the-shelf light field camera. An industrial robot arm provides repeatable and known trajectories, allowing us to establish quantitative performance in complex 3-D scenes. Qualitative and quantitative results confirm the effectiveness of the method, including commonly occurring cases for which previously published methods fail. We include mathematical proof that the algorithm converges to the maximum-likelihood estimate of the unblurred scene under Poisson noise. We expect extension to blind methods to be possible following the generalization of 2-D Richardson-Lucy to blind deconvolution.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w27/html/Dansereau_Richardson-Lucy_Deblurring_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Donald G.

Richer Convolutional Features for Edge Detection	In this paper, we propose an accurate edge detector using richer convolutional features (RCF). Since objects in natural images possess various scales and aspect ratios, learning the rich hierarchical representations is very critical for edge detection. CNNs have been proved to be effective for this task. In addition, the convolutional features in CNNs gradually become coarser with the increase of the receptive fields. According to these observations, we attempt to adopt richer convolutional features in such a challenging vision task. The proposed network fully exploits multiscale and multilevel information of objects to perform the image-to-image prediction by combining all the meaningful convolutional features in a holistic manner. Using VGG16 network, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on several available datasets. When evaluating on the well-known BSDS500 benchmark, we achieve ODS F-measure of 0.811 while retaining a fast speed (8 FPS). Besides, our fast version of RCF achieves ODS F-measure of 0.806 with 30 FPS.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Liu_Richer_Convolutional_Features_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yun Liu, Ming-Ming Cheng, Xiaowei Hu, Kai Wang, Xiang Bai
Riemannian Nonlinear Mixed Effects Models: Analyzing Longitudinal Deformations in Neuroimaging	"Statistical machine learning models that operate on manifold-valued data are being extensively studied in vision, motivated by applications in activity recognition, feature tracking and medical imaging. While non-parametric methods have been relatively well studied in the literature, efficient formulations for parametric models (which may offer benefits in small sample size regimes) have only emerged recently. So far, manifold-valued regression models (such as geodesic regression) are restricted to the analysis of cross-sectional data, i.e., the so-called ""fixed effects"" in statistics. But in most ""longitudinal analysis"" (e.g., when a participant provides multiple measurements, over time) the application of fixed effects models is problematic. In an effort to answer this need, this paper generalizes non-linear mixed effects model to the regime where the response variable is manifold-valued, i.e., f:R^d -> M. We derive the underlying model and estimation schemes and demonstrate the immediate benefits such a model can provide --- both for group level and individual level analysis --- on longitudinal brain imaging data. The direct consequence of our results is that longitudinal analysis of manifold-valued measurements (especially, the symmetric positive definite manifold) can be conducted in a computationally tractable manner."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kim_Riemannian_Nonlinear_Mixed_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hyunwoo J.

Riemannian Variance Filtering: An Independent Filtering Scheme for Statistical Tests on Manifold-Valued Data	"Performing large scale hypothesis testing on brain imaging data to identify group-wise differences (e.g., between healty and diseased subjects) typically leads to a large number of tests (one per voxel). Multiple testing adjustment (or correction) is necessary to control false positives, which may lead to lower detection power in detecting true positives. Motivated by the use of so-called ""independent filtering"" techniques in statistics (for genomics applications), this paper investigates the use of independent filtering for manifold-valued data (Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Cauchy Deformation Tensors) which are broadly used in neuroimaging studies Inspired by the concept of variance of a Riemannian Gaussian distribution, a type of non-specific data-dependent Riemannian variance filter is proposed.

Robocodes: Towards Generative Street Addresses From Satellite Imagery	We describe our automatic generative algorithm to create street addresses (Robocodes) from satellite images by learning and labeling regions, roads, and blocks. 75% of the world lacks street addresses. According to the United Nations, this means 4 billion people are 'invisible'. Recent initiatives tend to name unknown areas by geocoding, which uses latitude and longitude information. Nevertheless settlements abut roads and such addressing schemes are not coherent with the road topology. Instead, our algorithm starts with extracting roads and junctions from satellite imagery utilizing deep learning. Then, it uniquely labels the regions, roads, and houses using some graph- and proximity-based algorithms. We present our results on both cities in mapped areas and in developing countries. We also compare productivity based on current ad-hoc and new complete addresses. We conclude with contrasting our generative addresses to current industrial and open solutions.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w18/html/Demir_Robocodes_Towards_Generative_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ilke Demir, Forest Hughes, Aman Raj, Kleovoulos Tsourides, Divyaa Ravichandran, Suryanarayana Murthy, Kaunil Dhruv, Sanyam Garg, Jatin Malhotra, Barrett Doo, Grace Kermani, Ramesh Raskar
Robust Energy Minimization for BRDF-Invariant Shape From Light Fields	Highly effective optimization frameworks have been developed for traditional multiview stereo relying on lambertian photoconsistency. However, they do not account for complex material properties. On the other hand, recent works have explored PDE invariants for shape recovery with complex BRDFs, but they have not been incorporated into robust numerical optimization frameworks. We present a variational energy minimization framework for robust recovery of shape in multiview stereo with complex, unknown BRDFs. While our formulation is general, we demonstrate its efficacy on shape recovery using a single light field image, where the microlens array may be considered as a realization of a purely translational multiview stereo setup. Our formulation automatically balances contributions from texture gradients, traditional Lambertian photoconsistency, an appropriate BRDF-invariant PDE and a smoothness prior. Unlike prior works, our energy function inherently handles spatially-varying BRDFs and albedos. Extensive experiments with synthetic and real data show that our optimization framework consistently achieves errors lower than Lambertian baselines and further, is more robust than prior BRDF-invariant reconstruction methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Li_Robust_Energy_Minimization_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhengqin Li, Zexiang Xu, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Manmohan Chandraker
Robust FEC-CNN: A High Accuracy Facial Landmark Detection System	Facial landmark detection is a typical and crucial task in computer vision widely used in face recognition, facial expression analysis, etc. In this work, we propose an effective facial landmark detection system, recorded as Robust FEC-CNN (RFC), which achieves impressive results on facial landmark detection in the wild. Considering the favorable ability of deep convolutional neural network, we resort to FEC-CNN as a basic method to characterize the complex nonlinearity from face appearance to shape. Moreover, face bounding box invariant technique is adopted to reduce the landmark localization sensitivity to the face detector while model ensemble strategy is adopted to further enhance the landmark localization performance. We participate the Menpo Facial Landmark Localisation in-the-Wild Challenge and our RFC significantly outperforms the baseline approach APS. Extensive experiments on Menpo Challenge dataset and IBUG dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed RFC.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w33/html/He_Robust_FEC-CNN_A_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhenliang He, Jie Zhang, Meina Kan, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen
Robust Hand Detection and Classification in Vehicles and in the Wild	Robust hand detection and classification is one of the most crucial pre-processing steps to support human computer interaction, driver behaviors monitoring, virtual reality, etc. This problem, however, is very challenging due to numerous variants of hand images in real-world scenarios. This work presents a novel approach named Multiple Scale Region-based Fully Convolutional Networks (MS-RFCN) to robustly detect and classify human hand regions under various challenging conditions, e.g. occlusions, illumination, low-resolutions. In this approach, the whole image is passed through the proposed fully convolutional network to compute score maps. Those score maps with their position-sensitive properties can help to efficiently address a dilemma between translation-invariance in classification and detection. The method is evaluated on the challenging hand databases, i.e. the Vision for Intelligent Vehicles and Applications (VIVA) Challenge, Oxford hand dataset and compared against various recent hand detection methods. The experimental results show that our proposed MS-FRCN approach consistently achieves the state-of-the-art hand detection results, i.e. Average Precision (AP) / Average Recall (AR) of 95.1% / 94.5% at level 1 and 86.0% / 83.4% at level 2, on the VIVA challenge. In addition, the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results for left/right hand and driver/passenger classification tasks on the VIVA database with a significant improvement on AP/AR of 7% and 13% for both classification tasks, respectively. The hand detection performance of MS-RFCN reaches to 75.1% of AP and 77.8% of AR on Oxford database.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w13/html/Le_Robust_Hand_Detection_CVPR_2017_paper.html	T.

Robust Interpolation of Correspondences for Large Displacement Optical Flow	The interpolation of correspondences (EpicFlow) was widely used for optical flow estimation in most-recent works. It has the advantage of edge-preserving and efficiency. However, it is vulnerable to input matching noise, which is inevitable in modern matching techniques. In this paper, we present a Robust Interpolation method of Correspondences (called RicFlow) to overcome the weakness. First, the scene is over-segmented into superpixels to revitalize an early idea of piecewise flow model. Then, each model is estimated robustly from its support neighbors based on a graph constructed on superpixels. We propose a propagation mechanism among the pieces in the estimation of models. The propagation of models is significantly more efficient than the independent estimation of each model, yet retains the accuracy. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that RicFlow is more robust than EpicFlow, and it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Hu_Robust_Interpolation_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yinlin Hu, Yunsong Li, Rui Song
Robust Joint and Individual Variance Explained	Discovering the common (joint) and individual subspaces is crucial for analysis of multiple data sets, including multi-view and multi-modal data. Several statistical machine learning methods have been developed for discovering the common features across multiple data sets. The most well studied family of the methods is that of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and its variants. Even though the CCA is a powerful tool, it has several drawbacks that render its application challenging for computer vision applications. That is, it discovers only common features and not individual ones, and it is sensitive to gross errors present in visual data. Recently, efforts have been made in order to develop methods that discover individual and common components. Nevertheless, these methods are mainly applicable in two sets of data. In this paper, we investigate the use of a recently proposed statistical method, the so-called Joint and Individual Variance Explained (JIVE) method, for the recovery of joint and individual components in an arbitrary number of data sets. Since, the JIVE is not robust to gross errors, we propose alternatives, which are both robust to non-Gaussian noise of large magnitude, as well as able to automatically find the rank of the individual components. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to two computer vision applications, namely facial expression synthesis and face age progression in-the-wild.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Sagonas_Robust_Joint_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Christos Sagonas, Yannis Panagakis, Alina Leidinger, Stefanos Zafeiriou
Robust Verification With Subsurface Fingerprint Recognition Using Full Field Optical Coherence Tomography	Fingerprint recognition has been extensively used in number of civilian applications ranging from border control to everyday identity verification. The threats to current systems emerge from two facts that can be attributed to loss in accuracy due to damaged external fingerprint and attacks on the sensors by creation of the artefacts simply by lifting the latent fingerprints. In the growing necessity for secure biometric systems that are based on fingerprinting, new generation sensors have been investigated which can image the subsurface fingerprint. In this work, we explore the subsurface fingerprint imaging by employing a custom-built in-house Full-Field Optical Coherent Tomography (FF-OCT) sensor for capturing the subsurface fingerprint. Further, we evaluate a newly constructed database of 200 unique fingerprint samples collected in 2 different sessions with 6 layers of fingerprints image corresponding to 6 subsurface fingerprints. We also propose a framework based on quality metrics to fuse the subsurface fingerprint images to achieve a robust verification accuracy which has resulted in Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0%. We also provide an extensive set of experiments to gauge the reliability of subsurface fingerprints and deduce the set of important conclusions for path forward in FF-OCT subsurface fingerprint imaging.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w6/html/Raja_Robust_Verification_With_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Kiran B.

Robust Visual Tracking Using Oblique Random Forests	Random forest has emerged as a powerful classification technique with promising results in various vision tasks including image classification, pose estimation and object detection. However, current techniques have shown little improvements in visual tracking as they mostly rely on piece wise orthogonal hyperplanes to create decision nodes and lack a robust incremental learning mechanism that is much needed for online tracking. In this paper, we propose a discriminative tracker based on a novel incremental oblique random forest. Unlike conventional orthogonal decision trees that use a single feature and heuristic measures to obtain a split at each node, we propose to use a more powerful proximal SVM to obtain oblique hyperplanes to capture the geometric structure of the data better. The resulting decision surface is not restricted to be axis aligned and hence has the ability to represent and classify the input data better. Furthermore, in order to generalize to online tracking scenarios, we derive incremental update steps that enable the hyperplanes in each node to be updated recursively, efficiently and in a closed-form fashion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using two large scale benchmark datasets (OTB-51 and OTB-100) and show that our method gives competitive results on several challenging cases by relying on simple HOG features as well as in combination with more sophisticated deep neural network based models. The implementations of the proposed random forest are available at https://github.com/ZhangLeUestc/ Incremental-Oblique-Random-Forest.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Robust_Visual_Tracking_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Le Zhang, Jagannadan Varadarajan, Ponnuthurai Nagaratnam Suganthan, Narendra Ahuja, Pierre Moulin
S2F: Slow-To-Fast Interpolator Flow	We introduce a method to compute optical flow at multiple scales of motion, without resorting to multi- resolution or combinatorial methods. It addresses the key problem of small objects moving fast, and resolves the artificial binding between how large an object is and how fast it can move before being diffused away by clas- sical scale-space. Even with no learning, it achieves top performance on the most challenging optical flow benchmark. Moreover, the results are interpretable, and indeed we list the assumptions underlying our method explicitly. The key to our approach is the matching pro- gression from slow to fast, as well as the choice of in- terpolation method, or equivalently the prior, to fill in regions where the data allows it. We use several off- the-shelf components, with relatively low sensitivity to parameter tuning. Computational cost is comparable to the state-of-the-art.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yang_S2F_Slow-To-Fast_Interpolator_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yanchao Yang, Stefano Soatto
S3Pool: Pooling With Stochastic Spatial Sampling	Feature pooling layers (e.g., max pooling) in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) serve the dual purpose of providing increasingly abstract representations as well as yielding computational savings in subsequent convolutional layers. We view the pooling operation in CNNs as a two step procedure: first, a pooling window (e.g., 2x2) slides over the feature map with stride one which leaves the spatial resolution intact, and second, downsampling is performed by selecting one pixel from each non-overlapping pooling window in an often uniform and deterministic (e.g., top-left) manner. Our starting point in this work is the observation that this regularly spaced downsampling arising from non-overlapping windows, although intuitive from a signal processing perspective (which has the goal of signal reconstruction), is not necessarily optimal for learning (where the goal is to generalize). We study this aspect and propose a novel pooling strategy with stochastic spatial sampling (S3Pool), where the regular downsampling is replaced by a more general stochastic version. We observe that this general stochasticity acts as a strong regularizer, and can also be seen as doing implicit data augmentation by introducing distortions in the feature maps. We further introduce a mechanism to control the amount of distortion to suit different datasets and architectures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we perform extensive experiments on several popular image classification benchmarks, observing excellent improvements over baseline models.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhai_S3Pool_Pooling_With_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shuangfei Zhai, Hui Wu, Abhishek Kumar, Yu Cheng, Yongxi Lu, Zhongfei Zhang, Rogerio Feris
SANet: Structure-Aware Network for Visual Tracking	Convolutional neural network (CNN) has drawn increasing interest in visual tracking owing to its powerfulness in feature extraction. Most existing CNN-based trackers treat tracking as a classification problem. However, these trackers are sensitive to similar distractors because their CNN models mainly focus on inter-class classification. To address this problem, we use self-structure information of object to distinguish it from distractors. Specifically, we utilize recurrent neural network (RNN) to model object structure, and incorporate it into CNN to improve its robustness to similar distractors. Considering that convolutional layers in different levels characterize the object from different perspectives, we use multiple RNNs to model object structure in different levels respectively. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks, OTB100, TC-128 and VOT2015, show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other methods. Code is released at www.dabi.temple.edu/hbling/code/SANet/SANet.html.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w37/html/Fan_SANet_Structure-Aware_Network_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Heng Fan, Haibin Ling
SCA-CNN: Spatial and Channel-Wise Attention in Convolutional Networks for Image Captioning	Visual attention has been successfully applied in structural prediction tasks such as visual captioning and question answering. Existing visual attention models are generally spatial, i.e., the attention is modeled as spatial probabilities that re-weight the last conv-layer feature map of a CNN encoding an input image. However, we argue that such spatial attention does not necessarily conform to the attention mechanism --- a dynamic feature extractor that combines contextual fixations over time, as CNN features are naturally spatial, channel-wise and multi-layer. In this paper, we introduce a novel convolutional neural network dubbed SCA-CNN that incorporates Spatial and Channel-wise Attentions in a CNN. In the task of image captioning, SCA-CNN dynamically modulates the sentence generation context in multi-layer feature maps, encoding where (i.e., attentive spatial locations at multiple layers) and what (i.e., attentive channels) the visual attention is. We evaluate the proposed SCA-CNN architecture on three benchmark image captioning datasets: Flickr8K, Flickr30K, and MSCOCO. It is consistently observed that SCA-CNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art visual attention-based image captioning methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chen_SCA-CNN_Spatial_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Long Chen, Hanwang Zhang, Jun Xiao, Liqiang Nie, Jian Shao, Wei Liu, Tat-Seng Chua
SCC: Semantic Context Cascade for Efficient Action Detection	Despite the recent advances in large-scale video analysis, action detection remains as one of the most challenging unsolved problems in computer vision. This snag is in part due to the large volume of data that needs to be analyzed to detect actions in videos. Existing approaches have mitigated the computational cost, but still, these methods lack rich high-level semantics that helps them to localize the actions quickly. In this paper, we introduce a Semantic Cascade Context (SCC) model that aims to detect action in long video sequences. By embracing semantic priors associated with human activities, SCC produces high-quality class-specific action proposals and prune unrelated activities in a cascade fashion. Experimental results in ActivityNet unveils that SCC achieves state-of-the-art performance for action detection while operating at real time.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Heilbron_SCC_Semantic_Context_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Fabian Caba Heilbron, Wayner Barrios, Victor Escorcia, Bernard Ghanem
SGM-Nets: Semi-Global Matching With Neural Networks	This paper deals with deep neural networks for predicting accurate dense disparity map with Semi-global matching (SGM). SGM is a widely used regularization method for real scenes because of its high accuracy and fast computation speed. Even though SGM can obtain accurate results, tuning of SGM's penalty-parameters, which control a smoothness and discontinuity of a disparity map, is uneasy and empirical methods have been proposed. We propose a learning based penalties estimation method, which we call SGM-Nets that consist of Convolutional Neural Networks. A small image patch and its position are input into SGMNets to predict the penalties for the 3D object structures. In order to train the networks, we introduce a novel loss function which is able to use sparsely annotated disparity maps such as captured by a LiDAR sensor in real environments. Moreover, we propose a novel SGM parameterization, which deploys different penalties depending on either positive or negative disparity changes in order to represent the object structures more discriminatively. Our SGM-Nets outperformed state of the art accuracy on KITTI benchmark datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Seki_SGM-Nets_Semi-Global_Matching_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Akihito Seki, Marc Pollefeys
SPFTN: A Self-Paced Fine-Tuning Network for Segmenting Objects in Weakly Labelled Videos	Object segmentation in weakly labelled videos is an interesting yet challenging task, which aims at learning to perform category-specific video object segmentation by only using video-level tags. Existing works in this research area might still have some limitations, e.g., lack of effective DNN-based learning frameworks, under-exploring the context information, and requiring to leverage the unstable negative video collection, which prevent them from obtaining more promising performance. To this end, we propose a novel self-paced fine-tuning network (SPFTN)-based framework, which could learn to explore the context information within the video frames and capture adequate object semantics without using the negative videos. To perform weakly supervised learning based on the deep neural network, we make the earliest effort to integrate the self-paced learning regime and the deep neural network into a unified and compatible framework, leading to the self-paced fine-tuning network. Comprehensive experiments on the large-scale YouTube-Objects and DAVIS datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance as compared with other state-of-the-art methods as well as the baseline networks and models.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_SPFTN_A_Self-Paced_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Dingwen Zhang, Le Yang, Deyu Meng, Dong Xu, Junwei Han
SRHRF+: Self-Example Enhanced Single Image Super-Resolution Using Hierarchical Random Forests	Example-based single image super-resolution (SISR) methods use external training datasets and have recently attracted a lot of interest. Self-example based SISR methods exploit redundant non-local self-similar patterns in natural images and because of that are more able to adapt to the image at hand to generate high quality super-resolved images. In this paper, we propose to combine the advantages of example-based SISR and self-example based SISR. A novel hierarchical random forests based super-resolution (SRHRF) method is proposed to learn statistical priors from external training images. Each layer of random forests reduce the estimation error due to variance by aggregating prediction models from multiple decision trees. The hierarchical structure further boosts the performance by pushing the estimation error due to bias towards zero. In order to further adaptively improve the super-resolved image, a self-example random forests (SERF) is learned from an image pyramid pair constructed from the down-sampled SRHRF generated result. Extensive numerical results show that the SRHRF method enhanced using SERF (SRHRF+) achieves the state-of-the-art performance on natural images and yields substantially superior performance for image with rich self-similar patterns.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w12/html/Huang_SRHRF_Self-Example_Enhanced_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jun-Jie Huang, Tianrui Liu, Pier Luigi Dragotti, Tania Stathaki
SRN: Side-output Residual Network for Object Symmetry Detection in the Wild	In this paper, we establish a baseline for object symmetry detection in complex backgrounds by presenting a new benchmark and an end-to-end deep learning approach, opening up a promising direction for symmetry detection in the wild. The new benchmark, named Sym-PASCAL, spans challenges including object diversity, multi-objects, part-invisibility, and various complex backgrounds that are far beyond those in existing datasets. The proposed symmetry detection approach, named Side-output Residual Network (SRN), leverages output Residual Units (RUs) to fit the errors between the object symmetry ground-truth and the outputs of RUs. By stacking RUs in a deep-to-shallow manner, SRN exploits the 'flow' of errors among multiple scales to ease the problems of fitting complex outputs with limited layers, suppressing the complex backgrounds, and effectively matching object symmetry of different scales. Experimental results validate both the benchmark and its challenging aspects related to real-world images, and the state-of-the-art performance of our symmetry detection approach. The benchmark and the code for SRN are publicly available at https://github.com/KevinKecc/SRN.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ke_SRN_Side-output_Residual_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Wei Ke, Jie Chen, Jianbin Jiao, Guoying Zhao, Qixiang Ye
SST: Single-Stream Temporal Action Proposals	Our paper presents a new approach for temporal detection of human actions in long, untrimmed video sequences. We introduce Single-Stream Temporal Action Proposals (SST), a new effective and efficient deep architecture for the generation of temporal action proposals. Our network can run continuously in a single stream over very long input video sequences, without the need to divide input into short overlapping clips or temporal windows for batch processing. We demonstrate empirically that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art on the task of temporal action proposal generation, while achieving some of the fastest processing speeds in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate that using SST proposals in conjunction with existing action classifiers results in improved state-of-the-art temporal action detection performance.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Buch_SST_Single-Stream_Temporal_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shyamal Buch, Victor Escorcia, Chuanqi Shen, Bernard Ghanem, Juan Carlos Niebles
STD2P: RGBD Semantic Segmentation Using Spatio-Temporal Data-Driven Pooling	We propose a novel superpixel-based multi-view convolutional neural network for semantic image segmentation. The proposed network produces a high quality segmentation of a single image by leveraging information from additional views of the same scene. Particularly in indoor videos such as captured by robotic platforms or handheld and bodyworn RGBD cameras, nearby video frames provide diverse viewpoints and additional context of objects and scenes. To leverage such information, we first compute region correspondences by optical flow and image boundary-based superpixels. Given these region correspondences, we propose a novel spatio-temporal pooling layer to aggregate information over space and time. We evaluate our approach on the NYU-Depth-V2 and the SUN3D datasets and compare it to various state-of-the-art single-view and multi-view approaches. Besides a general improvement over the state-of-the-art, we also show the benefits of making use of unlabeled frames during training for multi-view as well as single-view prediction.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/He_STD2P_RGBD_Semantic_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yang He, Wei-Chen Chiu, Margret Keuper, Mario Fritz
Saliency Revisited: Analysis of Mouse Movements Versus Fixations	This paper revisits visual saliency prediction by evaluating the recent advancements in this field such as crowd-sourced mouse tracking-based databases and contextual annotations. We pursue a critical and quantitative approach towards some of the new challenges including the quality of mouse tracking versus eye tracking for model training and evaluation. We extend quantitative evaluation of models in order to incorporate contextual information by proposing an evaluation methodology that allows accounting for contextual factors such as text, faces, and object attributes. The proposed contextual evaluation scheme facilitates detailed analysis of models and helps identify their pros and cons. Through several experiments, we find that (1) mouse tracking data has lower inter-participant visual congruency and higher dispersion, compared to the eye tracking data, (2) mouse tracking data does not totally agree with eye tracking in general and in terms of different contextual regions in specific, and (3) mouse tracking data leads to acceptable results in training current existing models, and (4) mouse tracking data is less reliable for model selection and evaluation. The contextual evaluation also reveals that, among the studied models, there is no single model that performs best on all the tested annotations.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tavakoli_Saliency_Revisited_Analysis_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hamed R.

Scalable Person Re-Identification on Supervised Smoothed Manifold	Most existing person re-identification algorithms either extract robust visual features or learn discriminative metrics for person images. However, the underlying manifold which those images reside on is rarely investigated. That arises a problem that the learned metric is not smooth with respect to the local geometry structure of the data manifold. In this paper, we study person re-identification with manifold-based affinity learning, which did not receive enough attention from this area. An unconventional manifold-preserving algorithm is proposed, which can 1) make best use of supervision from training data, whose label information is given as pairwise constraints; 2) scale up to large repositories with low on-line time complexity; and 3) be plunged into most existing algorithms, serving as a generic postprocessing procedure to further boost the identification accuracies. Extensive experimental results on five popular person re-identification benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Especially, on the largest CUHK03 and Market-1501, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives by a large margin with high efficiency, which is more appropriate for practical applications.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Bai_Scalable_Person_Re-Identification_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Song Bai, Xiang Bai, Qi Tian
Scalable Surface Reconstruction From Point Clouds With Extreme Scale and Density Diversity	In this paper we present a scalable approach for robustly computing a 3D surface mesh from multi-scale multi-view stereo point clouds that can handle extreme jumps of point density (in our experiments three orders of magnitude). The backbone of our approach is a combination of octree data partitioning, local Delaunay tetrahedralization and graph cut optimization. Graph cut optimization is used twice, once to extract surface hypotheses from local Delaunay tetrahedralizations and once to merge overlapping surface hypotheses even when the local tetrahedralizations do not share the same topology. This formulation allows us to obtain a constant memory consumption per sub-problem while at the same time retaining the density independent interpolation properties of the Delaunay-based optimization. On multiple public datasets, we demonstrate that our approach is highly competitive with the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy, completeness and outlier resilience. Further, we demonstrate the multi-scale potential of our approach by processing a newly recorded dataset with 2 billion points and a point density variation of more than four orders of magnitude - requiring less than 9GB of RAM per process.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Mostegel_Scalable_Surface_Reconstruction_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Christian Mostegel, Rudolf Prettenthaler, Friedrich Fraundorfer, Horst Bischof
Scale-Aware Face Detection	Convolutional neural network (CNN) based face detectors are inefficient in handling faces of diverse scales. They rely on either fitting a large single model to faces across a large scale range or multi-scale testing. Both are computationally expensive. We propose Scale-aware Face Detection (SAFD) to handle scale explicitly using CNN, and achieve better performance with less computation cost. Prior to detection, an efficient CNN predicts the scale distribution histogram of the faces. Then the scale histogram guides the zoom-in and zoom-out of the image. Since the faces will be approximately in uniform scale after zoom, they can be detected accurately even with much smaller CNN. Actually, more than 99% of the faces in AFW can be covered with less than two zooms per image. Extensive experiments on FDDB, MALF and AFW show advantages of SAFD.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Hao_Scale-Aware_Face_Detection_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zekun Hao, Yu Liu, Hongwei Qin, Junjie Yan, Xiu Li, Xiaolin Hu
ScanNet: Richly-Annotated 3D Reconstructions of Indoor Scenes	A key requirement for leveraging supervised deep learning methods is the availability of large, labeled datasets. Unfortunately, in the context of RGB-D scene understanding, very little data is available -- current datasets cover a small range of scene views and have limited semantic annotations. To address this issue, we introduce ScanNet, an RGB-D video dataset containing 2.5M views in 1513 scenes annotated with 3D camera poses, surface reconstructions, and semantic segmentations. To collect this data, we designed an easy-to-use and scalable RGB-D capture system that includes automated surface reconstruction and crowdsourced semantic annotation. We show that using this data helps achieve state-of-the-art performance on several 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D object classification, semantic voxel labeling, and CAD model retrieval.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Dai_ScanNet_Richly-Annotated_3D_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Angela Dai, Angel X.

Scene Flow to Action Map: A New Representation for RGB-D Based Action Recognition With Convolutional Neural Networks	Scene flow describes the motion of 3D objects in real world and potentially could be the basis of a good feature for 3D action recognition. However, its use for action recognition, especially in the context of convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), has not been previously studied. In this paper, we propose the extraction and use of scene flow for action recognition from RGB-D data. Previous works have considered the depth and RGB modalities as separate channels and extract features for later fusion. We take a different approach and consider the modalities as one entity, thus allowing feature extraction for action recognition at the beginning. Two key questions about the use of scene flow for action recognition are addressed: how to organize the scene flow vectors and how to represent the long term dynamics of videos based on scene flow. In order to calculate the scene flow correctly on the available datasets, we propose an effective self-calibration method to align the RGB and depth data spatially without knowledge of the camera parameters. Based on the scene flow vectors, we propose a new representation, namely, Scene Flow to Action Map (SFAM), that describes several long term spatio-temporal dynamics for action recognition. We adopt a channel transform kernel to transform the scene flow vectors to an optimal color space analogous to RGB. This transformation takes better advantage of the trained ConvNets models over ImageNet. Experimental results indicate that this new representation can surpass the performance of state-of-the-art methods on two large public datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_Scene_Flow_to_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Pichao Wang, Wanqing Li, Zhimin Gao, Yuyao Zhang, Chang Tang, Philip Ogunbona
Scene Graph Generation by Iterative Message Passing	Understanding a visual scene goes beyond recognizing individual objects in isolation. Relationships between objects also constitute rich semantic information about the scene. In this work, we explicitly model the objects and their relationships using scene graphs, a visually-grounded graphical structure of an image. We propose a novel end-to-end model that generates such structured scene representation from an input image. Our key insight is that the graph generation problem can be formulated as message passing between the primal node graph and its dual edge graph. Our joint inference model can take advantage of contextual cues to make better predictions on objects and their relationships. The experiments show that our model significantly outperforms previous methods on the Visual Genome dataset as well as support relation inference in NYU Depth V2 dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xu_Scene_Graph_Generation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Danfei Xu, Yuke Zhu, Christopher B.

Scene Parsing Through ADE20K Dataset	Scene parsing, or recognizing and segmenting objects and stuff in an image, is one of the key problems in computer vision. Despite the community's efforts in data collection, there are still few image datasets covering a wide range of scenes and object categories with dense and detailed annotations for scene parsing. In this paper, we introduce and analyze the ADE20K dataset, spanning diverse annotations of scenes, objects, parts of objects, and in some cases even parts of parts. A scene parsing benchmark is built upon the ADE20K with 150 object and stuff classes included. Several segmentation baseline models are evaluated on the benchmark. A novel network design called Cascade Segmentation Module is proposed to parse a scene into stuff, objects, and object parts in a cascade and improve over the baselines. We further show that the trained scene parsing networks can lead to applications such as image content removal and scene synthesis(Dataset and pretrained models are available at http://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/datasets/ADE20K/).	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhou_Scene_Parsing_Through_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Bolei Zhou, Hang Zhao, Xavier Puig, Sanja Fidler, Adela Barriuso, Antonio Torralba
Scene-Text-Detection Method Robust Against Orientation and Discontiguous Components of Characters	Scene-text detection in natural-scene images is an important technique because scene texts contain location information such as names of places and buildings, but many difficulties still remain regarding practical use. In this paper, we tackle two problems of scene-text detection. The first is the discontiguous component problem in specific languages that contain characters consisting of discontiguous components. The second is the multi-orientation problem in all languages. To solve these two problems, we propose a connected-component-based scene-text-detection method. Our proposed method involves our novel neighbor-character search method using a synthesizable descriptor for the discontiguous-component problems and our novel region descriptor called the rotated bounding box descriptors (RBBs) for rotated characters. We also evaluated our proposed scene-text-detection method by using the well-known MSRA-TD500 dataset that includes rotated characters with discontiguous components.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w10/html/Endo_Scene-Text-Detection_Method_Robust_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Rei Endo, Yoshihiko Kawai, Hideki Sumiyoshi, Masanori Sano
Scribbler: Controlling Deep Image Synthesis With Sketch and Color	Recently, there have been several promising methods to generate realistic imagery from deep convolutional networks. These methods sidestep the traditional computer graphics rendering pipeline and instead generate imagery at the pixel level by learning from large collections of photos (e.g. faces or bedrooms). However, these methods are of limited utility because it is difficult for a user to control what the network produces. In this paper, we propose a deep adverserial image synthesis architecture that is conditioned on coarse sketches and sparse color strokes to generate realistic cars, bedrooms, or faces. We demonstrate a sketch based image synthesis system which allows users to 'scribble' over the sketch to indicate preferred color for objects. Our network can then generate convincing images that satisfy both the color and the sketch constraints of user. The network is feed-forward which allows users to see the effect of their edits in real time. We compare to recent work on sketch to image synthesis and show that our approach can generate more realistic, more diverse, and more controllable outputs. The architecture is also effective at user-guided colorization of grayscale images.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Sangkloy_Scribbler_Controlling_Deep_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Patsorn Sangkloy, Jingwan Lu, Chen Fang, Fisher Yu, James Hays
See the Forest for the Trees: Joint Spatial and Temporal Recurrent Neural Networks for Video-Based Person Re-Identification	Surveillance cameras have been widely used in different scenes. Accordingly, a demanding need is to recognize a person under different cameras, which is called person re-identification. This topic has gained increasing interests in computer vision recently. However, less attention has been paid to video-based approaches, compared with image-based ones. Two steps are usually involved in previous approaches, namely feature learning and metric learning. But most of the existing approaches only focus on either feature learning or metric learning. Meanwhile, many of them do not take full use of the temporal and spatial information. In this paper, we concentrate on video-based person re-identification and build an end-to-end deep neural network architecture to jointly learn features and metrics. The proposed method can automatically pick out the most discriminative frames in a given video by a temporal attention model. Moreover, it integrates the surrounding information at each location by a spatial recurrent model when measuring the similarity with another pedestrian video. That is, our method handles spatial and temporal information simultaneously in a unified manner. The carefully designed experiments on three public datasets show the effectiveness of each component of the proposed deep network, performing better in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhou_See_the_Forest_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhen Zhou, Yan Huang, Wei Wang, Liang Wang, Tieniu Tan
Seeing Into Darkness: Scotopic Visual Recognition	Images are formed by counting how many photons traveling from a given set of directions hit an image sensor during a given time interval. When photons are few and far in between, the concept of `image' breaks down and it is best to consider directly the flow of photons. Computer vision in this regime, which we call `scotopic', is radically different from the classical image-based paradigm in that visual computations (classification, control, search) have to take place while the stream of photons is captured and decisions may be taken as soon as enough information is available. The scotopic regime is important for biomedical imaging, security, astronomy and many other fields. Here we develop a framework that allows a machine to classify objects with as few photons as possible, while maintaining the error rate below an acceptable threshold. A dynamic and asymptotically optimal speed-accuracy tradeoff is a key feature of this framework. We propose and study an algorithm to optimize the tradeoff of a convolutional network directly from lowlight images and evaluate on simulated images from standard datasets. Surprisingly, scotopic systems can achieve comparable classification performance as traditional vision systems while using less than 0.1% of the photons in a conventional image. In addition, we demonstrate that our algorithms work even when the illuminance of the environment is unknown and varying. Last, we outline a spiking neural network coupled with photon-counting sensors as a power-efficient hardware realization of scotopic algorithms.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chen_Seeing_Into_Darkness_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Bo Chen, Pietro Perona
Seeing Invisible Poses: Estimating 3D Body Pose From Egocentric Video	"Understanding the camera wearer's activity is central to egocentric vision, yet one key facet of that activity is inherently invisible to the camera--the wearer's body pose. Prior work focuses on estimating the pose of hands and arms when they come into view, but this 1) gives an incomplete view of the full body posture, and 2) prevents any pose estimate at all in many frames, since the hands are only visible in a fraction of daily life activities. We propose to infer the ""invisible pose"" of a person behind the egocentric camera. Given a single video, our efficient learning-based approach returns the full body 3D joint positions for each frame. Our method exploits cues from the dynamic motion signatures of the surrounding scene--which change predictably as a function of body pose--as well as static scene structures that reveal the viewpoint (e.g., sitting vs. standing). We further introduce a novel energy minimization scheme to infer the pose sequence. It uses soft predictions of the poses per time instant together with a non-parametric model of human pose dynamics over longer windows. Our method outperforms an array of possible alternatives, including typical deep learning approaches for direct pose regression from images."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Jiang_Seeing_Invisible_Poses_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hao Jiang, Kristen Grauman
Seeing What Is Not There: Learning Context to Determine Where Objects Are Missing	Most of computer vision focuses on what is in an image. We propose to train a standalone object-centric context representation to perform the opposite task: seeing what is not there. Given an image, our context model can predict where objects should exist, even when no object instances are present. Combined with object detection results, we can perform a novel vision task: finding where objects are missing in an image. Our model is based on a convolutional neural network structure. With a specially designed training strategy, the model learns to ignore objects and focus on context only. It is fully convolutional thus highly efficient. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in one important accessibility task: finding city street regions where curb ramps are missing, which could help millions of people with mobility disabilities.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Sun_Seeing_What_Is_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jin Sun, David W.

Selecting an Optimized COTS Filter Set for Multispectral Plenoptic Sensing	A 16-band plenoptic camera allows for the rapid exchange of filter sets via a 4x4 filter array on the lens's front aperture thus allowing an operator to quickly adapt to a different locale or threat intelligence. Typically, such a system incorporates a default set of 16 equally spaced, non-overlapping, flat-topped filters. Knowing the operating theater or the likely targets of interest it becomes advantageous to tune the filters; we propose a differential evolution algorithm to search over a set of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) filters for an optimal solution. We examine two independent tasks: general spectral sensing and target detection. For general spectral sensing, we utilize compressive sensing and find filters that generate codings which minimize reconstruction error. For target detection, we select the filters to optimize the separation between the background and a set of targets. We compare our results to the default filter set and full spectral resolution hyperspectral data.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w3/html/Doster_Selecting_an_Optimized_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Timothy Doster, Colin C.

Self-Calibration-Based Approach to Critical Motion Sequences of Rolling-Shutter Structure From Motion	"In this paper we consider critical motion sequences (CMSs) of rolling-shutter (RS) SfM. Employing an RS camera model with linearized pure rotation, we show that the RS distortion can be approximately expressed by two internal parameters of an ""imaginary"" camera plus one-parameter nonlinear transformation similar to lens distortion. We then reformulate the problem as self-calibration of the imaginary camera, in which its skew and aspect ratio are unknown and varying in the image sequence. In the formulation, we derive a general representation of CMSs. We also show that our method can explain the CMS that was recently reported in the literature, and then present a new remedy to deal with the degeneracy. Our theoretical results agree well with experimental results; it explains degeneracies observed when we employ naive bundle adjustment, and how they are resolved by our method."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ito_Self-Calibration-Based_Approach_to_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Eisuke Ito, Takayuki Okatani
Self-Critical Sequence Training for Image Captioning	"Recently it has been shown that policy-gradient methods for reinforcement learning can be utilized to train deep end-to-end systems directly on non-differentiable metrics for the task at hand. In this paper we consider the problem of optimizing image captioning systems using reinforcement learning, and show that by carefully optimizing our systems using the test metrics of the MSCOCO task, significant gains in performance can be realized. Our systems are built using a new optimization approach that we call self-critical sequence training (SCST). SCST is a form of the popular REINFORCE algorithm that, rather than estimating a ""baseline"" to normalize the rewards and reduce variance, utilizes the output of its own test-time inference algorithm to normalize the rewards it experiences. Using this approach, estimating the reward signal (as actor-critic methods must do) and estimating normalization (as REINFORCE algorithms typically do) is avoided, while at the same time harmonizing the model with respect to its test-time inference procedure. Empirically we find that directly optimizing the CIDEr metric with SCST and greedy decoding at test-time is highly effective. Our results on the MSCOCO evaluation sever establish a new state-of-the-art on the task, improving the best result in terms of CIDEr from 104.9 to 114.7."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Rennie_Self-Critical_Sequence_Training_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Steven J.

Self-Learning Scene-Specific Pedestrian Detectors Using a Progressive Latent Model	In this paper, a self-learning approach is proposed towards solving scene-specific pedestrian detection problem without any human' annotation involved. The self-learning approach is deployed as progressive steps of object discovery, object enforcement, and label propagation. In the learning procedure, object locations in each frame are treated as latent variables that are solved with a progressive latent model (PLM). Compared with conventional latent models, the proposed PLM incorporates a spatial regularization term to reduce ambiguities in object proposals and to enforce object localization, and also a graph-based label propagation to discover harder instances in adjacent frames. With the difference of convex (DC) objective functions, PLM can be efficiently optimized with a concave-convex programming and thus guaranteeing the stability of self-learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that even without annotation the proposed self-learning approach outperforms weakly supervised learning approaches, while achieving comparable performance with transfer learning and fully supervised approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ye_Self-Learning_Scene-Specific_Pedestrian_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Qixiang Ye, Tianliang Zhang, Wei Ke, Qiang Qiu, Jie Chen, Guillermo Sapiro, Baochang Zhang
Self-Supervised Learning of Visual Features Through Embedding Images Into Text Topic Spaces	End-to-end training from scratch of current deep architectures for new computer vision problems would require Imagenet-scale datasets, and this is not always possible. In this paper we present a method that is able to take advantage of freely available multi-modal content to train computer vision algorithms without human supervision. We put forward the idea of performing self-supervised learning of visual features by mining a large scale corpus of multi-modal (text and image) documents. We show that discriminative visual features can be learnt efficiently by training a CNN to predict the semantic context in which a particular image is more probable to appear as an illustration. For this we leverage the hidden semantic structures discovered in the text corpus with a well-known topic modeling technique. Our experiments demonstrate state of the art performance in image classification, object detection, and multi-modal retrieval compared to recent self-supervised or natural-supervised approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Gomez_Self-Supervised_Learning_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Lluis Gomez, Yash Patel, Marcal Rusinol, Dimosthenis Karatzas, C.

Self-Supervised Neural Aggregation Networks for Human Parsing	"In this paper, we present a Self-Supervised Neural Aggregation Network (SS-NAN) for human parsing. SS-NAN adaptively learns to aggregate the multi-scale features at each pixel ""address"". In order to further improve the feature discriminative capacity, a self-supervised joint loss is adopted as an auxiliary learning strategy, which imposes human joint structures into parsing results without resorting to extra supervision. The proposed SS-NAN is end-to-end trainable. SS-NAN can be integrated into any advanced neural networks to help aggregate features regarding the importance at different positions and scales and incorporate rich high-level knowledge regarding human joint structures from a global perspective, which in turn improve the parsing results. Comprehensive evaluations on the recent Look into Person (LIP) and the PASCAL-Person-Part benchmark datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of our method over other state-of-the-arts."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w19/html/Zhao_Self-Supervised_Neural_Aggregation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jian Zhao, Jianshu Li, Xuecheng Nie, Fang Zhao, Yunpeng Chen, Zhecan Wang, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan
Self-Supervised Video Representation Learning With Odd-One-Out Networks	We propose a new self-supervised CNN pre-training technique based on a novel auxiliary task called odd-one-out learning. In this task, the machine is asked to identify the unrelated or odd element from a set of otherwise related elements. We apply this technique to self-supervised video representation learning where we sample subsequences from videos and ask the network to learn to predict the odd video subsequence. The odd video subsequence is sampled such that it has wrong temporal order of frames while the even ones have the correct temporal order. Therefore, to generate a odd-one-out question no manual annotation is required. Our learning machine is implemented as multi-stream convolutional neural network, which is learned end-to-end. Using odd-one-out networks, we learn temporal representations for videos that generalizes to other related tasks such as action recognition. On action classification, our method obtains 60.3% on the UCF101 dataset using only UCF101 data for training which is approximately 10% better than current state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods. Similarly, on HMDB51 dataset we outperform self-supervised state-of-the art methods by 12.7% on action classification task.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Fernando_Self-Supervised_Video_Representation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Basura Fernando, Hakan Bilen, Efstratios Gavves, Stephen Gould
Semantic Amodal Segmentation	Common visual recognition tasks such as classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation are rapidly reaching maturity, and given the recent rate of progress, it is not unreasonable to conjecture that techniques for many of these problems will approach human levels of performance in the next few years. In this paper we look to the future: what is the next frontier in visual recognition? We offer one possible answer to this question. We propose a detailed image annotation that captures information beyond the visible pixels and requires complex reasoning about full scene structure. Specifically, we create an amodal segmentation of each image: the full extent of each region is marked, not just the visible pixels. Annotators outline and name all salient regions in the image and specify a partial depth order. The result is a rich scene structure, including visible and occluded portions of each region, figure-ground edge information, semantic labels, and object overlap. We create two datasets for semantic amodal segmentation. First, we label 500 images in the BSDS dataset with multiple annotators per image, allowing us to study the statistics of human annotations. We show that the proposed full scene annotation is surprisingly consistent between annotators, including for regions and edges. Second, we annotate 5000 images from COCO. This larger dataset allows us to explore a number of algorithmic ideas for amodal segmentation and depth ordering. We introduce novel metrics for these tasks, and along with our strong baselines, define concrete new challenges for the community.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhu_Semantic_Amodal_Segmentation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yan Zhu, Yuandong Tian, Dimitris Metaxas, Piotr Dollar
Semantic Autoencoder for Zero-Shot Learning	Existing zero-shot learning (ZSL) models typically learn a projection function from a feature space to a semantic embedding space (e.g. attribute space). However, such a projection function is only concerned with predicting the training seen class semantic representation (e.g. attribute prediction) or classification. When applied to test data, which in the context of ZSL contains different (unseen) classes without training data, a ZSL model typically suffers from the project domain shift problem. In this work, we present a novel solution to ZSL based on learning a Semantic AutoEncoder (SAE). Taking the encoder-decoder paradigm, an encoder aims to project a visual feature vector into the semantic space as in the existing ZSL models. However, the decoder exerts an additional constraint, that is, the projection/code must be able to reconstruct the original visual feature. We show that with this additional reconstruction constraint, the learned projection function from the seen classes is able to generalise better to the new unseen classes. Importantly, the encoder and decoder are linear and symmetric which enable us to develop an extremely efficient learning algorithm. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SAE outperforms significantly the existing ZSL models with the additional benefit of lower computational cost. Furthermore, when the SAE is applied to supervised clustering problem, it also beats the state-of-the-art.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kodirov_Semantic_Autoencoder_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Elyor Kodirov, Tao Xiang, Shaogang Gong
Semantic Compositional Networks for Visual Captioning	A Semantic Compositional Network (SCN) is developed for image captioning, in which semantic concepts (i.e., tags) are detected from the image, and the probability of each tag is used to compose the parameters in a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The SCN extends each weight matrix of the LSTM to an ensemble of tag-dependent weight matrices. The degree to which each member of the ensemble is used to generate an image caption is tied to the image-dependent probability of the corresponding tag. In addition to captioning images, we also extend the SCN to generate captions for video clips. We qualitatively analyze semantic composition in SCNs, and quantitatively evaluate the algorithm on three benchmark datasets: COCO, Flickr30k, and Youtube2Text. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches, across multiple evaluation metrics.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Gan_Semantic_Compositional_Networks_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhe Gan, Chuang Gan, Xiaodong He, Yunchen Pu, Kenneth Tran, Jianfeng Gao, Lawrence Carin, Li Deng
Semantic Image Inpainting With Deep Generative Models	Semantic image inpainting is a challenging task where large missing regions have to be filled based on the available visual data. Existing methods which extract information from only a single image generally produce unsatisfactory results due to the lack of high level context. In this paper, we propose a novel method for semantic image inpainting, which generates the missing content by conditioning on the available data. Given a trained generative model, we search for the closest encoding of the corrupted image in the latent image manifold using our context and prior losses. This encoding is then passed through the generative model to infer the missing content. In our method, inference is possible irrespective of how the missing content is structured, while the state-of-the-art learning based method requires specific information about the holes in the training phase. Experiments on three datasets show that our method successfully predicts information in large missing regions and achieves pixel-level photorealism, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yeh_Semantic_Image_Inpainting_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Raymond A.

Semantic Instance Segmentation for Autonomous Driving	Semantic instance segmentation remains a challenging task. In this work we propose to tackle the problem with a discriminative loss function, operating at the pixel level, that encourages a convolutional network to produce a representation of the image that can easily be clustered into instances with a simple post-processing step. Our approach of combining an off-the-shelf network with a principled loss function inspired by a metric learning objective is conceptually simple and distinct from recent efforts in instance segmentation and is well-suited for real-time applications. In contrast to previous works, our method does not rely on object proposals or recurrent mechanisms and is particularly well suited for tasks with complex occlusions. A key contribution of our work is to demonstrate that such a simple setup without bells and whistles is effective and can perform on-par with more complex methods. We achieve competitive performance on the Cityscapes segmentation benchmark.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w5/html/De_Brabandere_Semantic_Instance_Segmentation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Bert De Brabandere, Davy Neven, Luc Van Gool
Semantic Multi-View Stereo: Jointly Estimating Objects and Voxels	Dense 3D reconstruction from RGB images is a highly ill-posed problem due to occlusions, textureless or reflective surfaces, as well as other challenges. We propose object-level shape priors to address these ambiguities. Towards this goal, we formulate a probabilistic model that integrates multi-view image evidence with 3D shape information from multiple objects. Inference in this model yields a dense 3D reconstruction of the scene as well as the existence and precise 3D pose of the objects in it. Our approach is able to recover fine details not captured in the input shapes while defaulting to the input models in occluded regions where image evidence is weak. Due to its probabilistic nature, the approach is able to cope with the approximate geometry of the 3D models as well as input shapes that are not present in the scene. We evaluate the approach quantitatively on several challenging indoor and outdoor datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ulusoy_Semantic_Multi-View_Stereo_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ali Osman Ulusoy, Michael J.

Semantic Regularisation for Recurrent Image Annotation	"The ""CNN-RNN"" design pattern is increasingly widely applied in a variety of image annotation tasks including multi-label classification and captioning. Existing models use the weakly semantic CNN hidden layer or its transform as the image embedding that provides the interface between the CNN and RNN. This leaves the RNN overstretched with two jobs: predicting the visual concepts and modelling their correlations for generating structured annotation output. Importantly this makes the end-to-end training of the CNN and RNN slow and ineffective due to the difficulty of back propagating gradients through the RNN to train the CNN. We propose a simple modification to the design pattern that makes learning more effective and efficient. Specifically, we propose to use a semantically regularised embedding layer as the interface between the CNN and RNN. Regularising the interface can partially or completely decouple the learning problems, allowing each to be more effectively trained and jointly training much more efficient. Extensive experiments show that state-of-the art performance is achieved on multi-label classification as well as image captioning."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Liu_Semantic_Regularisation_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Feng Liu, Tao Xiang, Timothy M.

Semantic Scene Completion From a Single Depth Image	This paper focuses on semantic scene completion, a task for producing a complete 3D voxel representation of volumetric occupancy and semantic labels for a scene from a single-view depth map observation. Previous work has considered scene completion and semantic labeling of depth maps separately. However, we observe that these two problems are tightly intertwined. To leverage the coupled nature of these two tasks, we introduce the semantic scene completion network (SSCNet), an end-to-end 3D convolutional network that takes a single depth image as input and simultaneously outputs occupancy and semantic labels for all voxels in the camera view frustum. Our network uses a dilation-based 3D context module to efficiently expand the receptive field and enable 3D context learning. To train our network, we construct SUNCG - a manually created largescale dataset of synthetic 3D scenes with dense volumetric annotations. Our experiments demonstrate that the joint model outperforms methods addressing each task in isolation and outperforms alternative approaches on the semantic scene completion task. The dataset and code is available at http://sscnet.cs.princeton.edu.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Song_Semantic_Scene_Completion_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shuran Song, Fisher Yu, Andy Zeng, Angel X.

Semantic Segmentation via Structured Patch Prediction, Context CRF and Guidance CRF	This paper describes a fast and accurate semantic image segmentation approach that encodes not only segmentation-specified features but also high-order context compatibilities and boundary guidance constraints. We introduce a structured patch prediction technique to make a trade-off between classification discriminability and boundary sensibility for features. Both label and feature contexts are embedded to ensure recognition accuracy and compatibility, while the complexity of the high order cliques is reduced by a distance-aware sampling and pooling strategy. The proposed joint model also employs a guidance CRF to further enhance the segmentation performance. The message passing step is augmented with the guided filtering which enables an efficient and joint training of the whole system in an end-to-end fashion. Our proposed joint model outperforms the state-of-art on Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscapes, with mIoU(%) of 82.5 and 79.2 respectively. It also reaches a leading performance on ADE20K, which is the dataset of the scene parsing track in ILSVRC 2016.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Shen_Semantic_Segmentation_via_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Falong Shen, Rui Gan, Shuicheng Yan, Gang Zeng
Semantically Coherent Co-Segmentation and Reconstruction of Dynamic Scenes	In this paper we propose a framework for spatially and temporally coherent semantic co-segmentation and reconstruction of complex dynamic scenes from multiple static or moving cameras. Semantic co-segmentation exploits the coherence in semantic class labels both spatially, between views at a single time instant, and temporally, between widely spaced time instants of dynamic objects with similar shape and appearance. We demonstrate that semantic coherence results in improved segmentation and reconstruction for complex scenes. A joint formulation is proposed for semantically coherent object-based co-segmentation and reconstruction of scenes by enforcing consistent semantic labelling between views and over time. Semantic tracklets are introduced to enforce temporal coherence in semantic labelling and reconstruction between widely spaced instances of dynamic objects. Tracklets of dynamic objects enable unsupervised learning of appearance and shape priors that are exploited in joint segmentation and reconstruction. Evaluation on challenging indoor and outdoor sequences with hand-held moving cameras shows improved accuracy in segmentation, temporally coherent semantic labelling and 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Mustafa_Semantically_Coherent_Co-Segmentation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Armin Mustafa, Adrian Hilton
Semantically Consistent Regularization for Zero-Shot Recognition	The role of semantics in zero-shot learning is considered. The effectiveness of previous approaches is analyzed according to the form of supervision provided. While some learn semantics independently, others only supervise the semantic subspace explained by training classes. Thus, the former is able to constrain the whole space but lacks the ability to model semantic correlations. The latter addresses this issue but leaves part of the semantic space unsupervised. This complementarity is exploited in a new convolutional neural network (CNN) framework, which proposes the use of semantics as constraints for recognition.Although a CNN trained for classification has no transfer ability, this can be encouraged by learning an hidden semantic layer together with a semantic code for classification. Two forms of semantic constraints are then introduced. The first is a loss-based regularizer that introduces a generalization constraint on each semantic predictor. The second is a codeword regularizer that favors semantic-to-class mappings consistent with prior semantic knowledge while allowing these to be learned from data. Significant improvements over the state-of-the-art are achieved on several datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Morgado_Semantically_Consistent_Regularization_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Pedro Morgado, Nuno Vasconcelos
Semi-Calibrated Near Field Photometric Stereo	3D reconstruction from shading information through Photometric Stereo is considered a very challenging problem in Computer Vision. Although this technique can potentially provide highly detailed shape recovery, its accuracy is critically dependent on a numerous set of factors among them the reliability of the light sources in emitting a constant amount of light. In this work, we propose a novel variational approach to solve the so called semi-calibrated near field Photometric Stereo problem, where the positions but not the brightness of the light sources are known. Additionally, we take into account realistic modeling features such as perspective viewing geometry and heterogeneous scene composition, containing both diffuse and specular objects. Furthermore, we also relax the point light source assumption that usually constraints the near field formulation by explicitly calculating the light attenuation maps. Synthetic experiments are performed for quantitative evaluation for a wide range of cases whilst real experiments provide comparisons, qualitatively outperforming the state of the art.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Logothetis_Semi-Calibrated_Near_Field_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Fotios Logothetis, Roberto Mecca, Roberto Cipolla
Semi-Supervised Deep Learning for Monocular Depth Map Prediction	Supervised deep learning often suffers from the lack of sufficient training data. Specifically in the context of monocular depth map prediction, it is barely possible to determine dense ground truth depth images in realistic dynamic outdoor environments. When using LiDAR sensors, for instance, noise is present in the distance measurements, the calibration between sensors cannot be perfect, and the measurements are typically much sparser than the camera images. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to depth map prediction from monocular images that learns in a semi-supervised way. While we use sparse ground-truth depth for supervised learning, we also enforce our deep network to produce photoconsistent dense depth maps in a stereo setup using a direct image alignment loss. In experiments we demonstrate superior performance in depth map prediction from single images compared to the state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kuznietsov_Semi-Supervised_Deep_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yevhen Kuznietsov, Jorg Stuckler, Bastian Leibe
Sequential Person Recognition in Photo Albums With a Recurrent Network	Recognizing the identities of people in everyday photos is still a very challenging problem for machine vision, due to issues such as non-frontal faces, changes in clothing, location, lighting. Recent studies have shown that rich relational information between people in the same photo can help in recognizing their identities. In this work, we propose to model the relational information between people as a sequence prediction task. At the core of our work is a novel recurrent network architecture, in which relational information between instances' labels and appearance are modeled jointly. In addition to relational cues, scene context is incorporated in our sequence prediction model with no additional cost. In this sense, our approach is a unified framework for modeling both contextual cues and visual appearance of person instances. Our model is trained end-to-end with a sequence of annotated instances in a photo as inputs, and a sequence of corresponding labels as targets. We demonstrate that this simple but elegant formulation achieves state-of-the-art performance on the newly released People In Photo Albums (PIPA) dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Li_Sequential_Person_Recognition_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yao Li, Guosheng Lin, Bohan Zhuang, Lingqiao Liu, Chunhua Shen, Anton van den Hengel
Shading Annotations in the Wild	Understanding shading effects in images is critical for a variety of vision and graphics problems, including intrinsic image decomposition, shadow removal, image relighting, and inverse rendering. As is the case with other vision tasks, machine learning is a promising approach to understanding shading - but there is little ground truth shading data available for real-world images. We introduce Shading Annotations in the Wild (SAW), a new large-scale, public dataset of shading annotations in indoor scenes, comprised of multiple forms of shading judgments obtained via crowdsourcing, along with shading annotations automatically generated from RGB-D imagery. We use this data to train a convolutional neural network to predict per-pixel shading information in an image. We demonstrate the value of our data and network in an application to intrinsic images, where we can reduce decomposition artifacts produced by existing algorithms. Our database is available at http://opensurfaces.cs.cornell.edu/saw/.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kovacs_Shading_Annotations_in_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Balazs Kovacs, Sean Bell, Noah Snavely, Kavita Bala
Shape Completion Using 3D-Encoder-Predictor CNNs and Shape Synthesis	We introduce a data-driven approach to complete partial 3D shapes through a combination of volumetric deep neural networks and 3D shape synthesis. From a partially-scanned input shape, our method first infers a low-resolution -- but complete -- output. To this end, we introduce a 3D-Encoder-Predictor Network (3D-EPN) which is composed of 3D convolutional layers. The network is trained to predict and fill in missing data, and operates on an implicit surface representation that encodes both known and unknown space. This allows us to predict global structure in unknown areas at high accuracy. We then correlate these intermediary results with 3D geometry from a shape database at test time. In a final pass, we propose a patch-based 3D shape synthesis method that imposes the 3D geometry from these retrieved shapes as constraints on the coarsely-completed mesh. This synthesis process enables us to reconstruct fine-scale detail and generate high-resolution output while respecting the global mesh structure obtained by the 3D-EPN. Although our 3D-EPN outperforms state-of-the-art completion method, the main contribution in our work lies in the combination of a data-driven shape predictor and analytic 3D shape synthesis. In our results, we show extensive evaluations on a newly-introduced shape completion benchmark for both real-world and synthetic data.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Dai_Shape_Completion_Using_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Angela Dai, Charles Ruizhongtai Qi, Matthias Niessner
ShapeOdds: Variational Bayesian Learning of Generative Shape Models	Shape models provide a compact parameterization of a class of shapes, and have been shown to be important to a variety of vision problems, including object detection, tracking, and image segmentation. Learning generative shape models from grid-structured representations, aka silhouettes, is usually hindered by (1) data likelihoods with intractable marginals and posteriors, (2) high-dimensional shape spaces with limited training samples (and the associated risk of overfitting), and (3) estimation of hyperparameters relating to model complexity that often entails computationally expensive grid searches. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian treatment that relies on direct probabilistic formulation for learning generative shape models in the silhouettes space. We propose a variational approach for learning a latent variable model in which we make use of, and extend, recent works on variational bounds of logistic-Gaussian integrals to circumvent intractable marginals and posteriors. Spatial coherency and sparsity priors are also incorporated to lend stability to the optimization problem by regularizing the solution space while avoiding overfitting in this high-dimensional, low-sample-size scenario. We deploy a type-II maximum likelihood estimate of the model hyperparameters to avoid grid searches. We demonstrate that the proposed model generates realistic samples, generalizes to unseen examples, and is able to handle missing regions and/or background clutter, while comparing favorably with recent, neural-network-based approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Elhabian_ShapeOdds_Variational_Bayesian_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shireen Elhabian, Ross Whitaker
Signal Classification in Quotient Spaces via Globally Optimal Variational Calculus	A ubiquitous problem in pattern recognition is that of matching an observed time-evolving pattern (or signal) to a gold standard in order to recognize or characterize the meaning of a dynamic phenomenon. Examples include matching sequences of images in two videos, matching audio signals in speech recognition, or matching framed trajectories in robot action recognition. This paper shows that all of these problems can be aided by reparameterizing the temporal dependence of each signal individually to a universal standard timescale that allows pointwise comparison at each instance of time. Given two sequences, each with N timesteps, the complexity of the algorithm has a cost of O(N), which is an improvement on the most common method for matching two signals, i.e., dynamic time warping. The core of the approach presented here is that the universal standard timescale is found by solving a variational calculus problem related to differential geometry.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w7/html/Chirikjian_Signal_Classification_in_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Gregory S.

Simple Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on Deep Neural Networks	Deep neural networks are powerful and popular learning models that achieve state-of-the-art pattern recognition performance on many computer vision, speech, and language processing tasks. However, these networks have also been shown susceptible to crafted adversarial perturbations which force misclassification of the inputs. Adversarial examples enable adversaries to subvert the expected system behavior leading to undesired consequences and could pose a security risk when these systems are deployed in the real world. In this work, we focus on deep convolutional neural networks and demonstrate that adversaries can easily craft adversarial examples even without any internal knowledge of the target network. Our attacks treat the network as an oracle (black-box) and only assume that the output of the network can be observed on the probed inputs. Our attacks utilize a novel local-search based technique to construct numerical approximation to the network gradient, which is then carefully used to construct a small set of pixels in an image to perturb. We demonstrate how this underlying idea can be adapted to achieve several strong notions of misclassification. The simplicity and effectiveness of our proposed schemes mean that they could serve as a litmus test for designing robust networks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w16/html/Kasiviswanathan_Simple_Black-Box_Adversarial_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Nina Narodytska; Shiva Kasiviswanathan
Simple Does It: Weakly Supervised Instance and Semantic Segmentation	Semantic labelling and instance segmentation are two tasks that require particularly costly annotations. Starting from weak supervision in the form of bounding box detection annotations, we propose a new approach that does not require modification of the segmentation training procedure. We show that when carefully designing the input labels from given bounding boxes, even a single round of training is enough to improve over previously reported weakly supervised results. Overall, our weak supervision approach reaches 95% of the quality of the fully supervised model, both for semantic labelling and instance segmentation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Khoreva_Simple_Does_It_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Anna Khoreva, Rodrigo Benenson, Jan Hosang, Matthias Hein, Bernt Schiele
Simultaneous Facial Landmark Detection, Pose and Deformation Estimation Under Facial Occlusion	Facial landmark detection, head pose estimation, and facial deformation analysis are typical facial behavior analysis tasks in computer vision. The existing methods usually perform each task independently and sequentially, ignoring their interactions. To tackle this problem, we propose a unified framework for simultaneous facial landmark detection, head pose estimation, and facial deformation analysis, and the proposed model is robust to facial occlusion. Following a cascade procedure augmented with model-based head pose estimation, we iteratively update the facial landmark locations, facial occlusion, head pose and facial deformation until convergence. The experimental results on benchmark databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for simultaneous facial landmark detection, head pose and facial deformation estimation, even if the images are under facial occlusion.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wu_Simultaneous_Facial_Landmark_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yue Wu, Chao Gou, Qiang Ji
Simultaneous Feature Aggregating and Hashing for Large-Scale Image Search	In most state-of-the-art hashing-based visual search systems, local image descriptors of an image are first aggregated as a single feature vector. This feature vector is then subjected to a hashing function that produces a binary hash code. In previous work, the aggregating and the hashing processes are designed independently. In this paper, we propose a novel framework where feature aggregating and hashing are designed simultaneously and optimized jointly. Specifically, our joint optimization produces aggregated representations that can be better reconstructed by some binary codes. This leads to more discriminative binary hash codes and improved retrieval accuracy. In addition, we also propose a fast version of the recently-proposed Binary Autoencoder to be used in our proposed framework. We perform extensive retrieval experiments on several benchmark datasets with both SIFT and convolutional features. Our results suggest that the proposed framework achieves significant improvements over the state of the art.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Do_Simultaneous_Feature_Aggregating_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Thanh-Toan Do, Dang-Khoa Le Tan, Trung T.

Simultaneous Geometric and Radiometric Calibration of a Projector-Camera Pair	We present a novel method that allows for simultaneous geometric and radiometric calibration of a projector-camera pair. It is simple and does not require specialized hardware. We prewarp and align a specially designed projection pattern onto a printed pattern of different colorimetric properties. After capturing the patterns in several orientations, we perform geometric calibration by estimating the corner locations of the two patterns in different color channels. We perform radiometric calibration of the projector by using the information contained inside the projected squares. We show that our method performs on par with current approaches that all require separate geometric and radiometric calibration, while being more efficient and user friendly.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Shahpaski_Simultaneous_Geometric_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Marjan Shahpaski, Luis Ricardo Sapaico, Gaspard Chevassus, Sabine Susstrunk
Simultaneous Stereo Video Deblurring and Scene Flow Estimation	Videos for outdoor scene often show unpleasant blur effects due to the large relative motion between the camera and the dynamic objects and large depth variations. Existing works typically focus monocular video deblurring. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to deblurring from stereo videos. In particular, we exploit the piece-wise planar assumption about the scene and leverage the scene flow information to deblur the image. Unlike the existing approach [31] which used a pre-computed scene flow, we propose a single framework to jointly estimate the scene flow and deblur the image, where the motion cues from scene flow estimation and blur information could reinforce each other, and produce superior results than the conventional scene flow estimation or stereo deblurring methods. We evaluate our method extensively on two available datasets and achieve significant improvement in flow estimation and removing the blur effect over the state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Pan_Simultaneous_Stereo_Video_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Liyuan Pan, Yuchao Dai, Miaomiao Liu, Fatih Porikli
Simultaneous Super-Resolution and Cross-Modality Synthesis of 3D Medical Images Using Weakly-Supervised Joint Convolutional Sparse Coding	Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers high-resolution in vivo imaging and rich functional and anatomical multimodality tissue contrast. In practice, however, there are challenges associated with considerations of scanning costs, patient comfort, and scanning time that constrain how much data can be acquired in clinical or research studies. In this paper, we explore the possibility of generating high-resolution and multimodal images from low-resolution single-modality imagery. We propose the weakly-supervised joint convolutional sparse coding to simultaneously solve the problems of super-resolution (SR) and cross-modality image synthesis. The learning process requires only a few registered multimodal image pairs as the training set. Additionally, the quality of the joint dictionary learning can be improved using a larger set of unpaired images. To combine unpaired data from different image resolutions/modalities, a hetero-domain image alignment term is proposed. Local image neighborhoods are naturally preserved by operating on the whole image domain (as opposed to image patches) and using joint convolutional sparse coding. The paired images are enhanced in the joint learning process with unpaired data and an additional maximum mean discrepancy term, which minimizes the dissimilarity between their feature distributions. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on both SR reconstruction and simultaneous SR and cross-modality synthesis.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Huang_Simultaneous_Super-Resolution_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yawen Huang, Ling Shao, Alejandro F.

Simultaneous Visual Data Completion and Denoising Based on Tensor Rank and Total Variation Minimization and Its Primal-Dual Splitting Algorithm	"Tensor completion has attracted attention because of its promising ability and generality. However, there are few studies on noisy scenarios which directly solve an optimization problem consisting of a ""noise inequality constraint"". In this paper, we propose a new tensor completion and denoising model including tensor total variation and tensor nuclear norm minimization with a range of values and noise inequalities. Furthermore, we developed its solution algorithm based on a primal-dual splitting method, which is computationally efficient as compared to tensor decomposition based non-convex optimization. Lastly, extensive experiments demonstrated the advantages of the proposed method for visual data retrieval such as for color images, movies, and 3D-volumetric data."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yokota_Simultaneous_Visual_Data_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tatsuya Yokota, Hidekata Hontani
Single Image Reflection Suppression	Reflections are a common artifact in images taken through glass windows. Automatically removing the reflection artifacts after the picture is taken is an ill-posed problem. Attempts to solve this problem using optimization schemes therefore rely on various prior assumptions from the physical world. Instead of removing reflections from a single image, which has met with limited success so far, we propose a novel approach to suppress reflections. It is based on a Laplacian data fidelity term and an l-zero gradient sparsity term imposed on the output. With experiments on artificial and real-world images we show that our reflection suppression method performs better than the state-of-the-art reflection removal techniques.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Arvanitopoulos_Single_Image_Reflection_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Nikolaos Arvanitopoulos, Radhakrishna Achanta, Sabine Susstrunk
Singlets: Multi-Resolution Motion Singularities for Soccer Video Abstraction	The burst of video production appeals for new browsing frameworks. Chiefly in sports, TV companies have years of recorded match archives to exploit and sports fans are looking for replay, summary or collection of events. In this work, we design a new multi-resolution motion feature for video abstraction. This descriptor is based on optical flow singularities tracked along the video. We use these singlets in order to detect zooms, slow-motions and salient moments in soccer games and finally to produce an automatic summarization of a game. We produce a database for soccer video summarization composed of 4 soccer matches from HDTV games for the FIFA world cup 2014 annotated with goals, fouls, corners and salient moments to make a summary. We correctly detect 88.2% of saliant moments using this database. To highlight the generalization of our approach, we test our system on the final game of the handball world championship 2015 without any retraining, refining or adaptation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w2/html/Blanc_Singlets_Multi-Resolution_Motion_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Katy Blanc, Diane Lingrand, Frederic Precioso
Skeleton Key: Image Captioning by Skeleton-Attribute Decomposition	Recently, there has been a lot of interest in automatically generating descriptions for an image. Most existing language-model based approaches for this task learn to generate an image description word by word in its original word order. However, for humans, it is more natural to locate the objects and their relationships first, and then elaborate on each object, describing notable attributes. We present a coarse-to-fine method that decomposes the original image description into a skeleton sentence and its attributes, and generates the skeleton sentence and attribute phrases separately. By this decomposition, our method can generate more accurate and novel descriptions than the previous state-of-the-art. Experimental results on the MS-COCO and a larger scale Stock3M datasets show that our algorithm yields consistent improvements across different evaluation metrics, especially on the SPICE metric, which has much higher correlation with human ratings than the conventional metrics. Furthermore, our algorithm can generate descriptions with varied length, benefiting from the separate control of the skeleton and attributes. This enables image description generation that better accommodates user preferences.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_Skeleton_Key_Image_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yufei Wang, Zhe Lin, Xiaohui Shen, Scott Cohen, Garrison W.

Slot Cars: 3D Modelling for Improved Visual Traffic Analytics	A major challenge in visual highway traffic analytics is to disaggregate individual vehicles from clusters formed in dense traffic conditions. Here we introduce a data driven 3D generative reasoning method to tackle this segmentation problem. The method is comprised of offline (learning) and online (inference) stages. In the offline stage, we fit a mixture model for the prior distribution of vehicle dimensions to labelled data. Given camera intrinsic parameters and height, we use a parallelism method to estimate highway lane structure and camera tilt to project 3D models to the image. In the online stage, foreground vehicle cluster segments are extracted using motion and background subtraction. For each segment, we use a data-driven MCMC method to estimate the vehicles configuration and dimensions that provide the most likely account of the observed foreground pixels. We evaluate the method on two highway datasets and demonstrate a substantial improvement on the state of the art.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w9/html/Corral-Soto_Slot_Cars_3D_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Eduardo R.

Slow Flow: Exploiting High-Speed Cameras for Accurate and Diverse Optical Flow Reference Data	Existing optical flow datasets are limited in size and variability due to the difficulty of capturing dense ground truth. In this paper, we tackle this problem by tracking pixels through densely sampled space-time volumes recorded with a high-speed video camera. Our model exploits the linearity of small motions and reasons about occlusions from multiple frames. Using our technique, we are able to establish accurate reference flow fields outside the laboratory in natural environments. Besides, we show how our predictions can be used to augment the input images with realistic motion blur. We demonstrate the quality of the produced flow fields on synthetic and real-world datasets. Finally, we collect a novel challenging optical flow dataset by applying our technique on data from a high-speed camera and analyze the performance of the state-of-the-art in optical flow under various levels of motion blur.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Janai_Slow_Flow_Exploiting_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Joel Janai, Fatma Guney, Jonas Wulff, Michael J.

Snapshot Hyperspectral Light Field Imaging	This paper presents the first snapshot hyperspectral light field imager in practice. Specifically, we design a novel hybrid camera system to obtain two complementary measurements that sample the angular and spectral dimensions respectively. To recover the full 5D hyperspectral light field from the severely undersampled measurements, we then propose an efficient computational reconstruction algorithm by exploiting the large correlations across the angular and spectral dimensions through self-learned dictionaries. Simulation on an elaborate hyperspectral light field dataset validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Hardware experimental results demonstrate that, for the first time to our knowledge, a 5D hyperspectral light field containing 9x9 angular views and 27 spectral bands can be acquired in a single shot.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xiong_Snapshot_Hyperspectral_Light_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhiwei Xiong, Lizhi Wang, Huiqun Li, Dong Liu, Feng Wu
Social Scene Understanding: End-To-End Multi-Person Action Localization and Collective Activity Recognition	We present a unified framework for understanding human social behaviors in raw image sequences.

Soft-Margin Mixture of Regressions	Nonlinear regression is a common statistical tool to solve many computer vision problems (e.g., age estimation, pose estimation). Existing approaches to nonlinear regression fall into two main categories: (1) The universal approach provides an implicit or explicit homogeneous feature mapping (e.g., kernel ridge regression, Gaussian process regression, neural networks). These approaches may fail when data is heterogeneous or discontinuous. (2) Divide-and-conquer approaches partition a heterogeneous input feature space and learn multiple local regressors. However, existing divide-and-conquer approaches fail to deal with discontinuities between partitions (e.g., Gaussian mixture of regressions) and they cannot guarantee that the partitioned input space will be homogeneously modeled by local regressors (e.g., ordinal regression). To address these issues, this paper proposes Soft-Margin Mixture of Regressions (SMMR), a method that directly learns homogeneous partitions of the input space and is able to deal with discontinuities. SMMR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three popular computer vision tasks: age estimation, crowd counting and viewpoint estimation from images.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Huang_Soft-Margin_Mixture_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Dong Huang, Longfei Han, Fernando De la Torre
Sparse, Quantized, Full Frame CNN for Low Power Embedded Devices	This paper presents methods to reduce the complexity of convolutional neural networks (CNN).

(2) Fine tune the sparse network to obtain the lost accuracy back (3) Quantize the network to be able to implement it using 8-bit fixed point multiplications efficiently. (4) We then show how an inference engine can be designed to take advantage of the sparsity. These techniques were applied to full frame semantic segmentation and the degradation due to the sparsity and quantization is found to be negligible.

Spatial-Semantic Image Search by Visual Feature Synthesis	The performance of image retrieval has been improved tremendously in recent years through the use of deep feature representations. Most existing methods, however, aim to retrieve images that are visually similar or semantically relevant to the query, irrespective of spatial configuration. In this paper, we develop a spatial-semantic image search technology that enables users to search for images with both semantic and spatial constraints by manipulating concept text-boxes on a 2D query canvas. We train a convolutional neural network to synthesize appropriate visual features that captures the spatial-semantic constraints from the user canvas query. We directly optimize the retrieval performance of the visual features when training our deep neural network. These visual features then are used to retrieve images that are both spatially and semantically relevant to the user query. The experiments on large-scale datasets such as MS-COCO and Visual Genome show that our method outperforms other baseline and state-of-the-art methods in spatial-semantic image search.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Mai_Spatial-Semantic_Image_Search_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Long Mai, Hailin Jin, Zhe Lin, Chen Fang, Jonathan Brandt, Feng Liu

Spatially-Varying Blur Detection Based on Multiscale Fused and Sorted Transform Coefficients of Gradient Magnitudes	The detection of spatially-varying blur without having any information about the blur type is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel effective approach to address this blur detection problem from a single image without requiring any knowledge about the blur type, level, or camera settings. Our approach computes blur detection maps based on a novel High-frequency multiscale Fusion and Sort Transform (HiFST) of gradient magnitudes. The evaluations of the proposed approach on a diverse set of blurry images with different blur types, levels, and contents demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Golestaneh_Spatially-Varying_Blur_Detection_CVPR_2017_paper.html	S.

Spatio-Temporal Alignment of Non-Overlapping Sequences From Independently Panning Cameras	This paper addresses the problem of spatio-temporal alignment of multiple video sequences. We identify and tackle a novel scenario of this problem referred to as Nonoverlapping Sequences (NOS). NOS are captured by multiple freely panning handheld cameras whose field of views (FOV) might have no direct spatial overlap. With the popularity of mobile sensors, NOS rise when multiple cooperative users capture a public event to create a panoramic video, or when consolidating multiple footages of an incident into a single video. To tackle this novel scenario, we first spatially align the sequences by reconstructing the background of each sequence and registering these backgrounds, even if the backgrounds are not overlapping. Given the spatial alignment, we temporally synchronize the sequences, such that the trajectories of moving objects (e.g., cars or pedestrians) are consistent across sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in this novel and challenging scenario, quantitatively and qualitatively.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Safdarnejad_Spatio-Temporal_Alignment_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Seyed Morteza Safdarnejad, Xiaoming Liu
Spatio-Temporal Naive-Bayes Nearest-Neighbor (ST-NBNN) for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition	Motivated by previous success of using non-parametric methods to recognize objects, e.g., NBNN, we extend it to recognize actions using skeletons. Each 3D action is presented by a sequence of 3D poses. Similar to NBNN, our proposed Spatio-Temporal-NBNN applies stage-to-class distance to classify actions. However, ST-NBNN takes the spatio-temporal structure of 3D actions into consideration and relaxes the Naive Bayes assumption of NBNN. Specifically, ST-NBNN adopts bilinear classifiers to identify both key temporal stages as well as spatial joints for action classification. Although only using a linear classifier, experiments on three benchmark datasets show that by combining the strength of both non-parametric and parametric models, ST-NBNN can achieve competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art results using sophisticated models such as deep learning. Moreover, by identifying key skeleton joints and temporal stages for each action class, our ST-NBNN can capture the essential spatio-temporal patterns that play key roles of recognizing actions, which is not always achievable by using end-to-end models.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Weng_Spatio-Temporal_Naive-Bayes_Nearest-Neighbor_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Junwu Weng, Chaoqun Weng, Junsong Yuan
Spatio-Temporal Self-Organizing Map Deep Network for Dynamic Object Detection From Videos	In dynamic object detection, it is challenging to construct an effective model to sufficiently characterize the spatial-temporal properties of the background. This paper proposes a new Spatio-Temporal Self-Organizing Map (STSOM) deep network to detect dynamic objects in complex scenarios. The proposed approach has several contributions: First, a novel STSOM shared by all pixels in a video frame is presented to efficiently model complex background. We exploit the fact that the motions of complex background have the global variation in the space and the local variation in the time, to train STSOM using the whole frames and the sequence of a pixel over time to tackle the variance of complex background. Second, a Bayesian parameter estimation based method is presented to learn thresholds automatically for all pixels to filter out the background. Last, in order to model the complex background more accurately, we extend the single-layer STSOM to the deep network. Then the background is filtered out layer by layer. Experimental results on CDnet 2014 dataset demonstrate that the proposed STSOM deep network outperforms numerous recently proposed methods in the overall performance and in most categories of scenarios.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Du_Spatio-Temporal_Self-Organizing_Map_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yang Du, Chunfeng Yuan, Bing Li, Weiming Hu, Stephen Maybank
Spatio-Temporal Vector of Locally Max Pooled Features for Action Recognition in Videos	We introduce Spatio-Temporal Vector of Locally Max Pooled Features (ST-VLMPF), a super vector-based encoding method specifically designed for local deep features encoding. The proposed method addresses an important problem of video understanding: how to build a video representation that incorporates the CNN features over the entire video. Feature assignment is carried out at two levels, by using the similarity and spatio-temporal information. For each assignment we build a specific encoding, focused on the nature of deep features, with the goal to capture the highest feature responses from the highest neuron activation of the network. Our ST-VLMPF clearly provides a more reliable video representation than some of the most widely used and powerful encoding approaches (Improved Fisher Vectors and Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors), while maintaining a low computational complexity.

Spatiotemporal Multiplier Networks for Video Action Recognition	This paper presents a general ConvNet architecture for video action recognition based on multiplicative interactions of spacetime features. Our model combines the appearance and motion pathways of a two-stream architecture by motion gating and is trained end-to-end. We theoretically motivate multiplicative gating functions for residual networks and empirically study their effect on classification accuracy. To capture long-term dependencies we inject identity mapping kernels for learning temporal relationships. Our architecture is fully convolutional in spacetime and able to evaluate a video in a single forward pass. Empirical investigation reveals that our model produces state-of-the-art results on two standard action recognition datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Feichtenhofer_Spatiotemporal_Multiplier_Networks_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Christoph Feichtenhofer, Axel Pinz, Richard P.

Spatiotemporal Pyramid Network for Video Action Recognition	Two-stream convolutional networks have shown strong performance in video action recognition tasks. The key idea is to learn spatiotemporal features by fusing convolutional networks spatially and temporally. However, it remains unclear how to model the correlations between the spatial and temporal structures at multiple abstraction levels. First, the spatial stream tends to fail if two videos share similar backgrounds. Second, the temporal stream may be fooled if two actions resemble in short snippets, though appear to be distinct in the long term. We propose a novel spatiotemporal pyramid network to fuse the spatial and temporal features in a pyramid structure such that they can reinforce each other. From the architecture perspective, our network constitutes hierarchical fusion strategies which can be trained as a whole using a unified spatiotemporal loss. A series of ablation experiments support the importance of each fusion strategy. From the technical perspective, we introduce the spatiotemporal compact bilinear operator into video analysis tasks. This operator enables efficient training of bilinear fusion operations which can capture full interactions between the spatial and temporal features. Our final network achieves state-of-the-art results on standard video datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_Spatiotemporal_Pyramid_Network_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yunbo Wang, Mingsheng Long, Jianmin Wang, Philip S.

Specular Highlight Removal in Facial Images	We present a method for removing specular highlight reflections in facial images that may contain varying illumination colors. This is accurately achieved through the use of physical and statistical properties of human skin and faces. We employ a melanin and hemoglobin based model to represent the diffuse color variations in facial skin, and utilize this model to constrain the highlight removal solution in a manner that is effective even for partially saturated pixels. The removal of highlights is further facilitated through estimation of directionally variant illumination colors over the face, which is done while taking advantage of a statistically-based approximation of facial geometry. An important practical feature of the proposed method is that the skin color model is utilized in a way that does not require color calibration of the camera. Moreover, this approach does not require assumptions commonly needed in previous highlight removal techniques, such as uniform illumination color or piecewise-constant surface colors. We validate this technique through comparisons to existing methods for removing specular highlights.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Li_Specular_Highlight_Removal_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chen Li, Stephen Lin, Kun Zhou, Katsushi Ikeuchi
Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation With Implicit Emotional Awareness: A Deep Learning Approach	We introduce a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) approach for real-time facial animation, which automatically estimates head rotation and facial action unit activations of a speaker from just her speech. Specifically, the time-varying contextual non-linear mapping between audio stream and visual facial movements is realized by training a LSTM neural network on a large audio-visual data corpus. In this work, we extract a set of acoustic features from input audio, including Mel-scaled spectrogram, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients and chromagram that can effectively represent both contextual progression and emotional intensity of the speech. Output facial movements are characterized by 3D rotation and blending expression weights of a blendshape model, which can be used directly for animation. Thus, even though our model does not explicitly predict the affective states of the target speaker, her emotional manifestation is recreated via expression weights of the face model. Experiments on an evaluation dataset of different speakers across a wide range of affective states demonstrate promising results of our approach in real-time speech-driven facial animation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w41/html/Pavlovic_Speech-Driven_3D_Facial_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hai X.

Speed/Accuracy Trade-Offs for Modern Convolutional Object Detectors	"The goal of this paper is to serve as a guide for selecting a detection architecture that achieves the right speed/memory/accuracy balance for a given application and platform. To this end, we investigate various ways to trade accuracy for speed and memory usage in modern convolutional object detection systems. A number of successful systems have been proposed in recent years, but apples-to-apples comparisons are difficult due to different base feature extractors (e.g., VGG, Residual Networks), different default image resolutions, as well as different hardware and software platforms. We present a unified implementation of the Faster R-CNN (Ren et al., 2015), R-FCN (Dai et al., 2016) and SSD (Liu et al., 2016) systems, which we view as ""meta-architectures"" and trace out the speed/accuracy trade-off curve created by using alternative feature extractors and varying other critical parameters such as image size within each of these meta-architectures. On one extreme end of this spectrum where speed and memory are critical, we present a detector that achieves real time speeds and can be deployed on a mobile device. On the opposite end in which accuracy is critical, we present a detector that achieves state-of-the-art performance measured on the COCO detection task."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Huang_SpeedAccuracy_Trade-Offs_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jonathan Huang, Vivek Rathod, Chen Sun, Menglong Zhu, Anoop Korattikara, Alireza Fathi, Ian Fischer, Zbigniew Wojna, Yang Song, Sergio Guadarrama, Kevin Murphy
SphereFace: Deep Hypersphere Embedding for Face Recognition	This paper addresses deep face recognition (FR) problem under open-set protocol, where ideal face features are expected to have smaller maximal intra-class distance than minimal inter-class distance under a suitably chosen metric space. However, few existing algorithms can effectively achieve this criterion. To this end, we propose the angular softmax (A-Softmax) loss that enables convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn angularly discriminative features. Geometrically, A-Softmax loss can be viewed as imposing discriminative constraints on a hypersphere manifold, which intrinsically matches the prior that faces also lie on a manifold. Moreover, the size of angular margin can be quantitatively adjusted by a parameter m. We further derive specific m to approximate the ideal feature criterion. Extensive analysis and experiments on Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW), Youtube Faces (YTF) and MegaFace Challenge 1 show the superiority of A-Softmax loss in FR tasks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Liu_SphereFace_Deep_Hypersphere_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Weiyang Liu, Yandong Wen, Zhiding Yu, Ming Li, Bhiksha Raj, Le Song
Spindle Net: Person Re-Identification With Human Body Region Guided Feature Decomposition and Fusion	Person re-identification (ReID) is an important task in video surveillance and has various applications. It is non-trivial due to complex background clutters, varying illumination conditions, and uncontrollable camera settings. Moreover, the person body misalignment caused by detectors or pose variations is sometimes too severe for feature matching across images. In this study, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), called Spindle Net, based on human body region guided multi-stage feature decomposition and tree-structured competitive feature fusion. It is the first time human body structure information is considered in a CNN framework to facilitate feature learning. The proposed Spindle Net brings unique advantages: 1) it separately captures semantic features from different body regions thus the macro- and micro-body features can be well aligned across images, 2) the learned region features from different semantic regions are merged with a competitive scheme and discriminative features can be well preserved. State of the art performance can be achieved on multiple datasets by large margins. We further demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed Spindle Net on our proposed dataset SenseReID without fine-tuning.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhao_Spindle_Net_Person_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Haiyu Zhao, Maoqing Tian, Shuyang Sun, Jing Shao, Junjie Yan, Shuai Yi, Xiaogang Wang, Xiaoou Tang
Split-Brain Autoencoders: Unsupervised Learning by Cross-Channel Prediction	We propose split-brain autoencoders, a straightforward modification of the traditional autoencoder architecture, for unsupervised representation learning. The method adds a split to the network, resulting in two disjoint sub-networks. Each sub-network is trained to perform a difficult task -- predicting one subset of the data channels from another. Together, the sub-networks extract features from the entire input signal. By forcing the network to solve cross-channel prediction tasks, we induce a representation within the network which transfers well to other, unseen tasks. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several large-scale transfer learning benchmarks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Split-Brain_Autoencoders_Unsupervised_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Richard Zhang, Phillip Isola, Alexei A.

Sports Field Localization via Deep Structured Models	In this work, we propose a novel way of efficiently localizing a sports field from a single broadcast image of the game. Related work in this area relies on manually annotating a few key frames and extending the localization to similar images, or installing fixed specialized cameras in the stadium from which the layout of the field can be obtained. In contrast, we formulate this problem as a branch and bound inference in a Markov random field where an energy function is defined in terms of semantic cues such as the field surface, lines and circles obtained from a deep semantic segmentation network. Moreover, our approach is fully automatic and depends only on a single image from the broadcast video of the game. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to soccer and hockey.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Homayounfar_Sports_Field_Localization_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Namdar Homayounfar, Sanja Fidler, Raquel Urtasun
Spotting Audio-Visual Inconsistencies (SAVI) in Manipulated Video	This paper is part of a larger effort to detect manipulations of video by searching for and combining the evidence of multiple types of inconsistencies between the audio and visual channels. Here, we focus on inconsistencies between the type of scenes detected in the audio and visual modalities (e.g., audio indoor, small room versus visual outdoor, urban), and inconsistencies in speaker identity tracking over a video given audio speaker features and visual face features (e.g., a voice change, but no talking face change). The scene inconsistency task was complicated by mismatches in the categories used in current visual scene and audio scene collections. To deal with this, we employed a novel semantic mapping method. The speaker identity inconsistency process was challenged by the complexity of comparing face tracks and audio speech clusters, requiring a novel method of fusing these two sources. Our progress on both tasks was demonstrated on two collections of tampered videos.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w28/html/Mensink_Spotting_Audio-Visual_Inconsistencies_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Robert Bolles; J.

SqueezeDet: Unified, Small, Low Power Fully Convolutional Neural Networks for Real-Time Object Detection for Autonomous Driving	Object detection is a crucial task for autonomous driving. In addition to requiring high accuracy to ensure safety, object detection for autonomous driving also requires real-time inference speed to guarantee prompt vehicle control, as well as small model size and energy efficiency to enable embedded system deployment. In this work, we propose SqueezeDet, a fully convolutional neural network for object detection that aims to simultaneously satisfy all of the above constraints. In our network, we use convolutional layers to extract feature maps and compute bounding boxes and class probabilities. The detection pipeline of our model only contains a single forward pass of a neural network, thus it is extremely fast. Our model is fully convolutional, which leads to small model size and better energy efficiency. Finally, our experiments show that our model is very accurate, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the KITTI benchmark. The source code of SqueezeDet is open-source released.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w4/html/Wu_SqueezeDet_Unified_Small_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Bichen Wu, Forrest Iandola, Peter H.

SqueezeMap: Fast Pedestrian Detection on a Low-Power Automotive Processor Using Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks	Pedestrian detection for autonomous driving is a challenging task that requires careful trade-off between accuracy, storage, computation and energy requirements. In our work, we extend the recent SqueezeNet architecture to pedestrian detection. We show how this network can be modified to obtain detection performance on the Caltech USA pedestrian dataset that is comparable in overall log-average miss rate to other competing models while easily running at 30FPS on an automotive processor with a model size of 3.24MB and within a power envelope of 2W. The extension relies on the observation that precise knowledge of bounding box corners is not necessary to know the location of pedestrians and their approximate size. Rather, a coarse grid based localization is proposed here and acts as a kind of heatmap of pedestrian locations, relying on only one forward pass through the network. The number of new free parameters introduced is small relative to the original SqueezeNet model.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w4/html/Verbickas_SqueezeMap_Fast_Pedestrian_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Rytis Verbickas, Robert Laganiere, Daniel Laroche, Changyun Zhu, Xiaoyin Xu, Ali Ors
Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks	In this paper, we propose a novel generative model named Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (SGAN), which is trained to invert the hierarchical representations of a bottom-up discriminative network. Our model consists of a top-down stack of GANs, each learned to generate lower-level representations conditioned on higher-level representations. A representation discriminator is introduced at each feature hierarchy to encourage the representation manifold of the generator to align with that of the bottom-up discriminative network, leveraging the powerful discriminative representations to guide the generative model. In addition, we introduce a conditional loss that encourages the use of conditional information from the layer above, and a novel entropy loss that maximizes a variational lower bound on the conditional entropy of generator outputs. We first train each stack independently, and then train the whole model end-to-end. Unlike the original GAN that uses a single noise vector to represent all the variations, our SGAN decomposes variations into multiple levels and gradually resolves uncertainties in the top-down generative process. Based on visual inspection, Inception scores and visual Turing test, we demonstrate that SGAN is able to generate images of much higher quality than GANs without stacking.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Huang_Stacked_Generative_Adversarial_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xun Huang, Yixuan Li, Omid Poursaeed, John Hopcroft, Serge Belongie
Stacked Hourglass Network for Robust Facial Landmark Localisation	With the increasing number of public available training data for face alignment, the regression-based methods attracted much attention and have become the dominant methods to solve this problem. There are two main factors, the variance of the regression target and the capacity of the regression model, affecting the performance of the regression task. In this paper, we present a Stacked Hourglass Network for robust facial landmark localisation. We first adopt a supervised face transformation to remove the translation, scale and rotation variation of each face, in order to reduce the variance of the regression target. Then we employ a deep convolutional neural network named Stacked Hourglass Network to increase the capacity of the regression model. To better evaluate the proposed method, we reimplement two popular cascade shape regression models, SDM and LBF, for comparison. Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w33/html/Yang_Stacked_Hourglass_Network_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jing Yang, Qingshan Liu, Kaihua Zhang
Stereo-Based 3D Reconstruction of Dynamic Fluid Surfaces by Global Optimization	3D reconstruction of dynamic fluid surfaces is an open and challenging problem in computer vision. Unlike previous approaches that reconstruct each surface point independently and often return noisy depth maps, we propose a novel global optimization-based approach that recovers both depths and normals of all 3D points simultaneously. Using the traditional refraction stereo setup, we capture the wavy appearance of a pre-generated random pattern, and then estimate the correspondences between the captured images and the known background by tracking the pattern. Assuming that the light is refracted only once through the fluid interface, we minimize an objective function that incorporates both the cross-view normal consistency constraint and the single-view normal consistency constraints. The key idea is that the normals required for light refraction based on Snell's law from one view should agree with not only the ones from the second view, but also the ones estimated from local 3D geometry. Moreover, an effective reconstruction error metric is designed for estimating the refractive index of the fluid. We report experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrating that the proposed approach is accurate and shows superiority over the conventional stereo-based method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Qian_Stereo-Based_3D_Reconstruction_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yiming Qian, Minglun Gong, Yee-Hong Yang
Straight to Shapes: Real-Time Detection of Encoded Shapes	Current object detection approaches predict bounding boxes that provide little instance-specific information beyond location, scale and aspect ratio. In this work, we propose to regress directly to objects' shapes in addition to their bounding boxes and categories. It is crucial to find an appropriate shape representation that is compact and decodable, and in which objects can be compared for higher-order concepts such as view similarity, pose variation and occlusion. To achieve this, we use a denoising convolutional auto-encoder to learn a low-dimensional shape embedding space. We place the decoder network after a fast end-to-end deep convolutional network that is trained to regress directly to the shape vectors provided by the auto-encoder. This yields what to the best of our knowledge is the first real-time shape prediction network, running at 35 FPS on a high-end desktop. With higher-order shape reasoning well-integrated into the network pipeline, the network shows the useful practical quality of generalising to unseen categories that are similar to the ones in the training set, something that most existing approaches fail to handle.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Jetley_Straight_to_Shapes_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Saumya Jetley, Michael Sapienza, Stuart Golodetz, Philip H.

StyleBank: An Explicit Representation for Neural Image Style Transfer	We propose StyleBank, which is composed of multiple convolution filter banks and each filter bank explicitly represents one style, for neural image style transfer. To transfer an image to a specific style, the corresponding filter bank is operated on top of the intermediate feature embedding produced by a single auto-encoder. The StyleBank and the auto-encoder are jointly learnt, where the learning is conducted in such a way that the auto-encoder does not encode any style information thanks to the flexibility introduced by the explicit filter bank representation. It also enables us to conduct incremental learning to add a new image style by learning a new filter bank while holding the auto-encoder fixed. The explicit style representation along with the flexible network design enables us to fuse styles at not only the image level, but also the region level. Our method is the first style transfer network that links back to traditional texton mapping methods, and hence provides new understanding on neural style transfer. Our method is easy to train, runs in real-time, and produces results that qualitatively better or at least comparable to existing methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chen_StyleBank_An_Explicit_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Dongdong Chen, Lu Yuan, Jing Liao, Nenghai Yu, Gang Hua
StyleNet: Generating Attractive Visual Captions With Styles	We propose a novel framework named StyleNet to address the task of generating attractive captions for images and videos with different styles. To this end, we devise a novel model component, named factored LSTM, which automatically distills the style factors in the monolingual text corpus. Then at runtime, we can explicitly control the style in the caption generation process so as to produce attractive visual captions with the desired style. Our approach achieves this goal by leveraging two sets of data: 1) factual image/video-caption paired data, and 2) stylized monolingual text data (e.g., romantic and humorous sentences). We show experimentally that StyleNet outperforms existing approaches for generating visual captions with different styles, measured in both automatic and human evaluation metrics on the newly collected FlickrStyle10K image caption dataset, which contains 10K Flickr images with corresponding humorous and romantic captions.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Gan_StyleNet_Generating_Attractive_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chuang Gan, Zhe Gan, Xiaodong He, Jianfeng Gao, Li Deng
Subspace Clustering via Variance Regularized Ridge Regression	Spectral clustering based subspace clustering methods have emerged recently. When the inputs are 2-dimensional (2D) data, most existing clustering methods convert such data to vectors as preprocessing, which severely damages spatial information of the data. In this paper, we propose a novel subspace clustering method for 2D data with enhanced capability of retaining spatial information for clustering. It seeks two projection matrices and simultaneously constructs a linear representation of the projected data, such that the sought projections help construct the most expressive representation with the most variational information. We regularize our method based on covariance matrices directly obtained from 2D data, which have much smaller size and are more computationally amiable. Moreover, to exploit nonlinear structures of the data, a nonlinear version is proposed, which constructs an adaptive manifold according to updated projections. The learning processes of projections, representation, and manifold thus mutually enhance each other, leading to a powerful data representation. Efficient optimization procedures are proposed, which generate non-increasing objective value sequence with theoretical convergence guarantee. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness of proposed method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Peng_Subspace_Clustering_via_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chong Peng, Zhao Kang, Qiang Cheng
Super-Resolution of Multispectral Multiresolution Images From a Single Sensor	"Some remote sensing sensors, acquire multispectral images of different spatial resolutions in variable spectral ranges (e.g. Sentinel-2, MODIS). The aim of this research is to infer all the spectral bands, of multiresolution sensors, in the highest available resolution of the sensor. We formulate this problem as a minimisation of a convex objective function with an adaptive (edge-reserving) regulariser. The data-fitting term accounts for individual blur and downsampling per band, while the regulariser ""learns"" the discontinuities from the higher resolution bands and transfers them to other bands. We also observed that the data can be represented in a lower-dimensional subspace, reducing the dimensionality of the problem and significantly improving its conditioning. In a series of experiments with simulated data, we obtain results that outperform state-of-the-art, while showing competitive qualitative results on real Sentinel-2 data."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w18/html/Lanaras_Super-Resolution_of_Multispectral_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Charis Lanaras, Jose Bioucas-Dias, Emmanuel Baltsavias, Konrad Schindler
Superpixel-Based Tracking-By-Segmentation Using Markov Chains	We propose a simple but effective tracking-by-segmentation algorithm using Absorbing Markov Chain (AMC) on superpixel segmentation, where target state is estimated by a combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches, and target segmentation is propagated to subsequent frames in a recursive manner. Our algorithm constructs a graph for AMC using the superpixels identified in two consecutive frames, where background superpixels in the previous frame correspond to absorbing vertices while all other superpixels create transient ones. The weight of each edge depends on the similarity of scores in the end superpixels, which are learned by support vector regression. Once graph construction is completed, target segmentation is estimated using the absorption time of each superpixel. The proposed tracking algorithm achieves substantially improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art segmentation-based tracking techniques in multiple challenging datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yeo_Superpixel-Based_Tracking-By-Segmentation_Using_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Donghun Yeo, Jeany Son, Bohyung Han, Joon Hee Han

Supervising Neural Attention Models for Video Captioning by Human Gaze Data	The attention mechanisms in deep neural networks are inspired by human's attention that sequentially focuses on the most relevant parts of the information over time to generate prediction output. The attention parameters in those models are implicitly trained in an end-to-end manner, yet there have been few trials to explicitly incorporate human gaze tracking to supervise the attention models. In this paper, we investigate whether attention models can benefit from explicit human gaze labels, especially for the task of video captioning. We collect a new dataset called VAS, consisting of movie clips, and corresponding multiple descriptive sentences along with human gaze tracking data. We propose a video captioning model named Gaze Encoding Attention Network (GEAN) that can leverage gaze tracking information to provide the spatial and temporal attention for sentence generation. Through evaluation of language similarity metrics and human assessment via Amazon mechanical Turk, we demonstrate that spatial attentions guided by human gaze data indeed improve the performance of multiple captioning methods. Moreover, we show that the proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance for both gaze prediction and video captioning not only in our VAS dataset but also in standard datasets (e.g. LSMDC and Hollywood2)	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yu_Supervising_Neural_Attention_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Youngjae Yu, Jongwook Choi, Yeonhwa Kim, Kyung Yoo, Sang-Hun Lee, Gunhee Kim
SurfNet: Generating 3D Shape Surfaces Using Deep Residual Networks	3D shape models are naturally parameterized using vertices and faces, i.e, composed on polygons forming a surface. However, current 3D learning paradigms for predictive and generative tasks using convolutional neural networks focus on a voxelized representation of the object. Lifting convolution operators from the traditional 2D to 3D results in high computational overhead with little additional benefit as most of the geometry information is contained on the surface boundary. Here we study the problem of directly generating the 3D shape surface of rigid and non-rigid shapes using deep convolutional neural networks. We develop a procedure to create consistent `geometry images' representing the 3D shape surface of a category of shapes. We then use this consistent representation for category-specific shape generation from a parametric representation or an image by developing novel extensions of deep residual networks for the task of 3D surface generation. Our experiments indicate that our network learns a meaningful representation of shape surfaces allowing it to interpolate between shape orientations and poses, invent new shape surfaces, reconstruct 3D shape surfaces from previously unseen images, and rectify noisy correspondence between 3D shapes belonging to the same class.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Sinha_SurfNet_Generating_3D_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ayan Sinha, Asim Unmesh, Qixing Huang, Karthik Ramani
Surface Motion Capture Transfer With Gaussian Process Regression	We address the problem of transferring motion between captured 4D models. We particularly focus on human subjects for which the ability to automatically augment 4D datasets, by propagating movements between subjects, is of interest in a great deal of recent vision applications that builds on human visual corpus. Given 4D training sets for two subjects for which a sparse set of corresponding keyposes are known, our method is able to transfer a newly captured motion from one subject to the other. With the aim to generalize transfers to input motions possibly very diverse with respect to the training sets, the method contributes with a new transfer model based on non-linear pose interpolation. Building on Gaussian process regression, this model intends to capture and preserve individual motion properties, and thereby realism, by accounting for pose inter-dependencies during motion transfers. Our experiments show visually qualitative, and quantitative, improvements over existing pose-mapping methods and confirm the generalization capabilities of our method compared to state of the art.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Boukhayma_Surface_Motion_Capture_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Adnane Boukhayma, Jean-Sebastien Franco, Edmond Boyer
Surface Normal Reconstruction From Specular Information in Light Field Data	Specular highlights provide information about the shape of an object. Its characteristics are mostly unwanted in computer vision due to violation of the Lambertian assumption, which most algorithms require. Instead of neglecting this ubiquitous phenomenon we harvest it to extract surface normals with very high accuracy. Compared to photometric stereo our method works with multiple views and a fixed light source. We only require a low number of observation from a small part of the specular lobe to reconstruct the normal and reflection parameters. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the normal and the light transport of surfaces points. This work is a proof of concept to demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring highly accurate surface normals from specular reflection, which can be combined with conventional methods. The model is tested and evaluated on synthetic as well as real world data acquired by a cross light field setup.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w27/html/Gutsche_Surface_Normal_Reconstruction_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Marcel Gutsche, Hendrik Schilling, Maximilian Diebold, Christoph Garbe
Surveillance Video Parsing With Single Frame Supervision	Surveillance video parsing, which segments the video frames into several labels, i.e., face, pants, left-leg, has wide applications. However, annotating all frames pixel-wisely is tedious and inefficient. In this paper, we develop a Single frame Video Parsing (SVP) method which requires only one labeled frame per video in training stage. To parse one particular frame, the video segment preceding the frame is jointly considered. SVP 1: roughly parses the frames within the video segment, 2: estimates the optical flow between frames and 3: fuses the rough parsing results warped by optical flow to produce the refined parsing result. The three components of SVP, namely frame parsing, optical flow estimation and temporal fusion are integrated in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on two surveillance video datasets reveal that SVP is superior than state-of-the-arts.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Liu_Surveillance_Video_Parsing_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Si Liu, Changhu Wang, Ruihe Qian, Han Yu, Renda Bao, Yao Sun
Switching Convolutional Neural Network for Crowd Counting	We propose a novel crowd counting model that maps a given crowd scene to its density. Crowd analysis is compounded by myriad of factors like inter-occlusion between people due to extreme crowding, high similarity of appearance between people and background elements, and large variability of camera view-points. Current state-of-the art approaches tackle these factors by using multi-scale CNN architectures, recurrent networks and late fusion of features from multi-column CNN with different receptive fields. We propose switching convolutional neural network that leverages variation of crowd density within an image to improve the accuracy and localization of the predicted crowd count. Patches from a grid within a crowd scene are relayed to independent CNN regressors based on crowd count prediction quality of the CNN established during training. The independent CNN regressors are designed to have different receptive fields and a switch classifier is trained to relay the crowd scene patch to the best CNN regressor. We perform extensive experiments on all major crowd counting datasets and evidence better performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods. We provide interpretable representations of the multichotomy of space of crowd scene patches inferred from the switch.

SyncSpecCNN: Synchronized Spectral CNN for 3D Shape Segmentation	In this paper, we study the problem of semantic annotation on 3D models that are represented as shape graphs. A functional view is taken to represent localized information on graphs, so that annotations such as part segment or keypoint are nothing but 0-1 indicator vertex functions. Compared with images that are 2D grids, shape graphs are irregular and non-isomorphic data structures. To enable the prediction of vertex functions on them by convolutional neural networks, we resort to spectral CNN method that enables weight sharing by parametrizing kernels in the spectral domain spanned by graph Laplacian eigenbases. Under this setting, our network, named SyncSpecCNN, strives to overcome two key challenges: how to share coefficients and conduct multi-scale analysis in different parts of the graph for a single shape, and how to share information across related but different shapes that may be represented by very different graphs. Towards these goals, we introduce a spectral parametrization of dilated convolutional kernels and a spectral transformer network. Experimentally we tested SyncSpecCNN on various tasks, including 3D shape part segmentation and keypoint prediction. State-of-the-art performance has been achieved on all benchmark datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yi_SyncSpecCNN_Synchronized_Spectral_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Li Yi, Hao Su, Xingwen Guo, Leonidas J.

Synthesizing 3D Shapes via Modeling Multi-View Depth Maps and Silhouettes With Deep Generative Networks	We study the problem of learning generative models of 3D shapes. Voxels or 3D parts have been widely used as the underlying representations to build complex 3D shapes; however, voxel-based representations suffer from high memory requirements, and parts-based models require a large collection of cached or richly parametrized parts. We take an alternative approach: learning a generative model over multi-view depth maps or their corresponding silhouettes, and using a deterministic rendering function to produce 3D shapes from these images. A multi-view representation of shapes enables generation of 3D models with fine details, as 2D depth maps and silhouettes can be modeled at a much higher resolution than 3D voxels. Moreover, our approach naturally brings the ability to recover the underlying 3D representation from depth maps of one or a few viewpoints. Experiments show that our framework can generate 3D shapes with variations and details. We also demonstrate that our model has out-of-sample generalization power for real-world tasks with occluded objects.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Soltani_Synthesizing_3D_Shapes_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Amir Arsalan Soltani, Haibin Huang, Jiajun Wu, Tejas D.

Synthesizing Dynamic Patterns by Spatial-Temporal Generative ConvNet	"Video sequences contain rich dynamic patterns, such as dynamic texture patterns that exhibit stationarity in the temporal domain, and action patterns that are non-stationary in either spatial or temporal domain. We show that a spatial-temporal generative ConvNet can be used to model and synthesize dynamic patterns. The model defines a probability distribution on the video sequence, and the log probability is defined by a spatial-temporal ConvNet that consists of multiple layers of spatial-temporal filters to capture spatial-temporal patterns of different scales. The model can be learned from the training video sequences by an ""analysis by synthesis"" learning algorithm that iterates the following two steps. Step 1 synthesizes video sequences from the currently learned model. Step 2 then updates the model parameters based on the difference between the synthesized video sequences and the observed training sequences. We show that the learning algorithm can synthesize realistic dynamic patterns."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xie_Synthesizing_Dynamic_Patterns_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jianwen Xie, Song-Chun Zhu, Ying Nian Wu
Synthesizing Normalized Faces From Facial Identity Features	We present a method for synthesizing a frontal, neutral-expression image of a person's face, given an input face photograph. This is achieved by learning to generate facial landmarks and textures from features extracted from a facial-recognition network. Unlike previous generative approaches, our encoding feature vector is largely invariant to lighting, pose, and facial expression. Exploiting this invariance, we train our decoder network using only frontal, neutral-expression photographs. Since these photographs are well aligned, we can decompose them into a sparse set of landmark points and aligned texture maps. The decoder then predicts landmarks and textures independently and combines them using a differentiable image warping operation. The resulting images can be used for a number of applications, such as analyzing facial attributes, exposure and white balance adjustment, or creating a 3-D avatar.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Cole_Synthesizing_Normalized_Faces_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Forrester Cole, David Belanger, Dilip Krishnan, Aaron Sarna, Inbar Mosseri, William T.

TGIF-QA: Toward Spatio-Temporal Reasoning in Visual Question Answering	Vision and language understanding has emerged as a subject undergoing intense study in Artificial Intelligence. Among many tasks in this line of research, visual question answering (VQA) has been one of the most successful ones, where the goal is to learn a model that understands visual content at region-level details and finds their associations with pairs of questions and answers in the natural language form. Despite the rapid progress in the past few years, most existing work in VQA have focused primarily on images. In this paper, we focus on extending VQA to the video domain and contribute to the literature in three important ways. First, we propose three new tasks designed specifically for video VQA, which require spatio-temporal reasoning from videos to answer questions correctly. Next, we introduce a new large-scale dataset for video VQA named TGIF-QA that extends existing VQA work with our new tasks. Finally, we propose a dual-LSTM based approach with both spatial and temporal attention, and show its effectiveness over conventional VQA techniques through empirical evaluations.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Jang_TGIF-QA_Toward_Spatio-Temporal_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yunseok Jang, Yale Song, Youngjae Yu, Youngjin Kim, Gunhee Kim
Tampering Detection and Localization Through Clustering of Camera-Based CNN Features	Due to the rapid proliferation of image capturing devices and user-friendly editing software suites, image manipulation is at everyone's hand. For this reason, the forensic community has developed a series of techniques to determine image authenticity. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for image tampering detection and localization, leveraging characteristic footprints left on images by different camera models. The rationale behind our algorithm is that all pixels of pristine images should be detected as being shot with a single device. Conversely, if a picture is obtained through image composition, traces of multiple devices can be detected. The proposed algorithm exploits a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract characteristic camera model features from image patches. These features are then analyzed by means of iterative clustering techniques in order to detect whether an image has been forged, and localize the alien region.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w28/html/Tubaro_Tampering_Detection_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Luca Bondi; Silvia Lameri; David Guera; Paolo Bestagini; Edward J.

Task-Driven Dynamic Fusion: Reducing Ambiguity in Video Description	Integrating complementary features from multiple channels is expected to solve the description ambiguity problem in video captioning, whereas inappropriate fusion strategies often harm rather than help the performance. Existing static fusion methods in video captioning such as concatenation and summation cannot attend to appropriate feature channels, thus fail to adaptively support the recognition of various kinds of visual entities such as actions and objects. This paper contributes to: 1)The first in-depth study of the weakness inherent in data-driven static fusion methods for video captioning. 2) The establishment of a task-driven dynamic fusion (TDDF) method. It can adaptively choose different fusion patterns according to model status. 3) The improvement of video captioning. Extensive experiments conducted on two well-known benchmarks demonstrate that our dynamic fusion method outperforms the state-of-the-art results on MSVD with METEOR scores 0.333, and achieves superior METEOR scores 0.278 on MSR-VTT-10K. Compared to single features, the relative improvement derived from our fusion method are 10.0% and 5.7% respectively on two datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Task-Driven_Dynamic_Fusion_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xishan Zhang, Ke Gao, Yongdong Zhang, Dongming Zhang, Jintao Li, Qi Tian
Teaching Compositionality to CNNs	Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in computer vision, approaching human-level performance when trained for specific tasks via application- specific loss functions. In this paper, we propose a method for augmenting and training CNNs so that their learned features are compositional. It encourages networks to form representations that disentangle objects from their surroundings and from each other, thereby promoting better generalization. Our method is agnostic to the specific de- tails of the underlying CNN to which it is applied and can in principle be used with any CNN. As we show in our experiments, the learned representations lead to feature activations that are more localized and improve performance over non-compositional baselines in object recognition tasks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Stone_Teaching_Compositionality_to_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Austin Stone, Huayan Wang, Michael Stark, Yi Liu, D.

Teaching Computer Vision and Its Societal Effects: A Look at Privacy and Security Issues From the Students' Perspective	In this paper, we look at the societal effects of computer vision technologies from the perspective of the future minds in computer vision: senior year engineering students. Engineering education has traditionally focused on technical skills and knowledge. Nowadays, the need for educating engineers in socio-technical skills and reflective thinking, especially on the bright and dark sides of the technology they develop, is being recognized. We advocate for the integration of social awareness modules into computer vision courses so that the societal effects of technology can be studied together with the technology itself, as opposed to the often more generic 'impact of technology on society' courses. Such modules provide a venue for students to reflect on the real-world consequences of technology in concrete, practical contexts. In this paper, we present qualitative results of an observational study analyzing essays of senior year engineering students, who wrote about societal impacts of computer vision technologies of their choice. Privacy and security issues ranked as the top impact topics discussed by students among 50 topics. Similar social awareness modules would apply well to other advanced technical courses of the engineering curriculum where privacy and security are a major concern, such as big data courses. We believe that such modules are highly likely to enhance the reflective abilities of engineering graduates regarding societal impacts of novel technologies.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w16/html/Albu_Teaching_Computer_Vision_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Melissa Cote; Alexandra Branzan Albu
Template Matching With Deformable Diversity Similarity	We propose a novel measure for template matching named Deformable Diversity Similarity -- based on the diversity of feature matches between a target image window and the template. We rely on both local appearance and geometric information that jointly lead to a powerful approach for matching. Our key contribution is a similarity measure, that is robust to complex deformations, significant background clutter, and occlusions. Empirical evaluation on the most up-to-date benchmark shows that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art in its detection accuracy while improving computational complexity.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Talmi_Template_Matching_With_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Itamar Talmi, Roey Mechrez, Lihi Zelnik-Manor
Template-Based Monocular 3D Recovery of Elastic Shapes Using Lagrangian Multipliers	We present in this paper an efficient template-based method for 3D recovery of elastic shapes from a fixed monocular camera. By exploiting the object's elasticity, in contrast to isometric methods that use inextensibility constraints, a large range of deformations can be handled. Our method is expressed as a saddle point problem using Lagrangian multipliers resulting in a linear system which unifies both mechanical and optical constraints and integrates Dirichlet boundary conditions, whether they are fixed or free. We experimentally show that no prior knowledge on material properties is needed, which exhibit the generic usability of our method with elastic and inelastic objects with different kinds of materials. Comparisons with existing techniques are conducted on synthetic and real elastic objects with strains ranging from 25% to 130% resulting to low errors.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Haouchine_Template-Based_Monocular_3D_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Nazim Haouchine, Stephane Cotin
Temporal Action Co-Segmentation in 3D Motion Capture Data and Videos	Given two action sequences, we are interested in spotting/co-segmenting all pairs of sub-sequences that represent the same action. We propose a totally unsupervised solution to this problem. No a-priori model of the actions is assumed to be available. The number of common sub-sequences may be unknown. The sub-sequences can be located anywhere in the original sequences, may differ in duration and the corresponding actions may be performed by a different person, in different style. We treat this type of temporal action co-segmentation as a stochastic optimization problem that is solved by employing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The objective function that is minimized by PSO capitalizes on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to compare two action sub-sequences. Due to the generic problem formulation and solution, the proposed method can be applied to motion capture (i.e., 3D skeletal) data or to conventional RGB videos acquired in the wild. We present extensive quantitative experiments on standard data sets as well as on data sets we introduced in this paper. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a remarkable increase in co-segmentation quality compared to all tested state of the art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Papoutsakis_Temporal_Action_Co-Segmentation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Konstantinos Papoutsakis, Costas Panagiotakis, Antonis A.

Temporal Action Localization by Structured Maximal Sums	We address the problem of temporal action localization in videos. We pose action localization as a structured prediction over arbitrary-length temporal windows, where each window is scored as the sum of frame-wise classification scores. Additionally, our model classifies the start, middle, and end of each action as separate components, allowing our system to explicitly model each action's temporal evolution and take advantage of informative temporal dependencies present in that structure. In this framework, we localize actions by searching for the structured maximal sum, a problem for which we develop a novel, provably-efficient algorithmic solution. The frame-wise classification scores are computed using features from a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which are trained end-to-end to directly optimize for a novel structured objective. We evaluate our system on the THUMOS '14 action detection benchmark and achieve competitive performance.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yuan_Temporal_Action_Localization_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zehuan Yuan, Jonathan C.

Temporal Attention-Gated Model for Robust Sequence Classification	Typical techniques for sequence classification are designed for well-segmented sequences which have been edited to remove noisy or irrelevant parts. Therefore, such methods cannot be easily applied on noisy sequences expected in real-world applications. In this paper, we present the Temporal Attention-Gated Model (TAGM) which integrates ideas from attention models and gated recurrent networks to better deal with noisy or unsegmented sequences. Specifically, we extend the concept of attention model to measure the relevance of each observation (time step) of a sequence. We then use a novel gated recurrent network to learn the hidden representation for the final prediction. An important advantage of our approach is interpretability since the temporal attention weights provide a meaningful value for the salience of each time step in the sequence. We demonstrate the merits of our TAGM approach, both for prediction accuracy and interpretability, on three different tasks: spoken digit recognition, text-based sentiment analysis and visual event recognition.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Pei_Temporal_Attention-Gated_Model_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Wenjie Pei, Tadas Baltrusaitis, David M.J.

Temporal Convolutional Networks for Action Segmentation and Detection	The ability to identify and temporally segment fine-grained human actions throughout a video is crucial for robotics, surveillance, education, and beyond. Typical approaches decouple this problem by first extracting local spatiotemporal features from video frames and then feeding them into a temporal classifier that captures high-level temporal patterns. We describe a class of temporal models, which we call Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), that use a hierarchy of temporal convolutions to perform fine-grained action segmentation or detection. Our Encoder-Decoder TCN uses pooling and upsampling to efficiently capture long-range temporal patterns whereas our Dilated TCN uses dilated convolutions. We show that TCNs are capable of capturing action compositions, segment durations, and long-range dependencies, and are over a magnitude faster to train than competing LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Networks. We apply these models to three challenging fine-grained datasets and show large improvements over the state of the art.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lea_Temporal_Convolutional_Networks_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Colin Lea, Michael D.

Temporal Domain Neural Encoder for Video Representation Learning	We address the challenge of learning good video representations by explicitly modeling the relationship between visual concepts in time space. We propose a novel Temporal Preserving Recurrent Neural Network (TPRNN) that extracts and encodes visual dynamics with frame-level features as input. The proposed network architecture captures temporal dynamics by keeping track of the ordinal relationship of co-occurring visual concepts, and constructs video representations with their temporal order patterns. The resultant video representations effectively encode temporal information of dynamic patterns, which makes them more discriminative to human actions performed with different sequences of action patterns. We evaluate the proposed model on several real video datasets, and the results show that it successfully outperforms the baseline models. In particular, we observe significant improvement on action classes that can only be distinguished by capturing the temporal orders of action patterns.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w37/html/Hu_Temporal_Domain_Neural_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hao Hu, Zhaowen Wang, Joon-Young Lee, Zhe Lin, Guo-Jun Qi
Temporal Residual Networks for Dynamic Scene Recognition	This paper combines three contributions to establish a new state-of-the-art in dynamic scene recognition. First, we present a novel ConvNet architecture based on temporal residual units that is fully convolutional in spacetime. Our model augments spatial ResNets with convolutions across time to hierarchically add temporal residuals as the depth of the network increases. Second, existing approaches to video-based recognition are categorized and a baseline of seven previously top performing algorithms is selected for comparative evaluation on dynamic scenes. Third, we introduce a new and challenging video database of dynamic scenes that more than doubles the size of those previously available. This dataset is explicitly split into two subsets of equal size that contain videos with and without camera motion to allow for systematic study of how this variable interacts with the defining dynamics of the scene per se. Our evaluations verify the particular strengths and weaknesses of the baseline algorithms with respect to various scene classes and camera motion parameters. Finally, our temporal ResNet boosts recognition performance and establishes a new state-of-the-art on dynamic scene recognition, as well as on the complementary task of action recognition.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Feichtenhofer_Temporal_Residual_Networks_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Christoph Feichtenhofer, Axel Pinz, Richard P.

Temporal Vegetation Modelling Using Long Short-Term Memory Networks for Crop Identification From Medium-Resolution Multi-Spectral Satellite Images	Land-cover classification is one of the key problems in earth observation and extensively investigated over the recent decades. Usually, approaches concentrate on single-time and multi- or hyperspectral reflectance space- or airborne sensor measurements observed. However, land-cover classes, e.g., crops, change their reflective characteristics over time complicating classification at one observation time. Contrary, these features change in a systematic and predictive manner, which can be utilized in a multi-temporal approach. We use long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to extract temporal characteristics from a sequence of Sentinel-2 observations. We compare the performance of LSTM and other network architectures and a SVM baseline to show the effectiveness of dynamic temporal feature extraction. A large test area combined with rich ground truth labels was used for training and evaluation. Our LSTM variant achieves state-of-the art performance opening potential for further research.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w18/html/Russwurm_Temporal_Vegetation_Modelling_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Marc Russwurm, Marco Korner
Temporally Steered Gaussian Attention for Video Understanding	Recent advances in video understanding are enabling incredible developments in video search, summarization, automatic captioning and human computer interaction. Attention mechanisms are a powerful way to steer focus onto different sections of the video. Existing mechanisms are driven by prior training probabilities and require input instances of identical temporal duration. We introduce an intuitive video understanding framework which combines continuous attention mechanisms over a family of Gaussian distributions with a hierarchical based video representation. The hierarchical framework enables efficient abstract temporal representations of video. Video attributes steer the attention mechanism intelligently independent of video length. Our fully learnable end-to-end approach helps predict salient temporal regions of action/objects in the video. We demonstrate state-of-the-art captioning results on the popular MSVD, MSR-VTT and M-VAD video datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w37/html/Sah_Temporally_Steered_Gaussian_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shagan Sah, Thang Nguyen, Miguel Dominguez, Felipe Petroski Such, Raymond Ptucha
Tensor Contraction Layers for Parsimonious Deep Nets	Tensors offer a natural representation for many kinds of data frequently encountered in machine learning. Images, for example, are naturally represented as third order tensors, where the modes correspond to height, width, and channels. In particular, tensor decompositions are noted for their ability to discover multi-dimensional dependencies and produce compact low-rank approximations of data. In this paper, we explore the use of tensor contractions as neural network layers and investigate several ways to apply them to activation tensors. Specifically, we propose the Tensor Contraction Layer (TCL), the first attempt to incorporate tensor contractions as end-to-end trainable neural network layers. Applied to existing networks, TCLs reduce the dimensionality of the activation tensors and thus the number of model parameters. We evaluate the TCL on the task of image recognition, augmenting popular networks (AlexNet, VGG). The resulting models are trainable end-to-end. We evaluate TCL's performance on the task of image recognition, using the CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets, studying the effect of parameter reduction via tensor contraction on performance. We demonstrate significant model compression without significant impact on the accuracy and, in some cases, improved performance.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w29/html/Kossaifi_Tensor_Contraction_Layers_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jean Kossaifi, Aran Khanna, Zachary Lipton, Tommaso Furlanello, Anima Anandkumar
The Amazing Mysteries of the Gutter: Drawing Inferences Between Panels in Comic Book Narratives	"Visual narrative is often a combination of explicit information and judicious omissions, relying on the viewer to supply missing details. In comics, most movements in time and space are hidden in the ""gutters"" between panels. To follow the story, readers logically connect panels together by inferring unseen actions through a process called ""closure"". While computers can now describe the content of natural images, in this paper we examine whether they can understand the closure-driven narratives conveyed by stylized artwork and dialogue in comic book panels. We collect a dataset, COMICS, that consists of over 1.2 million panels (120 GB) paired with automatic textbox transcriptions. An in-depth analysis of COMICS demonstrates that neither text nor image alone can tell a comic book story, so a computer must understand both modalities to keep up with the plot. We introduce three cloze-style tasks that ask models to predict narrative and character-centric aspects of a panel given n preceding panels as context. Various deep neural architectures underperform human baselines on these tasks, suggesting that COMICS contains fundamental challenges for both vision and language."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Iyyer_The_Amazing_Mysteries_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mohit Iyyer, Varun Manjunatha, Anupam Guha, Yogarshi Vyas, Jordan Boyd-Graber, Hal Daume III, Larry S.

The First Automatic Method for Mapping the Pothole in Seagrass	There is a vital need to map seagrass ecosystems in order to determine worldwide abundance and distribution. Currently there is no established method for mapping the pothole or scars in seagrass. Detection of seagrass with optical remote sensing is challenged by the fact that light is attenuated as it passes through the water column and reflects back from the benthos. Optical remote sensing of seagrass is only possible if the water is shallow and relatively clear. In reality, coastal waters are commonly turbid, and seagrasses can grow under 10 meters of water or even deeper. One of the most precise sensors to map the seagrass disturbance is side scan sonar. Underwater acoustics mapping produces a high definition, two-dimensional sonar image of seagrass ecosystems. This paper proposes a methodology which detects seagrass potholes in sonar images. Side scan sonar images usually contain speckle noise and uneven illumination across the image. Moreover, disturbance presents complex patterns where most segmentation techniques will fail. In this paper, the quality of image is improved in the first stage using adaptive thresholding and wavelet denoising techniques. In the next step, a novel level set technique is applied to identify the pothole patterns. Our method is robust to noise and uneven illumination. Moreover it can detect the complex pothole patterns. We tested our proposed approach on a collection of underwater sonar images taken from Laguna Madre in Texas. Experimental results in comparison with the ground-truth show the efficiency of the proposed method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w3/html/Rahnemoonfar_The_First_Automatic_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Maryam Rahnemoonfar, Masoud Yari, Abdullah Rahman, Richard Kline
The Geometry of First-Returning Photons for Non-Line-Of-Sight Imaging	Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging utilizes the full 5D light transient measurements to reconstruct scenes beyond the camera's field of view. Mathematically, this requires solving an elliptical tomography problem that unmixes the shape and albedo from spatially-multiplexed measurements of the NLOS scene. In this paper, we propose a new approach for NLOS imaging by studying the properties of first-returning photons from three-bounce light paths. We show that the times of flight of first-returning photons are dependent only on the geometry of the NLOS scene and each observation is almost always generated from a single NLOS scene point. Exploiting these properties, we derive a space carving algorithm for NLOS scenes. In addition, by assuming local planarity, we derive an algorithm to localize NLOS scene points in 3D and estimate their surface normals. Our methods do not require either the full transient measurements or solving the hard elliptical tomography problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through simulations as well as real data captured from a SPAD sensor.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Tsai_The_Geometry_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chia-Yin Tsai, Kiriakos N.

The Impact of Typicality for Informative Representative Selection	In computer vision, selection of the most informative samples from a huge pool of training data in order to learn a good recognition model is an active research problem. Furthermore, it is also useful to reduce the annotation cost, as it is time consuming to annotate unlabeled samples. In this paper, motivated by the theories in data compression, we propose a novel sample selection strategy which exploits the concept of typicality from the domain of information theory. Typicality is a simple and powerful technique which can be applied to compress the training data to learn a good classification model. In this work, typicality is used to identify a subset of the most informative samples for labeling, which is then used to update the model using active learning. The proposed model can take advantage of the inter-relationships between data samples. Our approach leads to a significant reduction of manual labeling cost while achieving similar or better recognition performance compared to a model trained with entire training set. This is demonstrated through rigorous experimentation on five datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Bappy_The_Impact_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jawadul H.

The Incremental Multiresolution Matrix Factorization Algorithm	"Multiresolution analysis and matrix factorization are foundational tools in computer vision. In this work, we study the interface between these two distinct topics and obtain techniques to uncover hierarchical block structure in symmetric matrices -- an important aspect in the success of many vision problems. Our new algorithm, the incremental multiresolution matrix factorization, uncovers such structure one feature at a time, and hence scales well to large matrices. We describe how this multiscale analysis goes much farther than what a direct ""global"" factorization of the data can identify. We evaluate the efficacy of the resulting factorizations for relative leveraging within regression tasks using medical imaging data. We also use the factorization on representations learned by popular deep networks, providing evidence of their ability to infer semantic relationships even when they are not explicitly trained to do so. We show that this algorithm can be used as an exploratory tool to improve the network architecture, and within numerous other settings in vision."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ithapu_The_Incremental_Multiresolution_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Vamsi K.

The Misty Three Point Algorithm for Relative Pose	There is a significant interest in scene reconstruction from underwater images given its utility for oceanic research and for recreational image manipulation. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for two view camera motion estimation for underwater imagery. Our method leverages the constraints provided by the attenuation properties of water and its effects on the appearance of the color to determine the depth difference of a point with respect to the two observing views of the underwater cameras. Additionally, we propose an algorithm, leveraging the depth differences of three such observed points, to estimate the relative pose of the cameras. Given the unknown underwater attenuation coefficients, our method estimates the relative motion up to scale. The results are represented as a generalized camera. We evaluate our method on both real data and simulated data.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Palmer_The_Misty_Three_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tobias Palmer, Kalle Astrom, Jan-Michael Frahm
The More You Know: Using Knowledge Graphs for Image Classification	One characteristic that sets humans apart from modern learning-based computer vision algorithms is the ability to acquire knowledge about the world and use that knowledge to reason about the visual world. Humans can learn about the characteristics of objects and the relationships that occur between them to learn a large variety of visual concepts, often with few examples. This paper investigates the use of structured prior knowledge in the form of knowledge graphs and shows that using this knowledge improves performance on image classification. We build on recent work on end-to-end learning on graphs, introducing the Graph Search Neural Network as a way of efficiently incorporating large knowledge graphs into a vision classification pipeline. We show in a number of experiments that our method outperforms standard neural network baselines for multi-label classification.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Marino_The_More_You_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Kenneth Marino, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Abhinav Gupta
The One Hundred Layers Tiramisu: Fully Convolutional DenseNets for Semantic Segmentation	State-of-the-art approaches for semantic image segmentation are built on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The typical segmentation architecture is composed of (a) a downsampling path responsible for extracting coarse semantic features, followed by (b) an upsampling path trained to recover the input image resolution at the output of the model and, optionally, (c) a post-processing module (e.g. Conditional Random Fields) to refine the model predictions. Recently, a new CNN architecture, Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), has shown excellent results on image classification tasks. The idea of DenseNets is based on the observation that if each layer is directly connected to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion then the network will be more accurate and easier to train. In this paper, we extend DenseNets to deal with the problem of semantic segmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art results on urban scene benchmark datasets such as CamVid and Gatech, without any further post-processing module nor pretraining. Moreover, due to smart construction of the model, our approach has much less parameters than currently published best entries for these datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w13/html/Jegou_The_One_Hundred_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Simon Jegou, Michal Drozdzal, David Vazquez, Adriana Romero, Yoshua Bengio
The Role of Synchronic Causal Conditions in Visual Knowledge Learning	"We propose a principled approach for the learning of causal conditions from actions and activities taking place in the physical environment through visual input. Causal conditions are the preconditions that must exist before a certain effect can ensue. We propose to consider diachronic and synchronic causal conditions separately for the learning of causal knowledge. Diachronic condition captures the ""change"" aspect of the causal relationship - what change must be present at a certain time to effect a subsequent change - while the synchronic condition is the ""contextual"" aspect - what ""static"" condition must be present to enable the causal relationship involved. This paper focuses on discussing the learning of synchronic causal conditions as well as proposing a principled framework for the learning of causal knowledge including the learning of extended sequences of cause-effect and the encoding of this knowledge in the form of scripts for prediction and problem solving."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w1/html/Ho_The_Role_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Seng-Beng Ho
The Square Root Velocity Framework for Curves in a Homogeneous Space	In this paper we study the shape space of curves with values in a homogeneous space M = G/K, where G is a Lie group and K is a compact Lie subgroup. We generalize the square root velocity framework to obtain a reparametrization invariant metric on the space of curves in M. By identifying curves in M with their horizontal lifts in G, geodesics then can be computed. We can also mod out by reparametrizations and by rigid motions of M. In each of these quotient spaces, we can compute Karcher means, geodesics, and perform principal component analysis. We present numerical examples including the analysis of a set of hurricane paths.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w7/html/Su_The_Square_Root_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhe Su, Eric Klassen, Martin Bauer
The Stereoscopic Zoom	"We study camera models to generate stereoscopic zoom shots, i.e. using very long focal length lenses. Stereoscopic images are usually generated with two cameras. However, we show that two cameras are unable to create compelling stereoscopic images for extreme focal length lenses. Inspired by the practitioners' use of the long focal length lenses we propose two different configurations: we ""get closer"" to the scene, or we create ""perspective deformations"". Both configurations are build upon state-of-the-art image-based rendering methods allowing the formal deduction of precise parameters of the cameras depending on the scene to be acquired. We present a proof of concept with the acquisition of a representative simplified scene. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of each configuration."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w15/html/Pujades_The_Stereoscopic_Zoom_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Sergi Pujades, Frederic Devernay, Laurent Boiron, Remi Ronfard
The Surfacing of Multiview 3D Drawings via Lofting and Occlusion Reasoning	The three-dimensional reconstruction of scenes from multiple views has made impressive strides in recent years, chiefly by methods correlating isolated feature points, intensities, or curvilinear structure. In the general setting, i.e., without requiring controlled acquisition, limited number of objects, abundant patterns on objects, or object curves to follow particular models, the majority of these methods produce unorganized point clouds, meshes, or voxel representations of the reconstructed scene, with some exceptions producing 3D drawings as networks of curves. Many applications, e.g., robotics, urban planning, industrial design, and hard surface modeling, however, require structured representations which make explicit 3D curves, surfaces, and their spatial relationships. Reconstructing surface representations can now be constrained by the 3D drawing acting like a scaffold to hang on the computed representations, leading to increased robustness and quality of reconstruction. This paper presents one way of completing such 3D drawings with surface reconstructions, by exploring occlusion reasoning through lofting algorithms.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Usumezbas_The_Surfacing_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Anil Usumezbas, Ricardo Fabbri, Benjamin B.

The VQA-Machine: Learning How to Use Existing Vision Algorithms to Answer New Questions	One of the most intriguing features of the Visual Question Answering (VQA) challenge is the unpredictability of the questions. Extracting the information required to answer them demands a variety of image operations from detection and counting, to segmentation and reconstruction. To train a method to perform even one of these operations accurately from image,question,answer tuples would be challenging, but to aim to achieve them all with a limited set of such training data seems ambitious at best. Our method thus learns how to exploit a set of external off-the-shelf algorithms to achieve its goal, an approach that has something in common with the Neural Turing Machine. The core of our proposed method is a new co-attention model. In addition, the proposed approach generates human-readable reasons for its decision, and can still be trained end-to-end without ground truth reasons being given. We demonstrate the effectiveness on two publicly available datasets, Visual Genome and VQA, and show that it produces the state-of-the-art results in both cases.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_The_VQA-Machine_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Peng Wang, Qi Wu, Chunhua Shen, Anton van den Hengel
The World of Fast Moving Objects	The notion of a Fast Moving Object (FMO), i.e. an object that moves over a distance exceeding its size within the exposure time, is introduced. FMOs may, and typically do, rotate with high angular speed. FMOs are very common in sports videos, but are not rare elsewhere. In a single frame, such objects are often barely visible and appear as semitransparent streaks. A method for the detection and tracking of FMOs is proposed. The method consists of three distinct algorithms, which form an efficient localization pipeline that operates successfully in a broad range of conditions. We show that it is possible to recover the appearance of the object and its axis of rotation, despite its blurred appearance. The proposed method is evaluated on a new annotated dataset. The results show that existing trackers are inadequate for the problem of FMO localization and a new approach is required. Two applications of localization, temporal superresolution and highlighting, are presented.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Rozumnyi_The_World_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Denys Rozumnyi, Jan Kotera, Filip Sroubek, Lukas Novotny, Jiri Matas
Thin-Slicing Network: A Deep Structured Model for Pose Estimation in Videos	Deep ConvNets have been shown to be effective for the task of human pose estimation from single images. However, several challenging issues arise in the video-based case such as self-occlusion, motion blur, and uncommon poses with few or no examples in the training data. Temporal information can provide additional cues about the location of body joints and help to alleviate these issues. In this paper, we propose a deep structured model to estimate a sequence of human poses in unconstrained videos. This model can be efficiently trained in an end-to-end manner and is capable of representing the appearance of body joints and their spatio-temporal relationships simultaneously. Domain knowledge about the human body is explicitly incorporated into the network providing effective priors to regularize the skeletal structure and to enforce temporal consistency. The proposed end-to-end architecture is evaluated on two widely used benchmarks for video-based pose estimation (Penn Action and JHMDB datasets). Our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Song_Thin-Slicing_Network_A_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jie Song, Limin Wang, Luc Van Gool, Otmar Hilliges
Time-Contrastive Networks: Self-Supervised Learning From Multi-View Observation	We propose a self-supervised approach for learning representations of relationships between humans and their environment, including object interactions, attributes, and body pose, entirely from unlabeled videos recorded from multiple viewpoints. We train our representation as an embedding with a triplet loss that opposes simultaneous frames from different viewpoints against temporally adjacent and visually similar frames. This opposition allows to disambiguate the possible explanations for temporal changes in the world. We demonstrate that our model can correctly identify corresponding steps in complex object interactions, such as pouring, between different videos and with different instances. We also show what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first self-supervised results for end-to-end imitation learning of human motions with a real robot.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w5/html/Sermanet_Time-Contrastive_Networks_Self-Supervised_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Pierre Sermanet, Corey Lynch, Jasmine Hsu, Sergey Levine
Top-Down Visual Saliency Guided by Captions	Neural image/video captioning models can generate accurate descriptions, but their internal process of mapping regions to words is a black box and therefore difficult to explain. Top-down neural saliency methods can find important regions given a high-level semantic task such as object classification, but cannot use a natural language sentence as the top-down input for the task. In this paper, we propose Caption-Guided Visual Saliency to expose the region-to-word mapping in modern encoder-decoder networks and demonstrate that it is learned implicitly from caption training data, without any pixel-level annotations. Our approach can produce spatial or spatiotemporal heatmaps for both predicted captions, and for arbitrary query sentences. It recovers saliency without the overhead of introducing explicit attention layers, and can be used to analyze a variety of existing model architectures and improve their design. Evaluation on large-scale video and image datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves comparable captioning performance with existing methods while providing more accurate saliency heatmaps. Our code is available at visionlearninggroup.github.io/caption-guided-saliency/	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ramanishka_Top-Down_Visual_Saliency_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Vasili Ramanishka, Abir Das, Jianming Zhang, Kate Saenko
Toroidal Constraints for Two-Point Localization Under High Outlier Ratios	Localizing a query image against a 3D model at large scale is a hard problem, since 2D-3D matches become more and more ambiguous as the model size increases. This creates a need for pose estimation strategies that can handle very low inlier ratios. In this paper, we draw new insights on the geometric information available from the 2D-3D matching process. As modern descriptors are not invariant against large variations in viewpoint, we are able to find the rays in space used to triangulate a given point that are closest to a query descriptor. It is well known that two correspondences constrain the camera to lie on the surface of a torus. Adding the knowledge of direction of triangulation, we are able to approximate the position of the camera from two matches alone. We derive a geometric solver that can compute this position in under 1 microsecond. Using this solver, we propose a simple yet powerful outlier filter which scales quadratically in the number of matches. We validate the accuracy of our solver and demonstrate the usefulness of our method in real world settings.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Camposeco_Toroidal_Constraints_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Federico Camposeco, Torsten Sattler, Andrea Cohen, Andreas Geiger, Marc Pollefeys
Toward Open-Set Face Recognition	Much research has been conducted on both face identification and face verification, with greater focus on the latter. Research on face identification has mostly focused on using closed-set protocols, which assume that all probe images used in evaluation contain identities of subjects that are enrolled in the gallery. Real systems, however, where only a fraction of probe sample identities are enrolled in the gallery, cannot make this closed-set assumption. Instead, they must assume an open set of probe samples and be able to reject/ignore those that correspond to unknown identities. In this paper, we address the widespread misconception that thresholding verification-like scores is a good way to solve the open-set face identification problem, by formulating an open-set face identification protocol and evaluating different strategies for assessing similarity. Our open-set identification protocol is based on the canonical labeled faces in the wild (LFW) dataset. Additionally to the known identities, we introduce the concepts of known unknowns (known, but uninteresting persons) and unknown unknowns (people never seen before) to the biometric community. We compare three algorithms for assessing similarity in a deep feature space under an open-set protocol: thresholded verification-like scores, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) scores, and an extreme value machine (EVM) probabilities. Our findings suggest that thresholding EVM probabilities, which are open-set by design, outperforms thresholding verification-like scores.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w6/html/Gunther_Toward_Open-Set_Face_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Manuel Gunther, Steve Cruz, Ethan M.

Towards Accurate Multi-Person Pose Estimation in the Wild	We propose a method for multi-person detection and 2-D pose estimation that achieves state-of-art results on the challenging COCO keypoints task. It is a simple, yet powerful, top-down approach consisting of two stages. In the first stage, we predict the location and scale of boxes which are likely to contain people; for this we use the Faster RCNN detector. In the second stage, we estimate the keypoints of the person potentially contained in each proposed bounding box. For each keypoint type we predict dense heatmaps and offsets using a fully convolutional ResNet. To combine these outputs we introduce a novel aggregation procedure to obtain highly localized keypoint predictions. We also use a novel form of keypoint-based Non-Maximum-Suppression (NMS), instead of the cruder box-level NMS, and a novel form of keypoint-based confidence score estimation, instead of box-level scoring. Trained on COCO data alone, our final system achieves average precision of 0.649 on the COCO test-dev set and the 0.643 test-standard sets, outperforming the winner of the 2016 COCO keypoints challenge and other recent state-of-art. Further, by using additional in-house labeled data we obtain an even higher average precision of 0.685 on the test-dev set and 0.673 on the test-standard set, more than 5% absolute improvement compared to the previous best performing method on the same dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Papandreou_Towards_Accurate_Multi-Person_CVPR_2017_paper.html	George Papandreou, Tyler Zhu, Nori Kanazawa, Alexander Toshev, Jonathan Tompson, Chris Bregler, Kevin Murphy
Towards a Principled Integration of Multi-Camera Re-Identification and Tracking Through Optimal Bayes Filters	With the rise of end-to-end learning through deep learning, person detectors and re-identification (ReID) models have recently become very strong. Multi-camera multi-target (MCMT) tracking has not fully gone through this transformation yet. We intend to take another step in this direction by presenting a theoretically principled way of integrating ReID with tracking formulated as an optimal Bayes filter. This conveniently side-steps the need for data-association and opens up a direct path from full images to the core of the tracker. While the results are still sub-par, we believe that this new, tight integration opens many interesting research opportunities and leads the way towards full end-to-end tracking from raw pixels.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w17/html/Beyer_Towards_a_Principled_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Lucas Beyer, Stefan Breuers, Vitaly Kurin, Bastian Leibe
Towards a Quality Metric for Dense Light Fields	Light fields become a popular representation of three-dimensional scenes, and there is interest in their processing, resampling, and compression. As those operations often result in loss of quality, there is a need to quantify it. In this work, we collect a new dataset of dense reference and distorted light fields as well as the corresponding quality scores which are scaled in perceptual units. The scores were acquired in a subjective experiment using an interactive light-field viewing setup. The dataset contains typical artifacts that occur in light-field processing chain due to light-field reconstruction, multi-view compression, and limitations of automultiscopic displays. We test a number of existing objective quality metrics to determine how well they can predict the quality of light fields. We find that the existing image quality metrics provide good measures of light-field quality, but require dense reference light- fields for optimal performance. For more complex tasks of comparing two distorted light fields, their performance drops significantly, which reveals the need for new, light-field-specific metrics.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Adhikarla_Towards_a_Quality_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Vamsi Kiran Adhikarla, Marek Vinkler, Denis Sumin, Rafal K.

Track-Clustering Error Evaluation for Track-Based Multi-Camera Tracking System Employing Human Re-Identification	In this study, we present a set of new evaluation measures for the track-based multi-camera tracking (T-MCT) task leveraging the clustering measurements. We demonstrate that the proposed evaluation measures provide notable advantages over previous ones. Moreover, a distributed and online T-MCT framework is proposed, where re-identification (Re-id) is embedded in T-MCT, to confirm the validity of the proposed evaluation measures. Experimental results reveal that with the proposed evaluation measures, the performance of T-MCT can be accurately measured, which is highly correlated to the performance of Re-id. Furthermore, it is also noted that our T-MCT framework achieves competitive score on the DukeMTMC dataset when compared to the previous work that used global optimization algorithms. Both the evaluation measures and the inter-camera tracking framework are proven to be the stepping stone for multi-camera tracking.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w17/html/Wu_Track-Clustering_Error_Evaluation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chih-Wei Wu, Meng-Ting Zhong, Yu Tsao, Shao-Wen Yang, Yen-Kuang Chen, Shao-Yi Chien
Tracking by Natural Language Specification	This paper strives to track a target object in a video. Rather than specifying the target in the first frame of a video by a bounding box, we propose to track the object based on a natural language specification of the target, which provides a more natural human-machine interaction as well as a means to improve tracking results. We define three variants of tracking by language specification: one relying on lingual target specification only, one relying on visual target specification based on language, and one leveraging their joint capacity. To show the potential of tracking by natural language specification we extend two popular tracking datasets with lingual descriptions and report experiments. Finally, we also sketch new tracking scenarios in surveillance and other live video streams that become feasible with a lingual specification of the target.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Li_Tracking_by_Natural_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhenyang Li, Ran Tao, Efstratios Gavves, Cees G.

Training Object Class Detectors With Click Supervision	Training object class detectors typically requires a large set of images with objects annotated by bounding boxes. However, manually drawing bounding boxes is very time consuming. In this paper we greatly reduce annotation time by proposing center-click annotations: we ask annotators to click on the center of an imaginary bounding box which tightly encloses the object instance. We then incorporate these clicks into existing Multiple Instance Learning techniques for weakly supervised object localization, to jointly localize object bounding boxes over all training images. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 and MS COCO show that: (1) our scheme delivers high-quality detectors, performing substantially better than those produced by weakly supervised techniques, with a modest extra annotation effort; (2) these detectors in fact perform in a range close to those trained from manually drawn bounding boxes; (3) as the center-click task is very fast, our scheme reduces total annotation time by 9x to 18x.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Papadopoulos_Training_Object_Class_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Dim P.

Training Sparse Neural Networks	The emergence of Deep neural networks has seen human-level performance on large scale computer vision tasks such as image classification. However these deep networks typically contain large amount of parameters due to dense matrix multiplications and convolutions. As a result, these architectures are highly memory intensive, making them less suitable for embedded vision applications. Sparse Computations are known to be much more memory efficient. In this work, we train and build neural networks which implicitly use sparse computations. We introduce additional gate variables to perform parameter selection and show that this is equivalent to using a spike-and-slab prior. We experimentally validate our method on both small and large networks which result in highly sparse neural network models.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w4/html/Srinivas_Training_Sparse_Neural_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Suraj Srinivas, Akshayvarun Subramanya, R.

Trajectory Ensemble: Multiple Persons Consensus Tracking Across Non-Overlapping Multiple Cameras Over Randomly Dropped Camera Networks	"Multiple person tracking over a camera network is usually performed by matching person images between adjacent cameras. It easily fails by a temporal appearance change of the persons caused by environmental illumination and observation orientation of a camera. To solve this problem, matching person images across not only adjacent cameras but also cameras multiple hops away in the camera network is effective, however, such relaxation of spatio-temporal cues also cause tracking failure due to the increase of matching candidates. To avoid the failure, we introduce ""Random Camera Drop"" to generate different camera networks which relax the spatio-temporal cues partially and randomly. And we integrate tracking results over the networks to a consensus tracking result by a novel concept ""Trajectory Ensemble"", an extension of unsupervised ensemble learning for the multiple person tracking over a camera network problem. We evaluated the framework on several virtual datasets generated from a public dataset, ""Shinpuhkan 2014 dataset"" and confirmed that the proposed method achieve the highest tracking results among some comparative methods."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w17/html/Kawanishi_Trajectory_Ensemble_Multiple_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yasutomo Kawanishi, Daisuke Deguchi, Ichiro Ide, Hiroshi Murase
Transfer Learning Based Evolutionary Algorithm for Composite Face Sketch Recognition	Matching facial sketches to digital face images has widespread application in law enforcement scenarios. Recent advancements in technology have led to the availability of sketch generation tools, minimizing the requirement of a sketch artist. While these sketches have helped in manual authentication, matching composite sketches with digital mugshot photos automatically show high modality gap. This research aims to address the task of matching a composite face sketch image to digital images by proposing a transfer learning based evolutionary algorithm. A new feature descriptor, Histogram of Image Moments, has also been presented for encoding features across modalities. Moreover, IIITD Composite Face Sketch Database of 150 subjects is presented to fill the gap due to limited availability of databases in this problem domain. Experimental evaluation and analysis on the proposed dataset show the effectiveness of the transfer learning approach for performing cross-modality recognition.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w6/html/Chugh_Transfer_Learning_Based_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tarang Chugh, Maneet Singh, Shruti Nagpal, Richa Singh, Mayank Vatsa
Transferable Deep-CNN Features for Detecting Digital and Print-Scanned Morphed Face Images	Face biometrics is widely used in various applications including border control and facilitating the verification of travellers' identity claim with respect to his electronic passport (ePass). As in most countries, passports are issued to a citizen based on the submitted photo which allows the applicant to provide a morphed face photo to conceal his identity during the application process. In this work, we propose a novel approach leveraging the transferable features from a pre-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (D-CNN) to detect both digital and print-scanned morphed face image. Thus, the proposed approach is based on the feature level fusion of the first fully connected layers of two D-CNN (VGG19 and AlexNet) that are specifically fine-tuned using the morphed face image database. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on the newly constructed database with both digital and print-scanned morphed face images corresponding to bona fide and morphed data reflecting a real-life scenario. The obtained results consistently demonstrate improved detection performance of the proposed scheme over previously proposed methods on both the digital and the print-scanned morphed face image database.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w28/html/Busch_Transferable_Deep-CNN_Features_CVPR_2017_paper.html	R.

Transferring Microscopy Image Modalities With Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks	Phase Contrast (PC) and Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy are two popular noninvasive techniques for monitoring live cells. Each of these two image modalities has its own advantages and disadvantages to visualize specimens. In this paper, we investigate a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (conditional GAN) which contains one generator and two discriminators to transfer microscopy image modalities. Given a training dataset consisting of pairs of images (source and destination) captured on the same set of specimens by DIC and Phase Contrast microscopes, we can train a conditional GAN, and with this well-trained GAN, we can generate the corresponding Phase Contrast image given a new DIC image, vice versa. The preliminary experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms one state-of-the-arts method, and can provide biologists a computational way to switch between microscopy image modalities.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w8/html/Han_Transferring_Microscopy_Image_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Liang Han, Zhaozheng Yin
Transformation-Grounded Image Generation Network for Novel 3D View Synthesis	We present a transformation-grounded image generation network for novel 3D view synthesis from a single image. Our approach first explicitly infers the parts of the geometry visible both in the input and novel views and then casts the remaining synthesis problem as image completion. Specifically, we both predict a flow to move the pixels from the input to the novel view along with a novel visibility map that helps deal with occulsion/disocculsion. Next, conditioned on those intermediate results, we hallucinate (infer) parts of the object invisible in the input image. In addition to the new network structure, training with a combination of adversarial and perceptual loss results in a reduction in common artifacts of novel view synthesis such as distortions and holes, while successfully generating high frequency details and preserving visual aspects of the input image. We evaluate our approach on a wide range of synthetic and real examples. Both qualitative and quantitative results show our method achieves significantly better results compared to existing methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Park_Transformation-Grounded_Image_Generation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Eunbyung Park, Jimei Yang, Ersin Yumer, Duygu Ceylan, Alexander C.

Transition Forests: Learning Discriminative Temporal Transitions for Action Recognition and Detection	A human action can be seen as transitions between one's body poses over time, where the transition depicts a temporal relation between two poses. Recognizing actions thus involves learning a classifier sensitive to these pose transitions as well as to static poses. In this paper, we introduce a novel method called transitions forests, an ensemble of decision trees that both learn to discriminate static poses and transitions between pairs of two independent frames. During training, node splitting is driven by alternating two criteria: the standard classification objective that maximizes the discrimination power in individual frames, and the proposed one in pairwise frame transitions. Growing the trees tends to group frames that have similar associated transitions and share same action label incorporating temporal information that was not available otherwise. Unlike conventional decision trees where the best split in a node is determined independently of other nodes, the transition forests try to find the best split of nodes jointly (within a layer) for incorporating distant node transitions. When inferring the class label of a new frame, it is passed down the trees and the prediction is made based on previous frame predictions and the current one in an efficient and online manner. We apply our method on varied skeleton action recognition and online detection datasets showing its suitability over several baselines and state-of-the-art approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Garcia-Hernando_Transition_Forests_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Guillermo Garcia-Hernando, Tae-Kyun Kim
Truncated Max-Of-Convex Models	Truncated convex models (TCM) are a special case of pair- wise random fields that have been widely used in computer vision. However, by restricting the order of the potentials to be at most two, they fail to capture useful image statistics. We propose a natural generalization of TCM to high-order random fields, which we call truncated max-of-convex models (TMCM). The energy function of TMCM consists of two types of potentials: (i) unary potential, which has no restriction on its form; and (ii) high-order potential, which is the sum of the truncation of the m largest convex distances over disjoint pairs of random variables in an arbitrary size clique. The use of a convex distance function encourages smoothness, while truncation allows for discontinuities in the labeling. By using m > 1, TMCM provides robustness towards errors in the definition of the cliques. In order to minimize the energy function of a TMCM over all possible labelings, we design an efficient st-mincut based range expansion algorithm. We prove the accuracy of our algorithm by establishing strong multiplicative bounds for several special cases of interest. Using synthetic and standard real datasets, we demonstrate the benefit of our high-order TMCM over pairwise TCM, as well as the benefit of our range expansion algorithm over other st-mincut based approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Pansari_Truncated_Max-Of-Convex_Models_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Pankaj Pansari, M.

Trusting the Computer in Computer Vision: A Privacy-Affirming Framework	The use of surveillance cameras continues to increase, ranging from conventional applications such as law enforcement to newer scenarios with looser requirements such as gathering business intelligence. Humans still play an integral part in using and interpreting the footage from these systems, but are also a significant factor in causing unintentional privacy breaches. As computer vision methods continue to improve, we argue in this position paper that system designers should reconsider the role of machines in surveillance, and how automation can be used to help protect privacy. We explore this by discussing the impact of the human-in-the-loop, the potential for using abstraction and distributed computing to further privacy goals, and an approach for determining when video footage should be hidden from human users. We propose that in an ideal surveillance scenario, a privacy-affirming framework causes collected camera footage to be processed by computers directly, and never shown to humans. This implicitly requires humans to establish trust, to believe that computer vision systems can generate sufficiently accurate results without human supervision, so that if information about people must be gathered, unintentional data collection is mitigated as much as possible.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w16/html/Wang_Trusting_the_Computer_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Andrew Tzer-Yeu Chen; Morteza Biglari-Abhari; Kevin I-Kai Wang

Turning an Urban Scene Video Into a Cinemagraph	This paper proposes an algorithm that turns a regular video capturing urban scenes into a high-quality endless animation, known as a Cinemagraph. The creation of a Cinemagraph usually requires a static camera in a carefully configured scene. The task becomes challenging for a regular video with a moving camera and objects. Our approach first warps an input video into the viewpoint of a reference camera. Based on the warped video, we propose effective temporal analysis algorithms to detect regions with static geometry and dynamic appearance, where geometric modeling is reliable and visually attractive animations can be created. Lastly, the algorithm applies a sequence of video processing techniques to produce a Cinemagraph movie. We have tested the proposed approach on numerous challenging real scenes. To our knowledge, this work is the first to automatically generate Cinemagraph animations from regular movies in the wild.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yan_Turning_an_Urban_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hang Yan, Yebin Liu, Yasutaka Furukawa
Two-Stream Neural Networks for Tampered Face Detection	We propose a two-stream network for face tampering detection. We train GoogLeNet to detect tampering artifacts in a face classification stream, and train a patch based triplet network to leverage features capturing local noise residuals and camera characteristics as a second stream. In addition, we use two different online face swaping applications to create a new dataset that consists of 2010 tampered images, each of which contains a tampered face. We evaluate the proposed two-stream network on our newly collected dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectness of our method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w28/html/Davis_Two-Stream_Neural_Networks_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Peng Zhou; Xintong Han; Vlad I.

Ubernet: Training a Universal Convolutional Neural Network for Low-, Mid-, and High-Level Vision Using Diverse Datasets and Limited Memory	"In this work we train in an end-to-end manner a convolutional neural network (CNN) that jointly handles low-, mid-, and high-level vision tasks in a unified architecture. Such a network can act like a `swiss knife' for vision tasks; we call it an ""UberNet"" to indicate its overarching nature. The main contribution of this work consists in handling challenges that emerge when scaling up to many tasks. We introduce techniques that facilitate (i) training a deep architecture while relying on diverse training sets and (ii) training many (potentially unlimited) tasks with a limited memory budget. This allows us to train in an end-to-end manner a unified CNN architecture that jointly handles (a) boundary detection (b) normal estimation (c) saliency estimation (d) semantic segmentation (e) human part segmentation (f) semantic boundary detection, (g) region proposal generation and object detection. We obtain competitive performance while jointly addressing all tasks in 0.7 seconds on a GPU.

UltraStereo: Efficient Learning-Based Matching for Active Stereo Systems	Efficient estimation of depth from pairs of stereo images is one of the core problems in computer vision. We efficiently solve the specialized problem of stereo matching under active illumination using a new learning-based algorithm. This type of 'active' stereo i.e. stereo matching where scene texture is augmented by an active light projector is proving compelling for designing depth cameras, largely due to improved robustness when compared to time of flight or traditional structured light techniques. Our algorithm uses an unsupervised greedy optimization scheme that learns features that are discriminative for estimating correspondences in infrared images. The proposed method optimizes a series of sparse hyperplanes that are used at test time to remap all the image patches into a compact binary representation in O(1). The proposed algorithm is cast in a PatchMatch Stereo-like framework, producing depth maps at 500Hz. In contrast to standard structured light methods, our approach generalizes to different scenes, does not require tedious per camera calibration procedures and is not adversely affected by interference from overlapping sensors. Extensive evaluations show we surpass the quality and overcome the limitations of current depth sensing technologies.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Fanello_UltraStereo_Efficient_Learning-Based_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Sean Ryan Fanello, Julien Valentin, Christoph Rhemann, Adarsh Kowdle, Vladimir Tankovich, Philip Davidson, Shahram Izadi
Unambiguous Text Localization and Retrieval for Cluttered Scenes	Text instance as one category of self-described objects provides valuable information for understanding and describing cluttered scenes. In this paper, we explore the task of unambiguous text localization and retrieval, to accurately localize a specific targeted text instance in a cluttered image given a natural language description that refers to it. To address this issue, first a novel recurrent Dense Text Localization Network (DTLN) is proposed to sequentially decode the intermediate convolutional representations of a cluttered scene image into a set of distinct text instance detections. Our approach avoids repeated detections at multiple scales of the same text instance by recurrently memorizing previous detections, and effectively tackles crowded text instances in close proximity. Second, we propose a Context Reasoning Text Retrieval (CRTR) model, which jointly encodes text instances and their context information through a recurrent network, and ranks localized text bounding boxes by a scoring function of context compatibility. Quantitative evaluations on standard scene text localization benchmarks and a newly collected scene text retrieval dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our models for both scene text localization and retrieval.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Rong_Unambiguous_Text_Localization_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xuejian Rong, Chucai Yi, Yingli Tian
Uncertainty Quantification of Lucas Kanade Feature Track and Application to Visual Odometry	An uncertainty quantification approach to estimate the errors incurred by the Kanade Lucas Tomasi (KLT) feature tracking algorithm is presented. The covariance analysis is based on the linearized sensitivity calculations of the KLT algorithm. Track uncertainty thus computed is utilized to quantify the errors associated with feature based relative pose estimation algorithms. This paper also show that the uncertainty analysis result can serve as a mean to measures reliability of feature correspondences. Proposed technique show that a large amount of outlier can be ejected effectively, and thus improve the efficiency of iterative method such as RANSAC.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w10/html/Wong_Uncertainty_Quantification_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xue Iuan Wong, Manoranjan Majji
Unconstrained Face Alignment Without Face Detection	This paper introduces our submission to the 2nd Facial Landmark Localisation Competition. We present a deep architecture to directly detect facial landmarks without using face detection as an initialization. The architecture consists of two stages, a Basic Landmark Prediction Stage and a Whole Landmark Regression Stage. At the former stage, given an input image, the basic landmarks of all faces are detected by a sub-network of landmark heatmap and affinity field prediction. At the latter stage, the coarse canonical face and the pose can be generated by a Pose Splitting Layer based on the visible basic landmarks. According to its pose, each canonical state is distributed to the corresponding branch of the shape regression sub-networks for the whole landmark detection. Experimental results show that our method obtains promising results on the 300-W dataset, and achieves superior performances over the baselines of the semi-frontal and the profile categories in this competition.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w33/html/Shao_Unconstrained_Face_Alignment_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xiaohu Shao, Junliang Xing, Jiangjing Lv, Chunlin Xiao, Pengcheng Liu, Youji Feng, Cheng Cheng
Understanding Traffic Density From Large-Scale Web Camera Data	Understanding traffic density from large-scale web camera (webcam) videos is a challenging problem because such videos have low spatial and temporal resolution, high occlusion and large perspective. To deeply understand traffic density, we explore both optimization based and deep learning based methods. To avoid individual vehicle detection or tracking, both methods map the dense image feature into vehicle density, one based on rank constrained regression and the other based on fully convolutional networks (FCN). The regression based method learns different weights for different blocks of the image to embed road geometry and significantly reduce the error induced by camera perspective. The FCN based method jointly estimates vehicle density and vehicle count with a residual learning framework to perform end-to-end dense prediction, allowing arbitrary image resolution, and adapting to different vehicle scales and perspectives. We analyze and compare both methods, and get insights from optimization based method to improve deep model. Since existing datasets do not cover all the challenges in our work, we collected and labelled a large-scale traffic video dataset, containing 60 million frames from 212 webcams. Both methods are extensively evaluated and compared on different counting tasks and datasets. FCN based method significantly reduces the mean absolute error (MAE) from 10.99 to 5.31 on the public dataset TRANCOS compared with the state-of-the-art baseline.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Understanding_Traffic_Density_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shanghang Zhang, Guanhang Wu, Joao P.

Underwater Image Dehazing With a Light Field Camera	Underwater vision is subject to effects of underwater light propagation that act to absorb, scatter, and attenuate light rays between the scene and the imaging platform. Backscattering has been shown to have a strong impact on underwater images. As light interacts with particulate matter in the water column, it is scattered back towards the imaging sensor, resulting in a hazy effect across the image. A similar effect occurs in terrestrial applications in images of foggy scenes due to interaction with the atmosphere. Prior work on multi-image dehazing has relied on multiple cameras, polarization filters, or moving light sources. Single image dehazing is an ill-posed problem; proposed solutions rely on strong priors of the scene. This paper presents a novel method for underwater image dehazing using a light field camera to capture both the spatial and angular distribution of light across a scene. First, a 2D dehazing method is applied to each sub-aperture image. These dehazed images are then combined to produce a smoothed central view. Lastly, the smoothed central view is used as a reference to perform guided image filtering, resulting in a 4D dehazed underwater light field image. The developed method is validated on real light field data collected in a controlled in-lab water tank, with images taken in air for reference. This dataset is made publicly available.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w27/html/Skinner_Underwater_Image_Dehazing_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Katherine A.

Unified Embedding and Metric Learning for Zero-Exemplar Event Detection	Event detection in unconstrained videos is conceived as a content-based video retrieval with two modalities: textual and visual. Given a text describing a novel event, the goal is to rank related videos accordingly. This task is zero-exemplar, no video examples are given to the novel event. Related works train a bank of concept detectors on external data sources. These detectors predict confidence scores for test videos, which are ranked and retrieved accordingly. In contrast, we learn a joint space in which the visual and textual representations are embedded. The space casts a novel event as a probability of pre-defined events. Also, it learns to measure the distance between an event and its related videos. Our model is trained end-to-end on publicly available EventNet. When applied to TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection dataset, it outperforms the state-of-the-art by a considerable margin.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Hussein_Unified_Embedding_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Noureldien Hussein, Efstratios Gavves, Arnold W.M.

Unite the People: Closing the Loop Between 3D and 2D Human Representations	"3D models provide a common ground for different representations of human bodies. In turn, robust 2D estimation has proven to be a powerful tool to obtain 3D fits ""in-the-wild"". However, depending on the level of detail, it can be hard to impossible to acquire labeled data for training 2D estimators on large scale. We propose a hybrid approach to this problem: with an extended version of the recently introduced SMPLify method, we obtain high quality 3D body model fits for multiple human pose datasets. Human annotators solely sort good and bad fits. This procedure leads to an initial dataset, UP-3D, with rich annotations. With a comprehensive set of experiments, we show how this data can be used to train discriminative models that produce results with an unprecedented level of detail: our models predict 31 segments and 91 landmark locations on the body. Using the 91 landmark pose estimator, we present state-of-the art results for 3D human pose and shape estimation using an order of magnitude less training data and without assumptions about gender or pose in the fitting procedure. We show that UP-3D can be enhanced with these improved fits to grow in quantity and quality, which makes the system deployable on large scale. The data, code and models are available for research purposes."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Lassner_Unite_the_People_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Christoph Lassner, Javier Romero, Martin Kiefel, Federica Bogo, Michael J.

Universal Adversarial Perturbations	Given a state-of-the-art deep neural network classifier, we show the existence of a universal (image-agnostic) and very small perturbation vector that causes natural images to be misclassified with high probability. We propose a systematic algorithm for computing universal perturbations, and show that state-of-the-art deep neural networks are highly vulnerable to such perturbations, albeit being quasi-imperceptible to the human eye. We further empirically analyze these universal perturbations and show, in particular, that they generalize very well across neural networks. The surprising existence of universal perturbations reveals important geometric correlations among the high-dimensional decision boundary of classifiers. It further outlines potential security breaches with the existence of single directions in the input space that adversaries can possibly exploit to break a classifier on most natural images.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Moosavi-Dezfooli_Universal_Adversarial_Perturbations_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Seyed-Mohsen Moosavi-Dezfooli, Alhussein Fawzi, Omar Fawzi, Pascal Frossard
Unrolling the Shutter: CNN to Correct Motion Distortions	Row-wise exposure delay present in CMOS cameras is responsible for skew and curvature distortions known as the rolling shutter (RS) effect while imaging under camera motion. Existing RS correction methods resort to using multiple images or tailor scene-specific correction schemes. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that automatically learns essential scene features from a single RS image to estimate the row-wise camera motion and undo RS distortions back to the time of first-row exposure. We employ long rectangular kernels to specifically learn the effects produced by the row-wise exposure. Experiments reveal that our proposed architecture performs better than the conventional CNN employing square kernels. Our single-image correction method fares well even operating in a frame-by-frame manner against video-based methods and performs better than scene-specific correction schemes even under challenging situations.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Rengarajan_Unrolling_the_Shutter_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Vijay Rengarajan, Yogesh Balaji, A.

Unsupervised Adaptive Re-Identification in Open World Dynamic Camera Networks	Person re-identification is an open and challenging problem in computer vision. Existing approaches have concentrated on either designing the best feature representation or learning optimal matching metrics in a static setting where the number of cameras are fixed in a network. Most approaches have neglected the dynamic and open world nature of the re-identification problem, where a new camera may be temporarily inserted into an existing system to get additional information. To address such a novel and very practical problem, we propose an unsupervised adaptation scheme for re-identification models in a dynamic camera network. First, we formulate a domain perceptive re-identification method based on geodesic flow kernel that can effectively find the best source camera (already installed) to adapt with a newly introduced target camera, without requiring a very expensive training phase. Second, we introduce a transitive inference algorithm for re-identification that can exploit the information from best source camera to improve the accuracy across other camera pairs in a network of multiple cameras. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning based alternatives whilst being extremely efficient to compute.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Panda_Unsupervised_Adaptive_Re-Identification_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Rameswar Panda, Amran Bhuiyan, Vittorio Murino, Amit K.

Unsupervised Human Action Detection by Action Matching	We propose a new task of unsupervised action detection by action matching. Given two long videos, the objective is to temporally detect all pairs of matching video segments. A pair of video segments are matched if they share the same human action. The task is category independent---it does not matter what action is being performed---and no supervision is used to discover such video segments. Unsupervised action detection by action matching allows us to align videos in a meaningful manner. As such, it can be used to discover new action categories or as an action proposal technique within, say, an action detection pipeline. We solve this new task using an effective and efficient method. We use an unsupervised temporal encoding method and exploit the temporal consistency in human actions to obtain candidate action segments. We evaluate our method on this challenging task using three activity recognition benchmarks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w20/html/Fernando_Unsupervised_Human_Action_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Basura Fernando, Sareh Shirazi, Stephen Gould
Unsupervised Learning of Depth and Ego-Motion From Video	We present an unsupervised learning framework for the task of dense 3D geometry and camera motion estimation from unstructured video sequences. In common with recent work, we use an end-to-end learning approach with view synthesis as the supervisory signal. In contrast to these works, our method is completely unsupervised, requiring only a sequence of images as input. We achieve this with a network that estimates the 6-DoF camera pose parameters of the input set, along with dense depth for a reference view using single-view inference. Our loss is constructed by projecting the nearby posed views into the reference view via the depth map. Results using the KITTI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which performs on par with another deep learning approach that assumes ground-truth pose information at training time.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhou_Unsupervised_Learning_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Tinghui Zhou, Matthew Brown, Noah Snavely, David G.

Unsupervised Learning of Long-Term Motion Dynamics for Videos	We present an unsupervised representation learning approach that compactly encodes the motion dependencies in videos. Given a pair of images from a video clip, our framework learns to predict the long-term 3D motions. To reduce the complexity of the learning framework, we propose to describe the motion as a sequence of atomic 3D flows computed with RGB-D modality. We use a Recurrent Neural Network based Encoder-Decoder framework to predict these sequences of flows. We argue that in order for the decoder to reconstruct these sequences, the encoder must learn a robust video representation that captures long-term motion dependencies and spatial-temporal relations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned temporal representations on activity classification across multiple modalities and datasets such as NTU RGB+D and MSR Daily Activity 3D. Our framework is generic to any input modality, i.e., RGB, depth, and RGB-D videos.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Luo_Unsupervised_Learning_of_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zelun Luo, Boya Peng, De-An Huang, Alexandre Alahi, Li Fei-Fei
Unsupervised Monocular Depth Estimation With Left-Right Consistency	Learning based methods have shown very promising results for the task of depth estimation in single images. However, most existing approaches treat depth prediction as a supervised regression problem and as a result, require vast quantities of corresponding ground truth depth data for training. Just recording quality depth data in a range of environments is a challenging problem. In this paper, we innovate beyond existing approaches, replacing the use of explicit depth data during training with easier-to-obtain binocular stereo footage. We propose a novel training objective that enables our convo- lutional neural network to learn to perform single image depth estimation, despite the absence of ground truth depth data. Ex- ploiting epipolar geometry constraints, we generate disparity images by training our network with an image reconstruction loss. We show that solving for image reconstruction alone re- sults in poor quality depth images. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel training loss that enforces consistency be- tween the disparities produced relative to both the left and right images, leading to improved performance and robustness com- pared to existing approaches. Our method produces state of the art results for monocular depth estimation on the KITTI driving dataset, even outperforming supervised methods that have been trained with ground truth depth.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Godard_Unsupervised_Monocular_Depth_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Clement Godard, Oisin Mac Aodha, Gabriel J.

Unsupervised Part Learning for Visual Recognition	Part-based image classification aims at representing categories by small sets of learned discriminative parts, upon which an image representation is built. Considered as a promising avenue a decade ago, this direction has been neglected since the advent of deep neural networks. In this context, this paper brings two contributions: first, this work proceeds one step further compared to recent part-based models (PBM), focusing on how to learn parts without using any labeled data. Instead of learning a set of parts per class, as generally performed in the PBM literature, the proposed approach both constructs a partition of a given set of images into visually similar groups, and subsequently learns a set of discriminative parts per group in a fully unsupervised fashion. This strategy opens the door to the use of PBM in new applications where labeled data are typically not available, such as instance-based image retrieval. Second, this paper shows that despite the recent success of end-to-end models, explicit part learning can still boost classification performance. We experimentally show that our learned parts can help building efficient image representations, which outperform state-of-the art Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) on both classification and retrieval tasks.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Sicre_Unsupervised_Part_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ronan Sicre, Yannis Avrithis, Ewa Kijak, Frederic Jurie
Unsupervised Pixel-Level Domain Adaptation With Generative Adversarial Networks	Collecting well-annotated image datasets to train modern machine learning algorithms is prohibitively expensive for many tasks. One appealing alternative is rendering synthetic data where ground-truth annotations are generated automatically. Unfortunately, models trained purely on rendered images fail to generalize to real images. To address this shortcoming, prior work introduced unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms that have tried to either map representations between the two domains, or learn to extract features that are domain-invariant. In this work, we approach the problem in a new light by learning in an unsupervised manner a transformation in the pixel space from one domain to the other. Our generative adversarial network (GAN)-based method adapts source-domain images to appear as if drawn from the target domain. Our approach not only produces plausible samples, but also outperforms the state-of-the-art on a number of unsupervised domain adaptation scenarios by large margins. Finally, we demonstrate that the adaptation process generalizes to object classes unseen during training.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Bousmalis_Unsupervised_Pixel-Level_Domain_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Konstantinos Bousmalis, Nathan Silberman, David Dohan, Dumitru Erhan, Dilip Krishnan
Unsupervised Semantic Scene Labeling for Streaming Data	We introduce an unsupervised semantic scene labeling approach that continuously learns and adapts semantic models discovered within a data stream. While closely related to unsupervised video segmentation, our algorithm is not designed to be an early video processing strategy that produces coherent over-segmentations, but instead, to directly learn higher-level semantic concepts. This is achieved with an ensemble-based approach, where each learner clusters data from a local window in the data stream. Overlapping local windows are processed and encoded in a graph structure to create a label mapping across windows and reconcile the labelings to reduce unsupervised learning noise. Additionally, we iteratively learn a merging threshold criteria from observed data similarities to automatically determine the number of learned labels without human provided parameters. Experiments show that our approach semantically labels video streams with a high degree of accuracy, and achieves a better balance of under and over-segmentation entropy than existing video segmentation algorithms given similar numbers of label outputs.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wigness_Unsupervised_Semantic_Scene_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Maggie Wigness, John G.

Unsupervised Vanishing Point Detection and Camera Calibration From a Single Manhattan Image With Radial Distortion	The article concerns the automatic calibration of a camera with radial distortion from a single image. It is known that, under the mild assumption of square pixels and zero skew, lines in the scene project into circles in the image, and three lines suffice to calibrate the camera up to an ambiguity between focal length and radial distortion. The calibration results highly depend on accurate circle estimation, which is hard to accomplish because lines tend to project into short circular arcs. To overcome this problem, we show that, given a short circular arc edge, it is possible to robustly determine a line that goes through the center of the corresponding circle. These lines, henceforth called Lines of Circle Centres (LCCs), are used in a new method that detects sets of parallel lines and estimates the calibration parameters, including the center and amount of distortion, focal length, and camera orientation with respect to the Manhattan frame. Extensive experiments in both semi-synthetic and real images show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in unsupervised calibration from a single image, while providing more information.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Antunes_Unsupervised_Vanishing_Point_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Michel Antunes, Joao P.

Unsupervised Video Summarization With Adversarial LSTM Networks	This paper addresses the problem of unsupervised video summarization, formulated as selecting a sparse subset of video frames that optimally represent the input video. Our key idea is to learn a deep summarizer network to minimize distance between training videos and a distribution of their summarizations, in an unsupervised way. Such a summarizer can then be applied on a new video for estimating its optimal summarization. For learning, we specify a novel generative adversarial framework, consisting of the summarizer and discriminator. The summarizer is the autoencoder long short-term memory network (LSTM) aimed at, first, selecting video frames, and then decoding the obtained summarization for reconstructing the input video. The discriminator is another LSTM aimed at distinguishing between the original video and its reconstruction from the summarizer. The summarizer LSTM is cast as an adversary of the discriminator, i.e., trained so as to maximally confuse the discriminator. This learning is also regularized for sparsity. Evaluation on four benchmark datasets, consisting of videos showing diverse events in first- and third-person views, demonstrates our competitive performance in comparison to fully supervised state-of-the-art approaches.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Mahasseni_Unsupervised_Video_Summarization_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Behrooz Mahasseni, Michael Lam, Sinisa Todorovic
Unsupervised Visual-Linguistic Reference Resolution in Instructional Videos	"We propose an unsupervised method for reference resolution in instructional videos, where the goal is to temporally link an entity (e.g., ""dressing"") to the action (e.g., ""mix yogurt"") that produced it. The key challenge is the inevitable visual-linguistic ambiguities arising from the changes in both visual appearance and referring expression of an entity in the video. This challenge is amplified by the fact that we aim to resolve references with no supervision. We address these challenges by learning a joint visual-linguistic model, where linguistic cues can help resolve visual ambiguities and vice versa. We verify our approach by learning our model unsupervisedly using more than two thousand unstructured cooking videos from YouTube, and show that our visual-linguistic model can substantially improve upon state-of-the-art linguistic only model on reference resolution in instructional videos."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Huang_Unsupervised_Visual-Linguistic_Reference_CVPR_2017_paper.html	De-An Huang, Joseph J.

UntrimmedNets for Weakly Supervised Action Recognition and Detection	Current action recognition methods heavily rely on trimmed videos for model training. However, it is expensive and time-consuming to acquire a large-scale trimmed video dataset. This paper presents a new weakly supervised architecture, called UntrimmedNet, which is able to directly learn action recognition models from untrimmed videos without the requirement of temporal annotations of action instances. Our UntrimmedNet couples two important components, the classification module and the selection module, to learn the action models and reason about the temporal duration of action instances, respectively. These two components are implemented with feed-forward networks, and UntrimmedNet is therefore an end-to-end trainable architecture. We exploit the learned models for action recognition (WSR) and detection (WSD) on the untrimmed video datasets of THUMOS14 and ActivityNet. Although our UntrimmedNet only employs weak supervision, our method achieves performance superior or comparable to that of those strongly supervised approaches on these two datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Wang_UntrimmedNets_for_Weakly_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Limin Wang, Yuanjun Xiong, Dahua Lin, Luc Van Gool
Using Locally Corresponding CAD Models for Dense 3D Reconstructions From a Single Image	"We investigate the problem of estimating the dense 3D shape of an object, given a set of 2D landmarks and silhouette in a single image. An obvious prior to employ in such a problem is a dictionary of dense CAD models. Employing a sufficiently large enough dictionary of CAD models, however, is in general computationally infeasible. A common strategy in dictionary learning to encourage generalization is to allow for linear combinations of dictionary elements. This too, however, is problematic as most CAD models cannot be readily placed in global dense correspondence. In this paper, we propose a two-step strategy. First, we employ orthogonal matching pursuit to rapidly choose the ""closest"" single CAD model in our dictionary to the projected image. Second, we employ a novel graph embedding based on local dense correspondence to allow for sparse linear combinations of CAD models. We validate our framework experimentally in both synthetic and real world scenario and demonstrate the superiority of our approach to both 3D mesh reconstruction and volumetric representation."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Kong_Using_Locally_Corresponding_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Chen Kong, Chen-Hsuan Lin, Simon Lucey
Using Ranking-CNN for Age Estimation	Human age is considered an important biometric trait for human identification or search. Recent research shows that the aging features deeply learned from large-scale data lead to significant performance improvement on facial image-based age estimation. However, age-related ordinal information is totally ignored in these approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based framework, ranking-CNN, for age estimation. Ranking-CNN contains a series of basic CNNs, each of which is trained with ordinal age labels. Then, their binary outputs are aggregated for the final age prediction. We theoretically obtain a much tighter error bound for ranking-based age estimation. Moreover, we rigorously prove that ranking-CNN is more likely to get smaller estimation errors when compared with multi-class classification approaches. Through extensive experiments, we show that statistically, ranking-CNN significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art age estimation models on benchmark datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chen_Using_Ranking-CNN_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shixing Chen, Caojin Zhang, Ming Dong, Jialiang Le, Mike Rao
Variational Autoencoded Regression: High Dimensional Regression of Visual Data on Complex Manifold	This paper proposes a new high dimensional regression method by merging Gaussian process regression into a variational autoencoder framework. In contrast to other regression methods, the proposed method focuses on the case where output responses are on a complex high dimensional manifold, such as images. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (i) A new regression method estimating high dimensional image responses, which is not handled by existing regression algorithms, is proposed. (ii) The proposed regression method introduces a strategy to learn the latent space as well as the encoder and decoder so that the result of the regressed response in the latent space coincide with the corresponding response in the data space. (iii) The proposed regression is embedded into a generative model, and the whole procedure is developed by the variational autoencoder framework. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our method through a number of experiments on various visual data regression problems.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yoo_Variational_Autoencoded_Regression_CVPR_2017_paper.html	YoungJoon Yoo, Sangdoo Yun, Hyung Jin Chang, Yiannis Demiris, Jin Young Choi
Variational Bayesian Multiple Instance Learning With Gaussian Processes	Gaussian Processes (GPs) are effective Bayesian predictors. We here show for the first time that instance labels of a GP classifier can be inferred in the multiple instance learning (MIL) setting using variational Bayes. We achieve this via a new construction of the bag likelihood that assumes a large value if the instance predictions obey the MIL constraints and a small value otherwise. This construction lets us derive the update rules for the variational parameters analytically, assuring both scalable learning and fast convergence. We observe this model to improve the state of the art in instance label prediction from bag-level supervision in the 20 Newsgroups benchmark, as well as in Barrett's cancer tumor localization from histopathology tissue microarray images. Furthermore, we introduce a novel pipeline for weakly supervised object detection naturally complemented with our model, which improves the state of the art on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 data sets. Last but not least, the performance of our model can be further boosted up using mixed supervision: a combination of weak (bag) and strong (instance) labels.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Haussmann_Variational_Bayesian_Multiple_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Manuel Haussmann, Fred A.

Vehicle Type Classification Using Bagging and Convolutional Neural Network on Multi View Surveillance Image	This paper aims to introduce a new vehicle type classification scheme on the images from multi-view surveillance camera. We propose four concepts to increase the performance on the images which have various resolutions from multi-view point. The Deep Learning method is essential to multi-view point image, bagging method makes system robust, data augmentation help to grow the classification capability, and post-processing compensate for imbalanced data. We combine these schemes and build a novel vehicle type classification system. Our system shows 97.84% classification accuracy on the 103,833 images in classification challenge dataset.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w9/html/Kim_Vehicle_Type_Classification_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Pyong-Kun Kim, Kil-Taek Lim
ViP-CNN: Visual Phrase Guided Convolutional Neural Network	As the intermediate level task connecting image captioning and object detection, visual relationship detection started to catch researchers' attention because of its descriptive power and clear structure. It detects the objects and captures their pair-wise interactions with a subject-predicate-object triplet, e.g. person-ride-horse. In this paper, each visual relationship is considered as a phrase with three components. We formulate the visual relationship detection as three inter-connected recognition problems and propose a Visual Phrase guided Convolutional Neural Network (ViP-CNN) to address them simultaneously. In ViP-CNN, we present a Phrase-guided Message Passing Structure (PMPS) to establish the connection among relationship components and help the model consider the three problems jointly. Corresponding non-maximum suppression method and model training strategy are also proposed. Experimental results show that our ViP-CNN outperforms the state-of-art method both in speed and accuracy. We further pretrain ViP-CNN on our cleansed Visual Genome Relationship dataset, which is found to perform better than the pretraining on the ImageNet for this task.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Li_ViP-CNN_Visual_Phrase_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yikang Li, Wanli Ouyang, Xiaogang Wang, Xiao'ou Tang
VidLoc: A Deep Spatio-Temporal Model for 6-DoF Video-Clip Relocalization	Machine learning techniques, namely convolutional neural networks (CNN) and regression forests, have recently shown great promise in performing 6-DoF localization of monocular images. However, in most cases image-sequences, rather only single images, are readily available. To this extent, none of the proposed learning-based approaches exploit the valuable constraint of temporal smoothness, often leading to situations where the per-frame error is larger than the camera motion. In this paper we propose a recurrent model for performing 6-DoF localization of video-clips. We find that, even by considering only short sequences (20 frames), the pose estimates are smoothed and the localization error can be drastically reduced. Finally, we consider means of obtaining probabilistic pose estimates from our model. We evaluate our method on openly-available real-world autonomous driving and indoor localization datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Clark_VidLoc_A_Deep_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ronald Clark, Sen Wang, Andrew Markham, Niki Trigoni, Hongkai Wen
Video Acceleration Magnification	The ability to amplify or reduce subtle image changes over time is useful in contexts such as video editing, medical video analysis, product quality control and sports. In these contexts there is often large motion present which severely distorts current video amplification methods that magnify change linearly. In this work we propose a method to cope with large motions while still magnifying small changes. We make the following two observations: i) large motions are linear on the temporal scale of the small changes; ii) small changes deviate from this linearity. We ignore linear motion and propose to magnify acceleration. Our method is pure Eulerian and does not require any optical flow, temporal alignment or region annotations. We link temporal second-order derivative filtering to spatial acceleration magnification. We apply our method to moving objects where we show motion magnification and color magnification. We provide quantitative as well as qualitative evidence for our method while comparing to the state-of-the-art.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Video_Acceleration_Magnification_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yichao Zhang, Silvia L.

Video Action Recognition Based on Deeper Convolution Networks With Pair-Wise Frame Motion Concatenation	Deep convolution networks have shown a remarkable performance in different recognition tasks. Howerver, in reality, recognition is hard especially for the videos. Challenges such as cluttered backgrounds etc. generate the problem like large inter and intra class variations. In addition, the problem of data deficiency could also make the designed model degrade during learning and update. To overcome those limitations, in this work, we proposed a deeper convolution networks based approach with pair-wise motion concatenation, which is named deep temporal convolutional networks. A temporal motion accumulation mechanism has been introduced as an effective data entry for learning of convolution networks. To handle the possible data deficiency, beneficial practices of transferring ResNet-101 weights and data variation augmentation are utilized for robust recognition. Experiments on UCF101 and ODAR dataset have verified a preferable performance when compared with state-of-art works.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w14/html/Han_Video_Action_Recognition_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yamin Han, Peng Zhang, Tao Zhuo, Wei Huang, Yanning Zhang
Video Captioning With Transferred Semantic Attributes	Automatically generating natural language descriptions of videos plays a fundamental challenge for computer vision community. Most recent progress in this problem has been achieved through employing 2-D and/or 3-D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to encode video content and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to decode a sentence. In this paper, we present Long Short-Term Memory with Transferred Semantic Attributes (LSTM-TSA)---a novel deep architecture that incorporates the transferred semantic attributes learnt from images and videos into the CNN plus RNN framework, by training them in an end-to-end manner. The design of LSTM-TSA is highly inspired by the facts that 1) semantic attributes play a significant contribution to captioning, and 2) images and videos carry complementary semantics and thus can reinforce each other for captioning. To boost video captioning, we propose a novel transfer unit to model the mutually correlated attributes learnt from images and videos. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets, i.e., MSVD, M-VAD and MPII-MD. Our proposed LSTM-TSA achieves to-date the best published performance in sentence generation on MSVD: 52.8% and 74.0% in terms of BLEU@4 and CIDEr-D. Superior results are also reported on M-VAD and MPII-MD when compared to state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Pan_Video_Captioning_With_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yingwei Pan, Ting Yao, Houqiang Li, Tao Mei
Video Desnowing and Deraining Based on Matrix Decomposition	The existing snow/rain removal methods often fail for heavy snow/rain and dynamic scene. One reason for the failure is due to the assumption that all the snowflakes/rain streaks are sparse in snow/rain scenes. The other is that the existing methods often can not differentiate moving objects and snowflakes/rain streaks. In this paper, we propose a model based on matrix decomposition for video desnowing and deraining to solve the problems mentioned above. We divide snowflakes/rain streaks into two categories: sparse ones and dense ones. With background fluctuations and optical flow information, the detection of moving objects and sparse snowflakes/rain streaks is formulated as a multi-label Markov Random Fields (MRFs). As for dense snowflakes/rain streaks, they are considered to obey Gaussian distribution. The snowflakes/rain streaks, including sparse ones and dense ones, in scene backgrounds are removed by low-rank representation of the backgrounds. Meanwhile, a group sparsity term in our model is designed to filter snow/rain pixels within the moving objects. Experimental results show that our proposed model performs better than the state-of-the-art methods for snow and rain removal.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ren_Video_Desnowing_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Weihong Ren, Jiandong Tian, Zhi Han, Antoni Chan, Yandong Tang
Video Frame Interpolation via Adaptive Convolution	Video frame interpolation typically involves two steps: motion estimation and pixel synthesis. Such a two-step approach heavily depends on the quality of motion estimation. This paper presents a robust video frame interpolation method that combines these two steps into a single process. Specifically, our method considers pixel synthesis for the interpolated frame as local convolution over two input frames. The convolution kernel captures both the local motion between the input frames and the coefficients for pixel synthesis. Our method employs a deep fully convolutional neural network to estimate a spatially-adaptive convolution kernel for each pixel. This deep neural network can be directly trained end to end using widely available video data without any difficult-to-obtain ground-truth data like optical flow. Our experiments show that the formulation of video interpolation as a single convolution process allows our method to gracefully handle challenges like occlusion, blur, and abrupt brightness change and enables high-quality video frame interpolation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Niklaus_Video_Frame_Interpolation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Simon Niklaus, Long Mai, Feng Liu
Video Propagation Networks	"We propose a technique that propagates information forward through video data. The method is conceptually simple and can be applied to tasks that require the propagation of structured information, such as semantic labels, based on video content. We propose a ""Video Propagation Network"" that processes video frames in an adaptive manner. The model is applied online: it propagates information forward without the need to access future frames. In particular we combine two components, a temporal bilateral network for dense and video adaptive filtering, followed by a spatial network to refine features and increased flexibility. We present experiments on video object segmentation and semantic video segmentation and show increased performance comparing to the best previous task-specific methods, while having favorable runtime. Additionally we demonstrate our approach on an example regression task of color propagation in a grayscale video."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Jampani_Video_Propagation_Networks_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Varun Jampani, Raghudeep Gadde, Peter V.

Video Segmentation via Multiple Granularity Analysis	We introduce a Multiple Granularity Analysis framework for video segmentation in a coarse-to-fine manner. We cast video segmentation as a spatio-temporal superpixel labeling problem. Benefited from the bounding volume provided by off-the-shelf object trackers, we estimate the foreground/ background super-pixel labeling using the spatiotemporal multiple instance learning algorithm to obtain coarse foreground/background separation within the volume. We further refine the segmentation mask in the pixel level using the graph-cut model. Extensive experiments on benchmark video datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed video segmentation algorithm.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yang_Video_Segmentation_via_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Rui Yang, Bingbing Ni, Chao Ma, Yi Xu, Xiaokang Yang
Video-Based Person Re-Identification by Deep Feature Guided Pooling	Person re-identification (re-id) aims to match a specific person across non-overlapping views of different cameras, which is currently one of the hot topics in computer vision. Compared with image-based person re-id, video-based techniques could achieve better performance by fully utilizing the space-time information. This paper presents a novel video-based person re-id method named Deep Feature Guided Pooling (DFGP), which can take full advantage of the space-time information. The contributions of the method are in the following aspects: (1) PCA-based convolutional network (PCN), a lightweight deep learning network, is trained to generate deep features of video frames. Deep features are aggregated by average pooling to obtain person deep feature vectors. The vectors are utilized to guide the generation of human appearance features, which makes the appearance features robust to the severe noise in videos. (2) Hand-crafted local features of videos are aggregated by max pooling to reinforce the motion variations of different persons. In this way, the human descriptors are more discriminative. (3) The final human descriptors are composed of deep features and hand-crafted local features to take their own advantages and the performance of identification is promoted. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms six other state-of-the-art video-based methods on the challenging PRID 2011 and iLIDS-VID video-based person re-id datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w17/html/Li_Video-Based_Person_Re-Identification_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Youjiao Li, Li Zhuo, Jiafeng Li, Jing Zhang, Xi Liang, Qi Tian
Video2Shop: Exact Matching Clothes in Videos to Online Shopping Images	In recent years, both online retail and video hosting service have been exponentially grown. In this paper, a novel deep neural network, called AsymNet, is proposed to explore a new cross-domain task, Video2Shop, targeting for matching clothes appeared in videos to the exactly same items in online shops. For the image side, well-established methods are used to detect and extract features for clothing patches with arbitrary sizes. For the video side, deep visual features are extracted from detected object regions in each frame, and further fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) framework for sequence modeling, which captures the temporal dynamics in videos. To conduct exact matching between videos and online shopping images, LSTM hidden states for videos and image features extracted from static images are jointly modeled, under the similarity network with reconfigurable deep tree structure. Moreover, an approximate training method is proposed to achieve the efficiency when training. Extensive experiments conducted on a large cross-domain dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed AsymNet, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Cheng_Video2Shop_Exact_Matching_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhi-Qi Cheng, Xiao Wu, Yang Liu, Xian-Sheng Hua
Viraliency: Pooling Local Virality	In our overly-connected world, the automatic recognition of virality -- the quality of an image or video to be rapidly and widely spread -- is of crucial importance, and has recently awaken the interest of the computer vision community Concurrently, recent progress in deep learning architectures showed that global (average) pooling strategies allow to extract class activation maps, which highlight the part of the image most likely to contain a certain class. We extend this concept by introducing a pooling layer that learns the size of the average support: the learned top-N average (LENA) pooling. We hypothesize that the latent concepts (feature maps) describing virality may require such a rich pooling strategy and perform an extensive evaluation to assess the validity of this hypothesis. Moreover, we also appraise the use of objectness maps at predicting and localizing the virality of an image. Experiments are shown in two publicly available datasets annotated for virality.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Alameda-Pineda_Viraliency_Pooling_Local_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xavier Alameda-Pineda, Andrea Pilzer, Dan Xu, Nicu Sebe, Elisa Ricci
Visual Dialog	We introduce the task of Visual Dialog, which requires an AI agent to hold a meaningful dialog with humans in natural, conversational language about visual content. Specifically, given an image, a dialog history, and a question about the image, the agent has to ground the question in image, infer context from history, and answer the question accurately. Visual Dialog is disentangled enough from a specific downstream task so as to serve as a general test of machine intelligence, while being grounded in vision enough to allow objective evaluation of individual responses and benchmark progress. We develop a novel two-person chat data-collection protocol to curate a large-scale Visual Dialog dataset (VisDial). VisDial contains 1 dialog (10 question- answer pairs) on 140k images from the COCO dataset, with a total of 1.4M dialog question-answer pairs. We introduce a family of neural encoder-decoder models for Visual Dialog with 3 encoders (Late Fusion, Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder and Memory Network) and 2 decoders (generative and discriminative), which outperform a number of sophisticated baselines. We propose a retrieval-based evaluation protocol for Visual Dialog where the AI agent is asked to sort a set of candidate answers and evaluated on metrics such as mean-reciprocal-rank of human response. We quantify gap between machine and human performance on the Visual Dialog task via human studies. Our dataset, code, and trained models will be released publicly at https://visualdialog.org.

Visual Translation Embedding Network for Visual Relation Detection	"Visual relations, such as ""person ride bike"" and ""bike next to car"", offer a comprehensive scene understanding of an image, and have already shown their great utility in connecting computer vision and natural language. However, due to the challenging combinatorial complexity of modeling subject-predicate-object relation triplets, very little work has been done to localize and predict visual relations. Inspired by the recent advances in relational representation learning of knowledge bases and convolutional object detection networks, we propose a Visual Translation Embedding network (VTransE) for visual relation detection. VTransE places objects in a low-dimensional relation space where a relation can be modeled as a simple vector translation, i.e., subject + predicate = object. We propose a novel feature extraction layer that enables object-relation knowledge transfer in a fully-convolutional fashion that supports training and inference in a single forward/backward pass. To the best of our knowledge, VTransE is the first end-to-end relation detection network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VTransE over other state-of-the-art methods on two large-scale datasets: Visual Relationship and Visual Genome. Note that even though VTransE is a purely visual model, it is still competitive to the Lu's multi-modal model with language"	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhang_Visual_Translation_Embedding_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Hanwang Zhang, Zawlin Kyaw, Shih-Fu Chang, Tat-Seng Chua
Visual-Inertial-Semantic Scene Representation for 3D Object Detection	We describe a system to detect objects in three-dimensional space using video and inertial sensors (accelerometer and gyrometer), ubiquitous in modern mobile platforms from phones to drones. Inertials afford the ability to impose class-specific scale priors for objects, and provide a global orientation reference. A minimal sufficient representation, the posterior of semantic (identity) and syntactic (pose) attributes of objects in space, can be decomposed into a geometric term, which can be maintained by a localization-and-mapping filter, and a likelihood function, which can be approximated by a discriminatively-trained convolutional neural network The resulting system can process the video stream causally in real time, and provides a representation of objects in the scene that is persistent: Confidence in the presence of objects grows with evidence, and objects previously seen are kept in memory even when temporarily occluded, with their return into view automatically predicted to prime re-detection.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Dong_Visual-Inertial-Semantic_Scene_Representation_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jingming Dong, Xiaohan Fei, Stefano Soatto
WILDCAT: Weakly Supervised Learning of Deep ConvNets for Image Classification, Pointwise Localization and Segmentation	This paper introduces WILDCAT, a deep learning method which jointly aims at aligning image regions for gaining spatial invariance and learning strongly localized features. Our model is trained using only global image labels and is devoted to three main visual recognition tasks: image classification, weakly supervised object localization and semantic segmentation. WILDCAT extends state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks at three main levels: the use of Fully Convolutional Networks for maintaining spatial resolution, the explicit design in the network of local features related to different class modalities, and a new way to pool these features to provide a global image prediction required for weakly supervised training.

WSISA: Making Survival Prediction From Whole Slide Histopathological Images	Image-based precision medicine techniques can be used to better treat cancer patients. However, the gigapixel resolution of Whole Slide Histopathological Images (WSIs) makes traditional survival models computationally impossible. These models usually adopt manually labeled discriminative patches from region of interests (ROIs) and are unable to directly learn discriminative patches from WSIs. We argue that only a small set of patches cannot fully represent the patients' survival status due to the heterogeneity of tumor. Another challenge is that survival prediction usually comes with insufficient training patient samples. In this paper, we propose an effective Whole Slide Histopathological Images Survival Analysis framework (WSISA) to overcome above challenges. To exploit survival-discriminative patterns from WSIs, we first extract hundreds of patches from each WSI by adaptive sampling and then group these images into different clusters. Then we propose to train an aggregation model to make patient-level predictions based on cluster-level Deep Convolutional Survival (DeepConvSurv) prediction results. Different from existing state-of-the-arts image-based survival models which extract features using some patches from small regions of WSIs, the proposed framework can efficiently exploit and utilize all discriminative patterns in WSIs to predict patients' survival status. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been shown before. We apply our method to the survival predictions of glioma and non-small-cell lung cancer using three datasets. Results demonstrate the proposed framework can significantly improve the prediction performance compared with the existing state-of-the-arts survival methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Zhu_WSISA_Making_Survival_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Xinliang Zhu, Jiawen Yao, Feiyun Zhu, Junzhou Huang
Weakly Supervised Action Learning With RNN Based Fine-To-Coarse Modeling	We present an approach for weakly supervised learning of human actions. Given a set of videos and an ordered list of the occurring actions, the goal is to infer start and end frames of the related action classes within the video and to train the respective action classifiers without any need for hand labeled frame boundaries. To address this task, we propose a combination of a discriminative representation of subactions, modeled by a recurrent neural network, and a coarse probabilistic model to allow for a temporal alignment and inference over long sequences. While this system alone already generates good results, we show that the performance can be further improved by approximating the number of subactions to the characteristics of the different action classes. To this end, we adapt the number of subaction classes by iterating realignment and reestimation during training. The proposed system is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, the Breakfast and the Hollywood extended dataset, showing a competitive performance on various weak learning tasks such as temporal action segmentation and action alignment.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Richard_Weakly_Supervised_Action_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Alexander Richard, Hilde Kuehne, Juergen Gall
Weakly Supervised Actor-Action Segmentation via Robust Multi-Task Ranking	Fine-grained activity understanding in videos has attracted considerable recent attention with a shift from action classification to detailed actor and action understanding that provides compelling results for perceptual needs of cutting-edge autonomous systems. However, current methods for detailed understanding of actor and action have significant limitations: they require large amounts of finely labeled data, and they fail to capture any internal relationship among actors and actions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel, robust multi-task ranking model for weakly supervised actor-action segmentation where only video-level tags are given for training samples. Our model is able to share useful information among different actors and actions while learning a ranking matrix to select representative supervoxels for actors and actions respectively. Final segmentation results are generated by a conditional random field that considers various ranking scores for different video parts. Extensive experimental results on the Actor-Action Dataset (A2D) demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods and performs as well as the top-performing fully supervised method.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Yan_Weakly_Supervised_Actor-Action_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yan Yan, Chenliang Xu, Dawen Cai, Jason J.

Weakly Supervised Affordance Detection	Localizing functional regions of objects or affordances is an important aspect of scene understanding and relevant for many robotics applications. In this work, we introduce a pixel-wise annotated affordance dataset of 3090 images containing 9916 object instances. Since parts of an object can have multiple affordances, we address this by a convo- lutional neural network for multilabel affordance segmen- tation. We also propose an approach to train the network from very few keypoint annotations. Our approach achieves a higher affordance detection accuracy than other weakly supervised methods that also rely on keypoint annotations or image annotations as weak supervision.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Sawatzky_Weakly_Supervised_Affordance_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Johann Sawatzky, Abhilash Srikantha, Juergen Gall
Weakly Supervised Cascaded Convolutional Networks	Object detection is a challenging task in visual understanding domain, and even more so if the supervision is to be weak. Recently, few efforts to handle the task without expensive human annotations is established by promising deep neural network. A new architecture of cascaded networks is proposed to learn a convolutional neural network (CNN) under such conditions. We introduce two such architectures, with either two cascade stages or three which are trained in an end-to-end pipeline. The first stage of both architectures extracts best candidate of class specific region proposals by training a fully convolutional network. In the case of the three stage architecture, the middle stage provides object segmentation, using the output of the activation maps of first stage. The final stage of both architectures is a part of a convolutional neural network that performs multiple instance learning on proposals extracted in the previous stage(s). Our experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2007, 2010, 2012 and large scale object datasets, ILSVRC 2013, 2014 datasets show improvements in the areas of weakly-supervised object detection, classification and localization.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Diba_Weakly_Supervised_Cascaded_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Ali Diba, Vivek Sharma, Ali Pazandeh, Hamed Pirsiavash, Luc Van Gool
Weakly Supervised Dense Video Captioning	This paper focuses on a novel and challenging vision task, dense video captioning, which aims to automatically describe a video clip with multiple informative and diverse caption sentences. The proposed method is trained without explicit annotation of fine-grained sentence to video region-sequence correspondence, but is only based on weak video-level sentence annotations. It differs from existing video captioning systems in three technical aspects. First, we propose lexical fully convolutional neural networks (Lexical-FCN) with weakly supervised multi-instance multi-label learning to weakly link video regions with lexical labels. Second, we introduce a novel submodular maximization scheme to generate multiple informative and diverse region-sequences based on the Lexical-FCN outputs. A winner-takes-all scheme is adopted to weakly associate sentences to region-sequences in the training phase. Third, a sequence-to-sequence learning based language model is trained with the weakly supervised information obtained through the association process. We show that the proposed method can not only produce informative and diverse dense captions, but also outperform state-of-the-art single video captioning methods by a large margin.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Shen_Weakly_Supervised_Dense_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Zhiqiang Shen, Jianguo Li, Zhou Su, Minjun Li, Yurong Chen, Yu-Gang Jiang, Xiangyang Xue
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation Using Web-Crawled Videos	We propose a novel algorithm for weakly supervised semantic segmentation based on image-level class labels only. In weakly supervised setting, it is commonly observed that trained model overly focuses on discriminative parts rather than the entire object area. Our goal is to overcome this limitation with no additional human intervention by retrieving videos relevant to target class labels from web repository, and generating segmentation labels from the retrieved videos to simulate strong supervision for semantic segmentation. During this process, we take advantage of image classification with discriminative localization technique to reject false alarms in retrieved videos and identify relevant spatio-temporal volumes within retrieved videos. Although the entire procedure does not require any additional supervision, the segmentation annotations obtained from videos are sufficiently strong to learn a model for semantic segmentation. The proposed algorithm substantially outperforms existing methods based on the same level of supervision and is even as competitive as the approaches relying on extra annotations.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Hong_Weakly_Supervised_Semantic_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Seunghoon Hong, Donghun Yeo, Suha Kwak, Honglak Lee, Bohyung Han
Weakly-Supervised Visual Grounding of Phrases With Linguistic Structures	We propose a weakly-supervised approach that takes image-sentence pairs as input and learns to visually ground (i.e., localize) arbitrary linguistic phrases, in the form of spatial attention masks. Specifically, the model is trained with images and their associated image-level captions, without any explicit region-to-phrase correspondence annotations. To this end, we introduce an end-to-end model which learns visual groundings of phrases with two types of carefully designed loss functions. In addition to the standard discriminative loss, which enforces that attended image regions and phrases are consistently encoded, we propose a novel structural loss which makes use of the parse tree structures induced by the sentences. In particular, we ensure complementarity among the attention masks that correspond to sibling noun phrases, and compositionality of attention masks among the children and parent phrases, as defined by the sentence parse tree. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on the Microsoft COCO and Visual Genome datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xiao_Weakly-Supervised_Visual_Grounding_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Fanyi Xiao, Leonid Sigal, Yong Jae Lee
Webly Supervised Semantic Segmentation	We propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation algorithm that uses image tags for supervision. We apply the tags in queries to collect three sets of web images, which encode the clean foregrounds, the common back- grounds, and realistic scenes of the classes. We introduce a novel three-stage training pipeline to progressively learn semantic segmentation models. We first train and refine a class-specific shallow neural network to obtain segmentation masks for each class. The shallow neural networks of all classes are then assembled into one deep convolutional neural network for end-to-end training and testing. Experiments show that our method notably outperforms previous state-of-the-art weakly supervised semantic segmentation approaches on the PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation bench- mark. We further apply the class-specific shallow neural networks to object segmentation and obtain excellent results.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Jin_Webly_Supervised_Semantic_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Bin Jin, Maria V.

Weighted-Entropy-Based Quantization for Deep Neural Networks	Quantization is considered as one of the most effective methods to optimize the inference cost of neural network models for their deployment to mobile and embedded systems, which have tight resource constraints. In such approaches, it is critical to provide low-cost quantization under a tight accuracy loss constraint (e.g., 1%). In this paper, we propose a novel method for quantizing weights and activations based on the concept of weighted entropy. Unlike recent work on binary-weight neural networks, our approach is multi-bit quantization, in which weights and activations can be quantized by any number of bits depending on the target accuracy. This facilitates much more flexible exploitation of accuracy-performance trade-off provided by different levels of quantization. Moreover, our scheme provides an automated quantization flow based on conventional training algorithms, which greatly reduces the design-time effort to quantize the network. According to our extensive evaluations based on practical neural network models for image classification (AlexNet, GoogLeNet and ResNet-50/101), object detection (R-FCN with 50-layer ResNet), and language modeling (an LSTM network), our method achieves significant reductions in both the model size and the amount of computation with minimal accuracy loss. Also, compared to existing quantization schemes, ours provides higher accuracy with a similar resource constraint and requires much lower design effort.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Park_Weighted-Entropy-Based_Quantization_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Eunhyeok Park, Junwhan Ahn, Sungjoo Yoo
Wetness and Color From a Single Multispectral Image	Visual recognition of wet surfaces and their degrees of wetness is important for many computer vision applications. It can inform slippery spots on a road to autonomous vehicles, muddy areas of a trail to humanoid robots, and the freshness of groceries to us. In the past, monochromatic appearance change, the fact that surfaces darken when wet, has been modeled to recognize wet surfaces. In this paper, we show that color change, particularly in its spectral behavior, carries rich information about a wet surface. We derive an analytical spectral appearance model of wet surfaces that expresses the characteristic spectral sharpening due to multiple scattering and absorption in the surface. We derive a novel method for estimating key parameters of this spectral appearance model, which enables the recovery of the original surface color and the degree of wetness from a single observation. Applied to a multispectral image, the method estimates the spatial map of wetness together with the dry spectral distribution of the surface. To our knowledge, this work is the first to model and leverage the spectral characteristics of wet surfaces to revert its appearance. We conduct comprehensive experimental validation with a number of wet real surfaces. The results demonstrate the accuracy of our model and the effectiveness of our method for surface wetness and color estimation.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Shimano_Wetness_and_Color_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Mihoko Shimano, Hiroki Okawa, Yuta Asano, Ryoma Bise, Ko Nishino, Imari Sato
What Can Help Pedestrian Detection?	Aggregating extra features has been considered as an effective approach to boost traditional pedestrian detection methods. However, there is still a lack of studies on whether and how CNN-based pedestrian detectors can benefit from these extra features. The first contribution of this paper is exploring this issue by aggregating extra features into CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate the effects of different kinds of extra features quantitatively. Moreover, we propose a novel network architecture, namely HyperLearner, to jointly learn pedestrian detection as well as the given extra feature. By multi-task training, HyperLearner is able to utilize the information of given features and improve detection performance without extra inputs in inference. The experimental results on multiple pedestrian benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed HyperLearner.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Mao_What_Can_Help_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jiayuan Mao, Tete Xiao, Yuning Jiang, Zhimin Cao
What Is and What Is Not a Salient Object? Learning Salient Object Detector by Ensembling Linear Exemplar Regressors	Finding what is and what is not a salient object can be helpful in developing better features and models in salient object detection (SOD). In this paper, we investigate the images that are selected and discarded in constructing a new SOD dataset and find that many similar candidates, complex shape and low objectness are three main attributes of many non-salient objects. Moreover, objects may have diversified attributes that make them salient. As a result, we propose a novel salient object detector by ensembling linear exemplar regressors. We first select reliable foreground and background seeds using the boundary prior and then adopt locally linear embedding (LLE) to conduct manifold-preserving foregroundness propagation. In this manner, a foregroundness map can be generated to roughly pop-out salient objects and suppress non-salient ones with many similar candidates. Moreover, we extract the shape, foregroundness and attention descriptors to characterize the extracted object proposals, and a linear exemplar regressor is trained to encode how to detect salient proposals in a specific image. Finally, various linear exemplar regressors are ensembled to form a single detector that adapts to various scenarios. Extensive experimental results on 5 dataset and the new SOD dataset show that our approach outperforms 9 state-of-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xia_What_Is_and_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Changqun Xia, Jia Li, Xiaowu Chen, Anlin Zheng, Yu Zhang
What Is the Space of Attenuation Coefficients in Underwater Computer Vision?	Underwater image reconstruction methods require the knowledge of wideband attenuation coefficients per color channel. Current estimation methods for these coefficients require specialized hardware or multiple images, and none of them leverage the multitude of existing ocean optical measurements as priors. Here, we aim to constrain the set of physically-feasible wideband attenuation coefficients in the ocean by utilizing water attenuation measured worldwide by oceanographers. We calculate the space of valid wideband effective attenuation coefficients in the 3D RGB domain and find that a bound manifold in 3-space sufficiently represents the variation from the clearest to murkiest waters. We validate our model using in situ experiments in two different optical water bodies, the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. Moreover, we show that contradictory to the common image formation model, the coefficients depend on the imaging range and object reflectance, and quantify the errors resulting from ignoring these dependencies.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Akkaynak_What_Is_the_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Derya Akkaynak, Tali Treibitz, Tom Shlesinger, Yossi Loya, Raz Tamir, David Iluz
What Will I Do Next? The Intention From Motion Experiment	In computer vision, video-based approaches have been widely explored for the early classification and the prediction of actions or activities. However, it remains unclear whether this modality (as compared to 3D kinematics) can still be reliable for the prediction of human intentions, defined as the overarching goal embedded in an action sequence. Since the same action can be performed with different intentions, this problem is more challenging but yet affordable as proved by quantitative cognitive studies which exploit the 3D kinematics acquired through motion capture systems. In this paper, we bridge cognitive and computer vision studies, by demonstrating the effectiveness of video-based approaches for the prediction of human intentions. Precisely, we propose Intention from Motion, a new paradigm where, without using any contextual information, we consider instantaneous grasping motor acts involving a bottle in order to forecast why the bottle itself has been reached (to pass it or to place in a box, or to pour or to drink the liquid inside). We process only the grasping onsets casting intention prediction as a classification framework. Leveraging on our multimodal acquisition (3D motion capture data and 2D optical videos), we compare the most commonly used 3D descriptors from cognitive studies with state-of-the-art video-based techniques. Since the two analyses achieve an equivalent performance, we demonstrate that computer vision tools are effective in capturing the kinematics and facing the cognitive problem of human intention prediction.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w1/html/Zunino_What_Will_I_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Andrea Zunino, Jacopo Cavazza, Atesh Koul, Andrea Cavallo, Cristina Becchio, Vittorio Murino
What's in a Question: Using Visual Questions as a Form of Supervision	"Collecting fully annotated image datasets is challenging and expensive. Many types of weak supervision have been explored: weak manual annotations, web search results, temporal continuity, ambient sound and others. We focus on one particular unexplored mode: visual questions that are asked about images. The key observation that inspires our work is that the question itself provides useful information about the image (even without the answer being available). For instance, the question ""what is the breed of the dog?"" informs the AI that the animal in the scene is a dog and that there is only one dog present. We make three contributions: (1) providing an extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis of the information contained in human visual questions, (2) proposing two simple but surprisingly effective modifications to the standard visual question answering models that allow them to make use of weak supervision in the form of unanswered questions associated with images and (3) demonstrating that a simple data augmentation strategy inspired by our insights results in a 7.1% improvement on the standard VQA benchmark."	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ganju_Whats_in_a_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Siddha Ganju, Olga Russakovsky, Abhinav Gupta
When Kernel Methods Meet Feature Learning: Log-Covariance Network for Action Recognition From Skeletal Data	Human action recognition from skeletal data is a hot research topic and important in many open domain applications of computer vision, thanks to recently introduced 3D sensors. In the literature, naive methods simply transfer off-the-shelf techniques from video to the skeletal representation. However, the current state-of-the-art is contended between to different paradigms: kernel-based methods and feature learning with (recurrent) neural networks. Both approaches show strong performances, yet they exhibit heavy, but complementary, drawbacks. Motivated by this fact, our work aims at combining together the best of the two paradigms, by proposing an approach where a shallow network is fed with a covariance representation. Our intuition is that, as long as the dynamics is effectively modeled, there is no need for the classification network to be deep nor recurrent in order to score favorably. We validate this hypothesis in a broad experimental analysis over 6 publicly available datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w14/html/Cavazza_When_Kernel_Methods_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jacopo Cavazza, Pietro Morerio, Vittorio Murino
Why You Should Forget Luminance Conversion and Do Something Better	One of the most frequently applied low-level operations in computer vision is the conversion of an RGB camera image into its luminance representation. This is also one of the most incorrectly applied operations. Even our most trusted softwares, Matlab and OpenCV, do not perform luminance conversion correctly. In this paper, we examine the main factors that make proper RGB to luminance conversion difficult, in particular: 1) incorrect white-balance, 2) incorrect gamma/tone-curve correction, and 3) incorrect equations. Our analysis shows errors up to 50% for various colors are not uncommon. As a result, we argue that for most computer vision problems there is no need to attempt luminance conversion; instead, there are better alternatives depending on the task.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Nguyen_Why_You_Should_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Rang M.

Xception: Deep Learning With Depthwise Separable Convolutions	We present an interpretation of Inception modules in convolutional neural networks as being an intermediate step in-between regular convolution and the depthwise separable convolution operation (a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution). In this light, a depthwise separable convolution can be understood as an Inception module with a maximally large number of towers. This observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules have been replaced with depthwise separable convolutions. We show that this architecture, dubbed Xception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the ImageNet dataset (which Inception V3 was designed for), and significantly outperforms Inception V3 on a larger image classification dataset comprising 350 million images and 17,000 classes. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as Inception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but rather to a more efficient use of model parameters.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chollet_Xception_Deep_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Francois Chollet
YOLO9000: Better, Faster, Stronger	We introduce YOLO9000, a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect over 9000 object categories. First we propose various improvements to the YOLO detection method, both novel and drawn from prior work. The improved model, YOLOv2, is state-of-the-art on standard detection tasks like PASCAL VOC and COCO. Using a novel, multi-scale training method the same YOLOv2 model can run at varying sizes, offering an easy tradeoff between speed and accuracy. At 67 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 76.8 mAP on VOC 2007. At 40 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 78.6 mAP, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Faster RCNN with ResNet and SSD while still running significantly faster. Finally we propose a method to jointly train on object detection and classification. Using this method we train YOLO9000 simultaneously on the COCO detection dataset and the ImageNet classification dataset. Our joint training allows YOLO9000 to predict detections for object classes that don't have labelled detection data. We validate our approach on the ImageNet detection task. YOLO9000 gets 19.7 mAP on the ImageNet detection validation set despite only having detection data for 44 of the 200 classes. On the 156 classes not in COCO, YOLO9000 gets 16.0 mAP. YOLO9000 predicts detections for more than 9000 different object categories, all in real-time.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Redmon_YOLO9000_Better_Faster_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Joseph Redmon, Ali Farhadi
YouTube-BoundingBoxes: A Large High-Precision Human-Annotated Data Set for Object Detection in Video	We introduce a new large-scale data set of video URLs with densely-sampled object bounding box annotations called YouTube-BoundingBoxes (YT-BB). The data set consists of approximately 380,000 video segments about 19s long, automatically selected to feature objects in natural settings without editing or post-processing, with a recording quality often akin to that of a hand-held cell phone camera. The objects represent a subset of the COCO label set. All video segments were human-annotated with high-precision classification labels and bounding boxes at 1 frame per second. The use of a cascade of increasingly precise human annotations ensures a label accuracy above 95% for every class and tight bounding boxes. Finally, we train and evaluate well-known deep network architectures and report baseline figures for per-frame classification and localization. We also demonstrate how the temporal contiguity of video can potentially be used to improve such inferences. The data set can be found at https://research.google.com/youtube-bb. We hope the availability of such large curated corpus will spur new advances in video object detection and tracking.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Real_YouTube-BoundingBoxes_A_Large_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Esteban Real, Jonathon Shlens, Stefano Mazzocchi, Xin Pan, Vincent Vanhoucke
Zero Shot Learning via Multi-Scale Manifold Regularization	We address zero-shot learning using a new manifold alignment framework based on a localized multi-scale transform on graphs. Our inference approach includes a smoothness criterion for a function mapping nodes on a graph (visual representation) onto a linear space (semantic representation), which we optimize using multi-scale graph wavelets. The robustness of the ensuing scheme allows us to operate with automatically generated semantic annotations, resulting in an algorithm that is entirely free of manual supervision, and yet improves the state-of-the-art as measured on benchmark datasets.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Deutsch_Zero_Shot_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Shay Deutsch, Soheil Kolouri, Kyungnam Kim, Yuri Owechko, Stefano Soatto
Zero-Shot Action Recognition With Error-Correcting Output Codes	Recently, zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR) has emerged with the explosive growth of action categories. In this paper, we explore ZSAR from a novel perspective by adopting the Error-Correcting Output Codes (dubbed ZSECOC). Our ZSECOC equips the conventional ECOC with the additional capability of ZSAR, by addressing the domain shift problem. In particular, we learn discriminative ZSECOC for seen categories from both category-level semantics and intrinsic data structures. This procedure deals with domain shift implicitly by transferring the well-established correlations among seen categories to unseen ones. Moreover, a simple semantic transfer strategy is developed for explicitly transforming the learned embeddings of seen categories to better fit the underlying structure of unseen categories. As a consequence, our ZSECOC inherits the promising characteristics from ECOC as well as overcomes domain shift, making it more discriminative for ZSAR. We systematically evaluate ZSECOC on three realistic action benchmarks, i.e. Olympic Sports, HMDB51 and UCF101. The experimental results clearly show the superiority of ZSECOC over the state-of-the-art methods.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Qin_Zero-Shot_Action_Recognition_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Jie Qin, Li Liu, Ling Shao, Fumin Shen, Bingbing Ni, Jiaxin Chen, Yunhong Wang
Zero-Shot Classification With Discriminative Semantic Representation Learning	Zero-shot learning, a special case of unsupervised domain adaptation where the source and target domains have disjoint label spaces, has become increasingly popular in the computer vision community. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot learning method based on discriminative sparse non-negative matrix factorization. The proposed approach aims to identify a set of common high-level semantic components across the two domains via non-negative sparse matrix factorization, while enforcing the representation vectors of the images in this common component-based space to be discriminatively aligned with the attribute-based label representation vectors. To fully exploit the aligned semantic information contained in the learned representation vectors of the instances, we develop a label propagation based testing procedure to classify the unlabeled instances from the unseen classes in the target domain. We conduct experiments on four standard zero-shot learning image datasets, by comparing the proposed approach to the state-of-the-art zero-shot learning methods. The empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Ye_Zero-Shot_Classification_With_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Meng Ye, Yuhong Guo
Zero-Shot Learning - the Good, the Bad and the Ugly	Due to the importance of zero-shot learning, the number of proposed approaches has increased steadily recently. We argue that it is time to take a step back and to analyze the status quo of the area. The purpose of this paper is three-fold. First, given the fact that there is no agreed upon zero-shot learning benchmark, we first define a new benchmark by unifying both the evaluation protocols and data splits. This is an important contribution as published results are often not comparable and sometimes even flawed due to, e.g. pre-training on zero-shot test classes. Second, we compare and analyze a significant number of the state-of-the-art methods in depth, both in the classic zero-shot setting but also in the more realistic generalized zero-shot setting. Finally, we discuss limitations of the current status of the area which can be taken as a basis for advancing it.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xian_Zero-Shot_Learning_-_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yongqin Xian, Bernt Schiele, Zeynep Akata
Zero-Shot Recognition Using Dual Visual-Semantic Mapping Paths	Zero-shot recognition aims to accurately recognize objects of unseen classes by using a shared visual-semantic mapping between the image feature space and the semantic embedding space. This mapping is learned on training data of seen classes and is expected to have transfer ability to unseen classes. In this paper, we tackle this problem by exploiting the intrinsic relationship between the semantic space manifold and the transfer ability of visual-semantic mapping. We formalize their connection and cast zero-shot recognition as a joint optimization problem. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework for zero-shot recognition, which contains dual visual-semantic mapping paths. Our analysis shows this framework can not only apply prior semantic knowledge to infer underlying semantic manifold in the image feature space, but also generate optimized semantic embedding space, which can enhance the transfer ability of the visual-semantic mapping to unseen classes. The proposed method is evaluated for zero-shot recognition on four benchmark datasets, achieving outstanding results.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Li_Zero-Shot_Recognition_Using_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Yanan Li, Donghui Wang, Huanhang Hu, Yuetan Lin, Yueting Zhuang
iCaRL: Incremental Classifier and Representation Learning	A major open problem on the road to artificial intelligence is the development of incrementally learning systems that learn about more and more concepts over time from a stream of data. In this work, we introduce a new training strategy, iCaRL, that allows learning in such a class-incremental way: only the training data for a small number of classes has to be present at the same time and new classes can be added progressively. iCaRL learns strong classifiers and a data representation simultaneously. This distinguishes it from earlier works that were fundamentally limited to fixed data representations and therefore incompatible with deep learning architectures. We show by experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 data that iCaRL can learn many classes incrementally over a long period of time where other strategies quickly fail.	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Rebuffi_iCaRL_Incremental_Classifier_CVPR_2017_paper.html	Sylvestre-Alvise Rebuffi, Alexander Kolesnikov, Georg Sperl, Christoph H.
