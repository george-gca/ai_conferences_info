A Pretrained Language Model for Cyber Threat Intelligence	We present a new BERT model for the cybersecurity domain, CTI-BERT, which can improve the accuracy of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) extraction, enabling organizations to better defend against potential cyber threats. We provide detailed information about the domain corpus collection, the training methodology and its effectiveness for a variety of NLP tasks for the cybersecurity domain. The experiments show that CTI-BERT significantly outperforms several general-domain and security-domain models for these cybersecurity applications indicating that the training data and methodology have a significant impact on the model performance.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.12	Youngja Park, Weiqiu You
BeautifulPrompt: Towards Automatic Prompt Engineering for Text-to-Image Synthesis	Recently, diffusion-based deep generative models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) have shown impressive results in text-to-image synthesis. However, current text-to-image models often require multiple passes of prompt engineering by humans in order to produce satisfactory results for real-world applications. We propose BeautifulPrompt, a deep generative model to produce high-quality prompts from very simple raw descriptions, which enables diffusion-based models to generate more beautiful images. In our work, we first fine-tuned the BeautifulPrompt model over low-quality and high-quality collecting prompt pairs. Then, to ensure that our generated prompts can generate more beautiful images, we further propose a Reinforcement Learning with Visual AI Feedback technique to fine-tune our model to maximize the reward values of the generated prompts, where the reward values are calculated based on the PickScore and the Aesthetic Scores. Our results demonstrate that learning from visual AI feedback promises the potential to improve the quality of generated prompts and images significantly. We further showcase the integration of BeautifulPrompt to a cloud-native AI platform to provide better text-to-image generation service in the cloud.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.1	Tingfeng Cao, Chengyu Wang, Bingyan Liu, Ziheng Wu, Jinhui Zhu, Jun Huang
Deep Metric Learning to Hierarchically Rank - An Application in Product Retrieval	Most e-commerce search engines use customer behavior signals to augment lexical matching and improve search relevance. Many e-commerce companies like Amazon, Alibaba, Ebay etc. operate in multiple countries with country specific stores. However, customer behavior data is sparse in newer stores. To compensate for sparsity of behavioral data in low traffic stores, search engines often use cross-listed products in some form. However, cross-listing across stores is not uniform and in many cases itself sparse. In this paper, we develop a model to identify duplicate and near-duplicate products across stores. Such a model can be used to unify product catalogs worldwide, improve product meta-data or as in our case, use near-duplicate products across multiple to improve search relevance. To capture the product similarity hierarchy, we develop an approach that integrates retrieval and ranking tasks across multiple languages in a single step based on a novel Hierarchical Ranked Multi Similarity (HRMS) Loss that combines Multi-Similarity (MS) loss and Hierarchical Triplet Loss to learn a hierarchical metric space. Our method outperforms strong baselines in terms of catalog coverage and precision of the mappings. We also show via online A/B tests that the product mappings found by our method are successful at improving search quality in low traffic stores, measured in rate of searches with at least one click, significantly by 0.8% and improving cold start product engagement measured as new product clicks significantly by 1.72% in established stores.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.11	Kee Kiat Koo, Ashutosh Joshi, Nishaanth Reddy, Karim Bouyarmane, Ismail Tutar, Vaclav Petricek, Changhe Yuan
Text2Topic: Multi-Label Text Classification System for Efficient Topic Detection in User Generated Content with Zero-Shot Capabilities	Multi-label text classification is a critical task in the industry. It helps to extract structured information from large amount of textual data. We propose Text to Topic (Text2Topic), which achieves high multi-label classification performance by employing a Bi-Encoder Transformer architecture that utilizes concatenation, subtraction, and multiplication of embeddings on both text and topic. Text2Topic also supports zero-shot predictions, produces domain-specific text embeddings, and enables production-scale batch-inference with high throughput. The final model achieves accurate and comprehensive results compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including large language models (LLMs). In this study, a total of 239 topics are defined, and around 1.6 million text-topic pairs annotations (in which 200K are positive) are collected on approximately 120K texts from 3 main data sources on Booking.com. The data is collected with optimized smart sampling and partial labeling. The final Text2Topic model is deployed on a real-world stream processing platform, and it outperforms other models with 92.9% micro mAP, as well as a 75.8% macro mAP score. We summarize the modeling choices which are extensively tested through ablation studies, and share detailed in-production decision-making steps.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.10	Fengjun Wang, Moran Beladev, Ofri Kleinfeld, Elina Frayerman, Tal Shachar, Eran Fainman, Karen Lastmann Assaraf, Sarai Mizrachi, Benjamin Wang
Personalized Dense Retrieval on Global Index for Voice-enabled Conversational Systems	Voice-controlled AI dialogue systems are susceptible to noise from phonetic variations and failure to resolve ambiguous entities. Typically, personalized entity resolution (ER) and/or query rewrites (QR) are deployed to recover from these error modes. Previous work in this field achieves personalization by constraining retrieval search space to personalized indices built from user's historical interactions with the device. While constrained retrieval achieves high precision, predictions are limited to entities in recent user history, which offers low coverage of future requests. Further, maintaining individual indices for millions of users is memory intensive and difficult to scale. In this work, we propose a personalized entity retrieval system that is robust to phonetic noise and ambiguity but is not limited to a personalized index. We achieve this by embedding user listening preferences into a contextual query embedding used in retrieval. We demonstrate our model's ability to correct multiple error modes and show 91% improvement over baseline on the entity retrieval task. Finally, we optimize the end-to-end approach to fit within online latency constraints while maintaining gains in performance.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.9	Masha Belyi, Charlotte Dzialo, Chaitanya Dwivedi, Prajit Muppidi, Kanna Shimizu
MUST&P-SRL: Multi-lingual and Unified Syllabification in Text and Phonetic Domains for Speech Representation Learning	In this paper, we present a methodology for linguistic feature extraction, focusing particularly on automatically syllabifying words in multiple languages, with a design to be compatible with a forced-alignment tool, the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA). In both the textual and phonetic domains, our method focuses on the extraction of phonetic transcriptions from text, stress marks, and a unified automatic syllabification (in text and phonetic domains). The system was built with open-source components and resources. Through an ablation study, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in automatically syllabifying words from several languages (English, French and Spanish). Additionally, we apply the technique to the transcriptions of the CMU ARCTIC dataset, generating valuable annotations available online (https://github.com/noetits/MUST_P-SRL) that are ideal for speech representation learning, speech unit discovery, and disentanglement of speech factors in several speech-related fields.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.8	Noé Tits
CDD: A Large Scale Dataset for Legal Intelligence Research	As an important application of Artificial Intelligence, legal intelligence has recently attracted the attention of many researchers. Previous works investigated diverse issues like predicting crimes, predicting outcomes of judicial debates, or extracting information/knowledge from various kinds of legal documents. Although many advances have been made, the research on supporting prediction of court judgments remains relatively scarce, while the lack of large-scale data resources limits the development of this research.In this paper, we present a novel, large-size Court Debate Dataset (CDD), which includes 30,481 court cases, totaling 1,144,425 utterances. CDD contains real-world conversations involving judges, plaintiffs and defendants in court trials. To construct this dataset we have invited experienced judges to design appropriate labels for data records. We then asked law school students to provide annotations based on the defined labels. The dataset can be applied to several downstream tasks, such as text summarization, dialogue generation, text classification, etc. We introduce the details of the different tasks in the rapidly developing field of legal intelligence, the research of which can be fostered thanks to our dataset, and we provide the corresponding benchmark performance.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.7	Changzhen Ji, Yating Zhang, Adam Jatowt, Haipang Wu
Efficient Transformer Knowledge Distillation: A Performance Review	As pretrained transformer language models continue to achieve state-of-the-art performance, the Natural Language Processing community has pushed for advances in model compression and efficient attention mechanisms to address high computational requirements and limited input sequence length. Despite these separate efforts, no investigation has been done into the intersection of these two fields. In this work, we provide an evaluation of model compression via knowledge distillation on efficient attention transformers. We provide cost-performance trade-offs for the compression of state-of-the-art efficient attention architectures and the gains made in performance in comparison to their full attention counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a new long-context Named Entity Recognition dataset, GONERD, to train and test the performance of NER models on long sequences. We find that distilled efficient attention transformers can preserve a significant amount of original model performance, preserving up to 98.6% across short-context tasks (GLUE, SQUAD, CoNLL-2003), up to 94.6% across long-context Question-and-Answering tasks (HotpotQA, TriviaQA), and up to 98.8% on long-context Named Entity Recognition (GONERD), while decreasing inference times by up to 57.8%. We find that, for most models on most tasks, performing knowledge distillation is an effective method to yield high-performing efficient attention models with low costs.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.6	Nathan Brown, Ashton Williamson, Tahj Anderson, Logan Lawrence
Gatekeeper to save COGS and improve efficiency of Text Prediction	The text prediction (TP) workflow calls a Large Language Model (LLM), almost, after every character to get subsequent sequence of characters, till user accepts a suggestion. The confidence score of the prediction is commonly used for filtering the results to ensure that only correct predictions are shown to user. As LLMs require massive amounts of computation and storage, such an approach incurs network and high execution cost. So, we propose a Model gatekeeper (GK) to stop the LLM calls that will result in incorrect predictions at client application level itself. This way a GK can save cost of model inference and improve user experience by not showing the incorrect predictions. We demonstrate that use of a model gatekeeper saved approx 46.6% of COGS for TP, at the cost of approx 4.5% loss in character saving. Use of GK also improved the efficiency (suggestion rate) of TP model by 73%.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.5	Nidhi Tiwari, Sneha Kola, Milos Milunovic, Si-qing Chen, Marjan Slavkovski
Towards Effective Automatic Debt Collection with Persona Awareness	Understanding debtor personas is crucial for collectors to empathize with debtors and develop more effective collection strategies. In this paper, we take the first step towards comprehensively investigating the significance of debtor personas and present a successful commercial practice on automatic debt collection agents. Specifically, we organize the debtor personas into a taxonomy and construct a persona-aware conversation dataset. Building upon it, we implement a simple yet effective persona-aware agent called PAD. After two-month online testing, PAD increases the recovery rate by 3.31% and collects an additional ~100K RMB. Our commercial practice brings inspiration to the debt collection industry by providing an effective automatic solution.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.4	Tong Zhang, Junhong Liu, Chen Huang, Jia Liu, Hongru Liang, Zujie Wen, Wenqiang Lei
A Comparative Analysis of Task-Agnostic Distillation Methods for Compressing Transformer Language Models	Large language models have become a vital component in modern NLP, achieving state of the art performance in a variety of tasks. However, they are often inefficient for real-world deployment due to their expensive inference costs. Knowledge distillation is a promising technique to improve their efficiency while retaining most of their effectiveness. In this paper, we reproduce, compare and analyze several representative methods for task-agnostic (general-purpose) distillation of Transformer language models. Our target of study includes Output Distribution (OD) transfer, Hidden State (HS) transfer with various layer mapping strategies, and Multi-Head Attention (MHA) transfer based on MiniLMv2. Through our extensive experiments, we study the effectiveness of each method for various student architectures in both monolingual (English) and multilingual settings. Overall, we show that MHA transfer based on MiniLMv2 is generally the best option for distillation and explain the potential reasons behind its success. Moreover, we show that HS transfer remains as a competitive baseline, especially under a sophisticated layer mapping strategy, while OD transfer consistently lags behind other approaches. Findings from this study helped us deploy efficient yet effective student models for latency-critical applications.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.3	Takuma Udagawa, Aashka Trivedi, Michele Merler, Bishwaranjan Bhattacharjee
Enhancing Language Model with Unit Test Techniques for Efficient Regular Expression Generation	Recent research has investigated the use of generative language models to produce regular expressions with semantic-based approaches. However, these approaches have shown shortcomings in practical applications, particularly in terms of functional correctness, which refers to the ability to reproduce the intended function inputs by the user. To address this issue, we present a novel method called Unit-Test Driven Reinforcement Learning (UTD-RL). Our approach differs from previous methods by taking into account the crucial aspect of functional correctness and transforming it into a differentiable gradient feedback using policy gradient techniques. In which functional correctness can be evaluated through Unit Tests, a testing method that ensures regular expressions meets its design and performs as intended. Experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating regular expressions. This method has been employed in a regulatory scenario where regular expressions can be utilized to ensure that all online content is free from non-compliant elements, thereby significantly reducing the workload of relevant personnel.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.2	Chenhui Mao, Xiexiong Lin, Xin Jin, Xin Zhang
Retrieval-Enhanced Dual Encoder Training for Product Matching	Product matching is the task of matching a seller-listed item to an appropriate product. It is a critical task for an e-commerce platform, and the approach needs to be efficient to run in a large-scale setting. A dual encoder approach has been a common practice for product matching recently, due to its high performance and computation efficiency. In this paper, we propose a two-stage training for the dual encoder model. Stage 1 trained a dual encoder to identify the more informative training data. Stage 2 then train on the more informative data to get a better dual encoder model. This technique is a learned approach for building training data. We evaluate the retrieval-enhanced training on two different datasets: a publicly available Large-Scale Product Matching dataset and a real-world e-commerce dataset containing 47 million products. Experiment results show that our approach improved by 2% F1 on the public dataset and 9% F1 on the real-world e-commerce dataset.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.22	Justin Chiu
Angel: Enterprise Search System for the Non-Profit Industry	"Non-profit industry need a system for accurately matching fund-seekers (e.g., AMERICAN NATIONAL RED CROSS) with fund-givers (e.g., BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION) aligned in cause (e.g., cancer) and target beneficiary group (e.g., children). In this paper, we create an enterprise search system ""ANGEL"" for the non-profit industry that takes a fund-giver's mission description as input and returns a ranked list of fund-seekers as output, and vice-versa. ANGEL employs ColBERT, a neural information retrieval model, which we enhance by exploiting the two techniques of (a) Syntax-aware local attention (SLA) to combine syntactic information in the mission description with multi-head self-attention and (b) Dense Pseudo Relevance Feedback (DPRF) for augmentation of short mission descriptions. We create a mapping dictionary ""non-profit-dict"" to curate a ""non-profit-search database"" containing information on 594K fund-givers and 194K fund-seekers from IRS-990 filings for the non-profit industry search engines . We also curate a ""non-profit-evaluation"" dataset containing scored matching between 463 fund-givers and 100 fund-seekers. The research is in collaboration with a philanthropic startup that identifies itself as an ""AI matching platform, fundraising assistant, and philanthropy search base."" Domain experts at the philanthropic startup annotate the non-profit evaluation dataset and continuously evaluate the performance of ANGEL. ANGEL achieves an improvement of 0.14 MAP@10 and 0.16 MRR@10 over the state-of-the-art baseline on the non-profit evaluation dataset. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first effort at building an enterprise search engine based on neural information retrieval for the non-profit industry."	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.77	Saiful Haq, Ashutosh Sharma, Pushpak Bhattacharyya
WordArt Designer: User-Driven Artistic Typography Synthesis using Large Language Models	This paper introduces WordArt Designer, a user-driven framework for artistic typography synthesis, relying on the Large Language Model (LLM). The system incorporates four key modules: the LLM Engine, SemTypo, StyTypo, and TexTypo modules. 1) The LLM Engine, empowered by the LLM (e.g. GPT-3.5), interprets user inputs and generates actionable prompts for the other modules, thereby transforming abstract concepts into tangible designs. 2) The SemTypo module optimizes font designs using semantic concepts, striking a balance between artistic transformation and readability. 3) Building on the semantic layout provided by the SemTypo module, the StyTypo module creates smooth, refined images. 4) The TexTypo module further enhances the design's aesthetics through texture rendering, enabling the generation of inventive textured fonts. Notably, WordArt Designer highlights the fusion of generative AI with artistic typography.

EfficientOCR: An Extensible, Open-Source Package for Efficiently Digitizing World Knowledge	Billions of public domain documents remain trapped in hard copy or lack an accurate digitization. Modern natural language processing methods cannot be used to index, retrieve, and summarize their texts; conduct computational textual analyses; or extract information for statistical analyses, and these texts cannot be incorporated into language model training. Given the diversity and sheer quantity of public domain texts, liberating them at scale requires optical character recognition (OCR) that is accurate, extremely cheap to deploy, and sample-efficient to customize to novel collections, languages, and character sets. Existing OCR engines, largely designed for small-scale commercial applications in high resource languages, often fall short of these requirements. EffOCR (EfficientOCR), a novel open-source OCR package, meets both the computational and sample efficiency requirements for liberating texts at scale by abandoning the sequence-to-sequence architecture typically used for OCR, which takes representations from a learned vision model as inputs to a learned language model. Instead, EffOCR models OCR as a character or word-level image retrieval problem. EffOCR is cheap and sample efficient to train, as the model only needs to learn characters' visual appearance and not how they are used in sequence to form language. Models in the EffOCR model zoo can be deployed off-the-shelf with only a few lines of code and include lightweight models designed for mobile phones that are extremely cheap to deploy. Importantly, EffOCR also allows for easy, sample efficient customization with a simple model training interface and minimal labeling requirements due to its sample efficiency. We illustrate the utility of EffOCR by cheaply and accurately digitizing 20 million historical U.S. newspaper scans, evaluating zero-shot performance on randomly selected documents from the U.S. National Archives, and accurately digitizing a Japanese document collection for which all other OCR solutions failed.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.52	Tom Bryan, Jacob Carlson, Abhishek Arora, Melissa Dell
Creative Natural Language Generation	Large language models such as GPT-3, GPT4, Claude etc., have advanced the state of the art in several natural language generation tasks such as text summarization and machine translation. However when it comes to open-ended tasks with a focus on creativity such as generating stories, poetry, or various forms of figurative language, these state-of-the-art language models are often found to be inadequate. This tutorial aims to bring awareness of the important and emerging research area of open-domain creative generation, with a focus on language generation while also touching on multi-modal generation (e.g., image captioning, visual metaphors). It targets natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) researchers as well as creative writing practitioners who are interested in building systems that are capable of emulating as well as augmenting human creativity. In particular, we will review recent studies on creative language generation both at the sentence level as well as longer forms of text. We will provide the audiences with a holistic view of 1) the importance and challenges of building creative language generation systems; 2) how we incorporate content planning, domain knowledge and creativity specific heuristics for different forms of creative language generation such as story, poetry, humor, metaphors etc 3) how can we build better evaluation methods for creative text generation? In particular, how could the recent advancement of AI shape the future workforce for creativity? We will conclude the tutorial by outlining future research directions in this area.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-tutorial.6	Tuhin Chakrabarty, Vishakh Padmakumar, He He, Nanyun Peng
Mitigating Societal Harms in Large Language Models	Numerous recent studies have highlighted societal harms that can be caused by language technologies deployed in the wild. While several surveys, tutorials, and workshops have discussed the risks of harms in specific contexts – e.g., detecting and mitigating gender bias in NLP models – no prior work has developed a unified typology of technical approaches for mitigating harms of language generation models. Our tutorial is based on a survey we recently wrote that proposes such a typology. We will provide an overview of potential social issues in language generation, including toxicity, social biases, misinformation, factual inconsistency, and privacy violations. Our primary focus will be on how to systematically identify risks, and how eliminate them at various stages of model development, from data collection, to model development, to inference/language generation. Through this tutorial, we aim to equip NLP researchers and engineers with a suite of practical tools for mitigating safety risks from pretrained language generation models.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-tutorial.5	Sachin Kumar, Vidhisha Balachandran, Lucille Njoo, Antonios Anastasopoulos, Yulia Tsvetkov
LLM-driven Instruction Following: Progresses and Concerns	The progress of natural language processing (NLP) is primarily driven by machine learning that optimizes a system on a large-scale set of task-specific labeled examples. This learning paradigm limits the ability of machines to have the same capabilities as humans in handling new tasks since humans can often solve unseen tasks with a couple of examples accompanied by task instructions. In addition, we may not have a chance to prepare task-specific examples of large-volume for new tasks because we cannot foresee what task needs to be addressed next and how complex to annotate for it. Therefore, task instructions act as a novel and promising resource for supervision. This tutorial targets researchers and practitioners who are interested in AI and ML technologies for NLP generalization in a low-shot scenario. In particular, we will present a diverse thread of instruction-driven NLP studies that try to answer the following questions: (i) What is task instruction? (ii) How is the process of creating datasets and evaluating systems conducted? (iii) How to encode task instructions? (iv) When and why do some instructions work better? (v) What concerns remain in LLM-driven instruction following? We will discuss several lines of frontier research that tackle those challenges and will conclude the tutorial by outlining directions for further investigation.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-tutorial.4	Wenpeng Yin, Qinyuan Ye, Pengfei Liu, Xiang Ren, Hinrich Schütze
Designing, Evaluating, and Learning from Humans Interacting with NLP Models	The rapid advancement of natural language processing (NLP) research has led to various applications spanning a wide range of domains that require models to interact with humans – e.g., chatbots responding to human inquiries, machine translation systems assisting human translators, designers prompting Large Language Models for co-creation or prototyping AI-infused applications, etc. In these cases, humans interaction is key to the success of NLP applications; any potential misconceptions or differences might lead to error cascades at the subsequent stages. Such interaction involves a lot of design choices around models, e.g. the sensitivity of interfaces, the impact of design choice and evaluation questions, etc. This tutorial aims to provide a systematic and up-to-date overview of key considerations and effective approaches for studying human-NLP model interactions. Our tutorial will focus specifically on the scenario where end users – lay people and domain experts who have access to NLP models but are less familiar with NLP techniques – use or collaborate with deployed models. Throughout the tutorial, we will use five case studies (on classifier-assisted decision making, machine-aided translation, dialog systems, and prompting) to cover three major themes: (1) how to conduct human-in-the-loop usability evaluations to ensure that models are capable of interacting with humans; (2) how to design user interfaces (UIs) and interaction mechanisms that provide end users with easy access to NLP models; (3) how to learn and improve NLP models through the human interactions. We will use best practices from HCI to ground our discussion, and will highlight current challenges and future directions.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-tutorial.3	Tongshuang Wu, Diyi Yang, Sebastin Santy
Security Challenges in Natural Language Processing Models	Large-scale natural language processing models have been developed and integrated into numerous applications, given the advantage of their remarkable performance. Nonetheless, the security concerns associated with these models prevent the widespread adoption of these black-box machine learning models. In this tutorial, we will dive into three emerging security issues in NLP research, i.e., backdoor attacks, private data leakage, and imitation attacks. These threats will be introduced in accordance with their threatening usage scenarios, attack methodologies, and defense technologies.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-tutorial.2	Qiongkai Xu, Xuanli He
NLP+Vis: NLP Meets Visualization	Natural language and visualization (Vis) are two powerful modalities of human communication. The goal of this tutorial is to push forward the agenda of tightly integrating these two modalities. To this end, the tutorial will introduce NLP+Vis with a focus on two main threads of work: (i) NLP for Vis: How to develop and adapt state-of-the-art NLP models for solving various visualization tasks? and (ii) Vis for NLP: How to leverage visualization techniques to interpret and explain complex NLP models effectively? The tutorial will first motivate why NLP+Vis is an important area of research and provide an overview of research topics on combining NLP and Vis techniques. Then an overview of state-of-the-art deep learning models for NLP will be covered. Next, we will provide an overview of applying visualization techniques to help make NLP models more interpretable and explainable. In the final part, we will focus on various application tasks at the intersection of NLP and Vis. We will conclude with an interactive discussion of future challenges for NLP+Vis applications. The audience will include researchers interested in applying NLP for visualizations as well as others who focus more generally at the intersection of machine learning and visualization.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-tutorial.1	Shafiq Joty, Enamul Hoque, Jesse Vig

Video-LLaMA: An Instruction-tuned Audio-Visual Language Model for Video Understanding	We present Video-LLaMA, a multi-modal framework that empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) with the capability of understanding both visual and auditory content in the video. Video-LLaMA bootstraps cross-modal training from the frozen pre-trained visual & audio encoders and the frozen LLMs. Unlike previous works that complement LLMs to process the visual or audio signals only, Video-LLaMA enables video comprehension by tackling two challenges: (1) capturing the temporal changes in visual scenes, (2) integrating audio-visual signals. To counter the first challenge, we propose a Video Q-former to assemble a pre-trained image encoder into our video encoder and introduce a video-to-text generation task to learn video-language correspondence. For the second challenge, we leverage ImageBind, a universal embedding model aligning multiple modalities, as the pre-trained audio encoder and introduce an Audio Q-former on top of ImageBind to learn reasonable auditory query embeddings for the LLM module. To align the output of both visual & audio encoders with LLM's embedding space, we first train Video-LLaMA on massive video/image-caption pairs and then tune our model with visual-instruction datasets of moderate amount but higher quality. We found Video-LLaMA shows the ability to perceive and comprehend video content and generate meaningful responses grounded in the visual and auditory information presented in the videos.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.49	Hang Zhang, Xin Li, Lidong Bing
CoLLiE: Collaborative Training of Large Language Models in an Efficient Way	Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly pivotal in a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Access to pre-trained models, courtesy of the open-source community, has made it possible to adapt these models to specific applications for enhanced performance. However, the substantial resources required for training these models necessitate efficient solutions. This paper introduces CoLLiE, an efficient library that facilitates collaborative training of large language models using 3D parallelism, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, and optimizers such as Lion, Adan, Sophia, and LOMO. With its modular design and comprehensive functionality, CoLLiE offers a balanced blend of efficiency, ease of use, and customization. CoLLiE has proven superior training efficiency in comparison with prevalent solutions in pre-training and fine-tuning scenarios. Furthermore, we provide an empirical evaluation of the correlation between model size and GPU memory consumption under different optimization methods, as well as an analysis of the throughput. Lastly, we carry out a comprehensive comparison of various optimizers and PEFT methods within the instruction-tuning context. CoLLiE is available at https://github.com/OpenLMLab/collie.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.48	Kai Lv, Shuo Zhang, Tianle Gu, Shuhao Xing, Jiawei Hong, Keyu Chen, Xiaoran Liu, Yuqing Yang, Honglin Guo, Tengxiao Liu, Yu Sun, Qipeng Guo, Hang Yan, Xipeng Qiu
CocoSciSum: A Scientific Summarization Toolkit with Compositional Controllability	We present a novel toolkit for controlled summarization of scientific documents, designed for the specific needs of the scientific community. Our system generates summaries based on user preferences, adjusting key attributes specifically of length and keyword inclusion. A distinguishing feature is its ability to manage multiple attributes concurrently, demonstrating Compositional Controllability for Scientific Summarization (CocoSciSum). Benchmarked against the strong Flan-T5 baseline, CocoSciSum exhibits superior performance on both the quality of summaries generated and the control over single and multiple attributes. Moreover, CocoSciSum is a user-centric toolkit, supporting user preferences expressed in natural language instructions, and accommodating diverse input document formats.

ModelScope-Agent: Building Your Customizable Agent System with Open-source Large Language Models	Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities to comprehend human intentions, engage in reasoning, and design planning-like behavior. To further unleash the power of LLMs to accomplish complex tasks, there is a growing trend to build agent frameworks that equips LLMs, such as ChatGPT, with tool-use abilities to connect with massive external APIs. In this work, we introduce ModelScope-Agent, a general and customizable agent framework for real-world applications, based on open-source LLMs as controllers. It provides a user-friendly system library, with a customizable engine design to support model training on multiple open-source LLMs, while also enabling seamless integration with both model APIs and common APIs in a unified way. To equip the LLMs with tool-use abilities, a comprehensive framework has been proposed spanning tool-use data collection, tool retrieval, tool registration, memory control, customized model training, and evaluation for practical real-world applications. Finally, we showcase ModelScopeGPT, a real-world intelligent assistant of ModelScope Community based on the ModelScope-Agent framework, which is able to connect open-source LLMs with more than 1000 public AI models and localized community knowledge in ModelScope.

PaperMage: A Unified Toolkit for Processing, Representing, and Manipulating Visually-Rich Scientific Documents	Despite growing interest in applying natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) models to the scholarly domain, scientific documents remain challenging to work with. They're often in difficult-to-use PDF formats, and the ecosystem of models to process them is fragmented and incomplete. We introduce PaperMage, an open-source Python toolkit for analyzing and processing visually-rich, structured scientific documents. PaperMage offers clean and intuitive abstractions for seamlessly representing and manipulating both textual and visual document elements. PaperMage achieves this by integrating disparate state-of-the-art NLP and CV models into a unified framework, and provides turn-key recipes for common scientific document processing use-cases. PaperMage has powered multiple research prototypes of AI applications over scientific documents, along with Semantic Scholar's large-scale production system for processing millions of PDFs.

ZhuJiu: A Multi-dimensional, Multi-faceted Chinese Benchmark for Large Language Models	"The unprecedented performance of LLMs requires comprehensive and accurate evaluation. We argue that for LLMs evaluation, benchmarks need to be comprehensive and systematic. To this end, we propose the Zhujiu benchmark, which has the following strengths: (1) Multi-dimensional ability coverage: We comprehensively evaluate LLMs across 7 ability dimensions covering 51 tasks. Especially, we also propose a new benchmark that focus on knowledge ability of LLMs. (2) Multi-faceted evaluation methods collaboration: We use 3 different yet complementary evaluation methods to comprehensively evaluate LLMs, which can ensure the authority and accuracy of the evaluation results. (3) Comprehensive Chinese benchmark: ZhuJiu is the pioneering benchmark that fully assesses LLMs in Chinese, while also providing equally robust evaluation abilities in English. (4) Avoiding potential data leakage: To avoid data leakage, we construct evaluation data specifically for 37 tasks. We evaluate 10 current mainstream LLMs, and conduct an in-depth discussion and analysis of their results. The ZhuJiu benchmark and open-participation leaderboard are publicly released at <a href=""http://www.zhujiu-benchmark.com"" class=""acl-markup-url"">http://www.zhujiu-benchmark.com and we also provide a demo video at <a href=""https://youtu.be/qypkJ89L1Ic."" class=""acl-markup-url"">https://youtu.be/qypkJ89L1Ic."	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.44	Baoli Zhang, Haining Xie, Pengfan Du, Junhao Chen, Pengfei Cao, Yubo Chen, Shengping Liu, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao
Prompterator: Iterate Efficiently towards More Effective Prompts	With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) the process known as prompting, which entices the LLM to solve an arbitrary language processing task without the need for finetuning, has risen to prominence. Finding well-performing prompts, however, is a non-trivial task which requires experimentation in order to arrive at a prompt that solves a specific task. When a given task does not readily reduce to one that can be easily measured with well established metrics, human evaluation of the results obtained by prompting is often necessary. In this work we present prompterator, a tool that helps the user interactively iterate over various potential prompts and choose the best performing one based on human feedback. It is distributed as an open source package with out-of-the-box support for various LLM providers and was designed to be easily extensible.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.43	Samuel Sučik, Daniel Skala, Andrej Švec, Peter Hraška, Marek Šuppa
Descriptive Knowledge Graph in Biomedical Domain	We present a novel system that automatically extracts and generates informative and descriptive sentences from the biomedical corpus and facilitates the efficient search for relational knowledge. Unlike previous search engines or exploration systems that retrieve unconnected passages, our system organizes descriptive sentences as a relational graph, enabling researchers to explore closely related biomedical entities (e.g., diseases treated by a chemical) or indirectly connected entities (e.g., potential drugs for treating a disease). Our system also uses ChatGPT and a fine-tuned relation synthesis model to generate concise and reliable descriptive sentences from retrieved information, reducing the need for extensive human reading effort. With our system, researchers can easily obtain both high-level knowledge and detailed references and interactively steer to the information of interest. We spotlight the application of our system in COVID-19 research, illustrating its utility in areas such as drug repurposing and literature curation.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.42	Kerui Zhu, Jie Huang, Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang
LM-Polygraph: Uncertainty Estimation for Language Models	"Recent advancements in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have paved the way for a myriad of groundbreaking applications in various fields. However, a significant challenge arises as these models often ""hallucinate"", i.e., fabricate facts without providing users an apparent means to discern the veracity of their statements. Uncertainty estimation (UE) methods are one path to safer, more responsible, and more effective use of LLMs. However, to date, research on UE methods for LLMs has been focused primarily on theoretical rather than engineering contributions. In this work, we tackle this issue by introducing LM-Polygraph, a framework with implementations of a battery of state-of-the-art UE methods for LLMs in text generation tasks, with unified program interfaces in Python. Additionally, it introduces an extendable benchmark for consistent evaluation of UE techniques by researchers, and a demo web application that enriches the standard chat dialog with confidence scores, empowering end-users to discern unreliable responses. LM-Polygraph is compatible with the most recent LLMs, including BLOOMz, LLaMA-2, ChatGPT, and GPT-4, and is designed to support future releases of similarly-styled LMs."	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.41	Ekaterina Fadeeva, Roman Vashurin, Akim Tsvigun, Artem Vazhentsev, Sergey Petrakov, Kirill Fedyanin, Daniil Vasilev, Elizaveta Goncharova, Alexander Panchenko, Maxim Panov, Timothy Baldwin, Artem Shelmanov
NeMo Guardrails: A Toolkit for Controllable and Safe LLM Applications with Programmable Rails	NeMo Guardrails is an open-source toolkit for easily adding programmable guardrails to LLM-based conversational systems. Guardrails (or rails for short) are a specific way of controlling the output of an LLM, such as not talking about topics considered harmful, following a predefined dialogue path, using a particular language style, and more. There are several mechanisms that allow LLM providers and developers to add guardrails that are embedded into a specific model at training, e.g. using model alignment. Using a runtime inspired from dialogue management, NeMo Guardrails provides a different approach by allowing developers to add programmable rails to LLM applications - these are user-defined, independent of the underlying LLM, and interpretable. Our initial results show that the proposed approach can be used with several LLM providers to develop controllable and safe LLM applications using programmable rails.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.40	Traian Rebedea, Razvan Dinu, Makesh Narsimhan Sreedhar, Christopher Parisien, Jonathan Cohen
Prompt2Model: Generating Deployable Models from Natural Language Instructions	"Large language models (LLMs) enable system builders today to create competent NLP systems through prompting, where they only need to describe the task in natural language and provide a few examples. However, in other ways, LLMs are a step backward from traditional special-purpose NLP models; they require extensive computational resources for deployment and can be gated behind APIs. In this paper, we propose Prompt2Model, a general-purpose method that takes a natural language task description like the prompts provided to LLMs, and uses it to train a special-purpose model that is conducive to deployment. This is done through a multi-step process of retrieval of existing datasets and pretrained models, dataset generation using LLMs, and supervised fine-tuning on these retrieved and generated datasets. Over three tasks, we demonstrate that given the same few-shot prompt as input, Prompt2Model trains models that outperform the results of a strong LLM, gpt-3.5-turbo, by an average of 20% while being up to 700 times smaller. We also show that this data can be used to obtain reliable performance estimates of model performance, enabling model developers to assess model reliability before deployment. Prompt2Model is available open-source at https://github.com/neulab/prompt2model.

NewsSense: Reference-free Verification via Cross-document Comparison	"We present NewsSense, a novel sensemaking tool and reading interface designed to collect and integrate information from multiple news articles on a central topic. NewsSense provides ""reference-free verification,"" augmenting a central grounding article of the user's choice by: (1) linking to related articles from different sources; and (2) providing inline highlights on how specific claims are either supported or contradicted by information from other articles. Using NewsSense, users can seamlessly digest and cross-check multiple information sources without disturbing their natural reading flow. Our pilot study shows that NewsSense has the potential to help users identify key information, verify the credibility of news articles, explore different perspectives, and understand what content is supported, contradicted, or missing."	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.39	Jeremiah Milbauer, Ziqi Ding, Zhijin Wu, Tongshuang Wu
CHAMP: Efficient Annotation and Consolidation of Cluster Hierarchies	Various NLP tasks require a complex hierarchical structure over nodes, where each node is a cluster of items. Examples include generating entailment graphs, hierarchical cross-document coreference resolution, annotating event and subevent relations, etc. To enable efficient annotation of such hierarchical structures, we release CHAMP, an open source tool allowing to incrementally construct both clusters and hierarchy simultaneously over any type of texts. This incremental approach significantly reduces annotation time compared to the common pairwise annotation approach and also guarantees maintaining transitivity at the cluster and hierarchy levels. Furthermore, CHAMP includes a consolidation mode, where an adjudicator can easily compare multiple cluster hierarchy annotations and resolve disagreements.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.37	Arie Cattan, Tom Hope, Doug Downey, Roy Bar-Haim, Lilach Eden, Yoav Kantor, Ido Dagan
Reaction Miner: An Integrated System for Chemical Reaction Extraction from Textual Data	Chemical reactions, as a core entity in the realm of chemistry, hold crucial implications in diverse areas ranging from hands-on laboratory research to advanced computational drug design. Despite a burgeoning interest in employing NLP techniques to extract these reactions, aligning this task with the real-world requirements of chemistry practitioners remains an ongoing challenge. In this paper, we present Reaction Miner, a system specifically designed to interact with raw scientific literature, delivering precise and more informative chemical reactions. Going beyond mere extraction, Reaction Miner integrates a holistic workflow: it accepts PDF files as input, bypassing the need for pre-processing and bolstering user accessibility. Subsequently, a text segmentation module ensures that the refined text encapsulates complete chemical reactions, augmenting the accuracy of extraction. Moreover, Reaction Miner broadens the scope of existing pre-defined reaction roles, including vital attributes previously neglected, thereby offering a more comprehensive depiction of chemical reactions. Evaluations conducted by chemistry domain users highlight the efficacy of each module in our system, demonstrating Reaction Miner as a powerful tool in this field.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.36	Ming Zhong, Siru Ouyang, Yizhu Jiao, Priyanka Kargupta, Leo Luo, Yanzhen Shen, Bobby Zhou, Xianrui Zhong, Xuan Liu, Hongxiang Li, Jinfeng Xiao, Minhao Jiang, Vivian Hu, Xuan Wang, Heng Ji, Martin Burke, Huimin Zhao, Jiawei Han
CAMRA: Copilot for AMR Annotation	In this paper, we introduce CAMRA (Copilot for AMR Annotatations), a cutting-edge web-based tool designed for constructing Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) from natural language text. CAMRA offers a novel approach to deep lexical semantics annotation such as AMR, treating AMR annotation akin to coding in programming languages. Leveraging the familiarity of programming paradigms, CAMRA encompasses all essential features of existing AMR editors, including example lookup, while going a step further by integrating Propbank roleset lookup as an autocomplete feature within the tool. Notably, CAMRA incorporates AMR parser models as coding co-pilots, greatly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of AMR annotators.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.35	Jon Cai, Shafiuddin Rehan Ahmed, Julia Bonn, Kristin Wright-Bettner, Martha Palmer, James H.

DRGCoder: Explainable Clinical Coding for the Early Prediction of Diagnostic-Related Groups	Medical claim coding is the process of transforming medical records, usually presented as free texts written by clinicians, or discharge summaries, into structured codes in a classification system such as ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) or DRG (Diagnosis-Related Group) codes. This process is essential for medical billing and transitional care; however, manual coding is time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive. To solve these issues, we propose DRGCoder, an explainability-enhanced clinical claim coding system for the early prediction of medical severity DRGs (MS-DRGs), a classification system that categorizes patients' hospital stays into various DRG groups based on the severity of illness and mortality risk. The DRGCoder framework introduces a novel multi-task Transformer model for MS-DRG prediction, modeling both the DRG labels of the discharge summaries and the important, or salient words within he discharge summaries. We allow users to inspect DRGCoder's reasoning by visualizing the weights for each word of the input. Additionally, DRGCoder allows users to identify diseases within discharge summaries and compare across multiple discharge summaries. Our demo is available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/danielhajialigol/DRGCoder.

RESIN-EDITOR's unique features include hierarchical graph visualization, comprehensive source tracing, and interactive user editing, which significantly outperforms existing Information Extraction (IE) visualization tools in both IE result analysis and general model improvements. In our evaluation of RESIN-EDITOR, we demonstrate ways in which our tool is effective in understanding complex events and enhancing system performances. The source code, a video demonstration, and a live website for RESIN-EDITOR have been made publicly available.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.33	Khanh Duy Nguyen, Zixuan Zhang, Reece Suchocki, Sha Li, Martha Palmer, Susan Windisch Brown, Jiawei Han, Heng Ji
SynJax: Structured Probability Distributions for JAX	The development of deep learning software libraries enabled significant progress in the field by allowing users to focus on modeling, while letting the library to take care of the tedious and time-consuming task of optimizing execution for modern hardware accelerators. However, this has benefited only particular types of deep learning models, such as Transformers, whose primitives map easily to the vectorized computation. The models that explicitly account for structured objects, such as trees and segmentations, did not benefit equally because they require custom algorithms that are difficult to implement in a vectorized form. SynJax directly addresses this problem by providing an efficient vectorized implementation of inference algorithms for structured distributions covering alignment, tagging, segmentation, constituency trees and spanning trees. This is done by exploiting the connection between algorithms for automatic differentiation and probabilistic inference. With SynJax we can build large-scale differentiable models that explicitly model structure in the data.

InsightPilot: An LLM-Empowered Automated Data Exploration System	Exploring data is crucial in data analysis, as it helps users understand and interpret the data more effectively. However, performing effective data exploration requires in-depth knowledge of the dataset, the user intent and expertise in data analysis techniques. Not being familiar with either can create obstacles that make the process time-consuming and overwhelming. To address this issue, we introduce InsightPilot, an LLM (Large Language Model)-based, automated data exploration system designed to simplify the data exploration process. InsightPilot features a set of carefully designed analysis actions that streamline the data exploration process. Given a natural language question, InsightPilot collaborates with the LLM to issue a sequence of analysis actions, explore the data and generate insights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of InsightPilot in a user study and a case study, showing how it can help users gain valuable insights from their datasets.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.31	Pingchuan Ma, Rui Ding, Shuai Wang, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang
Thresh: A Unified, Customizable and Deployable Platform for Fine-Grained Text Evaluation	Fine-grained, span-level human evaluation has emerged as a reliable and robust method for evaluating text generation tasks such as summarization, simplification, machine translation and news generation, and the derived annotations have been useful for training automatic metrics and improving language models. However, existing annotation tools implemented for these evaluation frameworks lack the adaptability to be extended to different domains or languages, or modify annotation settings according to user needs; and, the absence of a unified annotated data format inhibits the research in multi-task learning. In this paper, we introduce Thresh, a unified, customizable and deployable platform for fine-grained evaluation. With a single YAML configuration file, users can build and test an annotation interface for any framework within minutes – all in one web browser window. To facilitate collaboration and sharing, Thresh provides a community hub that hosts a collection of fine-grained frameworks and corresponding annotations made and collected by the community, covering a wide range of NLP tasks. For deployment, Thresh offers multiple options for any scale of annotation projects from small manual inspections to large crowdsourcing ones. Additionally, we introduce a Python library to streamline the entire process from typology design and deployment to annotation processing.

SAGEViz: SchemA GEneration and Visualization	Schema induction involves creating a graph representation depicting how events unfold in a scenario. We present SAGEViz, an intuitive and modular tool that utilizes human-AI collaboration to create and update complex schema graphs efficiently, where multiple annotators (humans and models) can work simultaneously on a schema graph from any domain. The tool consists of two components: (1) a curation component powered by plug-and-play event language models to create and expand event sequences while human annotators validate and enrich the sequences to build complex hierarchical schemas, and (2) an easy-to-use visualization component to visualize schemas at varying levels of hierarchy. Using supervised and few-shot approaches, our event language models can continually predict relevant events starting from a seed event. We conduct a user study and show that users need less effort in terms of interaction steps with SAGEViz to generate schemas of better quality. We also include a video demonstrating the system.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.29	Sugam Devare, Mahnaz Koupaee, Gautham Gunapati, Sayontan Ghosh, Sai Vallurupalli, Yash Kumar Lal, Francis Ferraro, Nathanael Chambers, Greg Durrett, Raymond Mooney, Katrin Erk, Niranjan Balasubramanian
Okapi: Instruction-tuned Large Language Models in Multiple Languages with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback	A key technology for large language models (LLMs) involves instruction tuning that helps align the models' responses with human expectations to realize impressive learning abilities. Two major approaches for instruction tuning characterize supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which are applied to produce the best commercial LLMs. To improve the accessibility of LLMs, various instruction-tuned open-source LLMs have also been introduced recently. However, existing open-source LLMs have only been instruction-tuned for English and a few popular languages, thus hindering their accessibility to many other languages in the world. In addition, SFT has been used as the only approach to instruction-tune open-source LLMs for multiple languages. This has left a significant gap for fine-tuned LLMs based on RLHF in diverse languages and raised important questions on how RLHF can boost the performance of multilingual instruction tuning. To overcome this issue, we present Okapi, the first system with instruction-tuned LLMs based on RLHF for multiple languages. Okapi introduces instruction and response-ranked data in 26 diverse languages to facilitate the experiments and development of future multilingual LLM research. We also present benchmark datasets to enable the evaluation of generative LLMs in multiple languages. Our experiments demonstrate the advantages of RLHF for multilingual instruction over SFT for different base models and datasets. Our framework with created resources, fine-tuned LLMs, interaction scripts are released at https://github.com/nlp-uoregon/Okapi. A demo video to show our framework can also be found at: https://youtu.be/QFV2fkPwvi0.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.28	Viet Lai, Chien Nguyen, Nghia Ngo, Thuat Nguyen, Franck Dernoncourt, Ryan Rossi, Thien Nguyen
MiniChain: A Small Library for Coding with Large Language Models	Programming augmented by large language models (LLMs) opens up many new application areas, but also requires care. LLMs are accurate enough, on average, to replace core functionality, yet make basic mistakes that demonstrate a lack of robustness. An ecosystem of prompting tools, from intelligent agents to new programming languages, have emerged with different solutions for patching LLMs with other tools. In this work, we introduce MiniChain, an opinionated tool for LLM augmented programming, with the design goals of ease-of-use of prototyping, transparency through automatic visualization, and a minimalistic approach to advanced features. The MiniChain library provides core primitives for coding LLM calls, separating out prompt templates, and capturing program structure. The library includes demo implementations of the main applications papers in the area, including chat-bots, code generation, retrieval-based question answering, and complex information extraction. The library is open-source and available at https://github.com/srush/MiniChain, with code demos available at https://srush-minichain.hf.space/, and video demo at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VszZ1VnO7sk.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.27	Alexander Rush

RobustQA: A Framework for Adversarial Text Generation Analysis on Question Answering Systems	Question answering (QA) systems have reached human-level accuracy; however, these systems are not robust enough and are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Recently, adversarial attacks have been widely investigated in text classification. However, there have been few research efforts on this topic in QA. In this article, we have modified the attack algorithms widely used in text classification to fit those algorithms for QA systems. We have evaluated the impact of various attack methods on QA systems at character, word, and sentence levels. Furthermore, we have developed a new framework, named RobustQA, as the first open-source toolkit for investigating textual adversarial attacks in QA systems. RobustQA consists of seven modules: Tokenizer, Victim Model, Goals, Metrics, Attacker, Attack Selector, and Evaluator. It currently supports six different attack algorithms. Furthermore, the framework simplifies the development of new attack algorithms in QA. The source code and documentation of RobustQA are available at https://github.com/mirbostani/RobustQA.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.24	Yasaman Boreshban, Seyed Morteza Mirbostani, Seyedeh Fatemeh Ahmadi, Gita Shojaee, Fatemeh Kamani, Gholamreza Ghassem-Sani, Seyed Abolghasem Mirroshandel
Kandinsky: An Improved Text-to-Image Synthesis with Image Prior and Latent Diffusion	Text-to-image generation is a significant domain in modern computer vision and achieved substantial improvements through the evolution of generative architectures. Among these, diffusion-based models demonstrated essential quality enhancements. These models generally split into two categories: pixel-level and latent-level approaches. We present Kandinsky – a novel exploration of latent diffusion architecture, combining the principles of image prior models with latent diffusion techniques. The image prior model, is trained separately to map CLIP text and image embeddings. Another distinct feature of the proposed model is the modified MoVQ implementation, which serves as the image autoencoder component. Overall the designed model contains 3.3B parameters. We also deployed a user-friendly demo system that supports diverse generative modes such as text-to-image generation, image fusion, text and image fusion, image variations generation and text-guided inpainting/outpainting. Additionally we released the source code and checkpoints for Kandinsky models. Experimental evaluations demonstrate FID score of 8.03 on the COCO-30K dataset, marking our model as the top open source performer in terms of measurable image generation quality.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.25	Anton Razzhigaev, Arseniy Shakhmatov, Anastasia Maltseva, Vladimir Arkhipkin, Igor Pavlov, Ilya Ryabov, Angelina Kuts, Alexander Panchenko, Andrey Kuznetsov, Denis Dimitrov
QACheck: A Demonstration System for Question-Guided Multi-Hop Fact-Checking	Fact-checking real-world claims often requires intricate, multi-step reasoning due to the absence of direct evidence to support or refute them. However, existing fact-checking systems often lack transparency in their decision-making, making it challenging for users to comprehend their reasoning process. To address this, we propose the Question-guided Multi-hop Fact-Checking (QACheck) system, which guides the model's reasoning process by asking a series of questions critical for verifying a claim. QACheck has five key modules: a claim verifier, a question generator, a question-answering module, a QA validator, and a reasoner. Users can input a claim into QACheck, which then predicts its veracity and provides a comprehensive report detailing its reasoning process, guided by a sequence of (question, answer) pairs. QACheck also provides the source of evidence supporting each question, fostering a transparent, explainable, and user-friendly fact-checking process.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.23	Liangming Pan, Xinyuan Lu, Min-Yen Kan, Preslav Nakov
SentAlign: Accurate and Scalable Sentence Alignment	We present SentAlign, an accurate sentence alignment tool designed to handle very large parallel document pairs. Given user-defined parameters, the alignment algorithm evaluates all possible alignment paths in fairly large documents of thousands of sentences and uses a divide-and-conquer approach to align documents containing tens of thousands of sentences. The scoring function is based on LaBSE bilingual sentence representations. SentAlign outperforms five other sentence alignment tools when evaluated on two different evaluation sets, German-French and English-Icelandic, and on a downstream machine translation task.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.22	Steinthor Steingrimsson, Hrafn Loftsson, Andy Way
MusicAgent: An AI Agent for Music Understanding and Generation with Large Language Models	AI-empowered music processing is a diverse feld that encompasses dozens of tasks, ranging from generation tasks (e.g., timbre synthesis) to comprehension tasks (e.g., music classifcation). For developers and amateurs, it is very diffcult to grasp all of these task to satisfy their requirements in music processing, especially considering the huge differences in the representations of music data and the model applicability across platforms among various tasks. Consequently, it is necessary to build a system to organize and integrate these tasks, and thus help practitioners to automatically analyze their demand and call suitable tools as solutions to fulfill their requirements. Inspired by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in task automation, we develop a system, named MusicAgent, which integrates numerous music-related tools and an autonomous workflow to address user requirements. More specifically, we build 1) toolset that collects tools from diverse sources, including Hugging Face, GitHub, and Web API, etc. 2) an autonomous workflow empowered by LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) to organize these tools and automatically decompose user requests into multiple sub-tasks and invoke corresponding music tools. The primary goal of this system is to free users from the intricacies of AI-music tools, enabling them to concentrate on the creative aspect. By granting users the freedom to effortlessly combine tools, the system offers a seamless and enriching music experience. The code is available on GitHub along with a brief instructional video.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.21	Dingyao Yu, Kaitao Song, Peiling Lu, Tianyu He, Xu Tan, Wei Ye, Shikun Zhang, Jiang Bian
Gentopia.AI: A Collaborative Platform for Tool-Augmented LLMs	Augmented Language Models (ALMs) empower large language models with the ability to use tools, transforming them into intelligent agents for real-world interactions. However, most existing frameworks for ALMs, to varying degrees, are deficient in the following critical features: flexible customization, collaborative democratization, and holistic evaluation. This paper proposes Gentopia, a lightweight and extensible framework for ALMs. Gentopia allows the flexible customization of agents through simple configurations, seamlessly integrating various language models, task formats, prompting modules, and plugins into a unified paradigm. Furthermore, we establish Gentpool, a public platform enabling the registration and sharing of user-customized agents. Agents registered in Gentpool are composable such that they can be assembled together for agent collaboration, advancing the democratization of artificial intelligence. To ensure high-quality agents, Gentbench, an integral component of Gentpool, is designed to thoroughly evaluate user-customized agents across diverse aspects such as safety, robustness, efficiency, etc. We release Gentopia on Github and will continuously move forward.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.20	Binfeng Xu, Xukun Liu, Hua Shen, Zeyu Han, Yuhan Li, Murong Yue, Zhiyuan Peng, Yuchen Liu, Ziyu Yao, Dongkuan Xu
Muted: Multilingual Targeted Offensive Speech Identification and Visualization	Offensive language such as hate, abuse, and profanity (HAP) occurs in various content on the web. While previous work has mostly dealt with sentence level annotations, there have been a few recent attempts to identify offensive spans as well. We build upon this work and introduce MUTED, a system to identify multilingual HAP content by displaying offensive arguments and their targets using heat maps to indicate their intensity. MUTED can leverage any transformer-based HAP-classification model and its attention mechanism out-of-the-box to identify toxic spans, without further fine-tuning. In addition, we use the spaCy library to identify the specific targets and arguments for the words predicted by the attention heatmaps.

CLEVA: Chinese Language Models EVAluation Platform	With the continuous emergence of Chinese Large Language Models (LLMs), how to evaluate a model's capabilities has become an increasingly significant issue. The absence of a comprehensive Chinese benchmark that thoroughly assesses a model's performance, the unstandardized and incomparable prompting procedure, and the prevalent risk of contamination pose major challenges in the current evaluation of Chinese LLMs. We present CLEVA, a user-friendly platform crafted to holistically evaluate Chinese LLMs. Our platform employs a standardized workflow to assess LLMs' performance across various dimensions, regularly updating a competitive leaderboard. To alleviate contamination, CLEVA curates a significant proportion of new data and develops a sampling strategy that guarantees a unique subset for each leaderboard round. Empowered by an easy-to-use interface that requires just a few mouse clicks and a model API, users can conduct a thorough evaluation with minimal coding. Large-scale experiments featuring 23 Chinese LLMs have validated CLEVA's efficacy.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.17	Yanyang Li, Jianqiao Zhao, Duo Zheng, Zi-Yuan Hu, Zhi Chen, Xiaohui Su, Yongfeng Huang, Shijia Huang, Dahua Lin, Michael Lyu, Liwei Wang
TP-Detector: Detecting Turning Points in the Engineering Process of Large-scale Projects	This paper introduces a novel task of detecting turning points in the engineering process of large-scale projects, wherein the turning points signify significant transitions occurring between phases. Given the complexities involving diverse critical events and limited comprehension in individual news reports, we approach the problem by treating the sequence of related news streams as a window with multiple instances. To capture the evolution of changes effectively, we adopt a deep Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework and employ the multiple instance ranking loss to discern the transition patterns exhibited in the turning point window. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach on the constructed dataset compared to baseline methods. We deployed the proposed mode and provided a demonstration video to illustrate its functionality. The code and dataset are available on GitHub.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.16	Qi Wu, WenHan Chao, Xian Zhou, Zhunchen Luo
DOPA METER – A Tool Suite for Metrical Document Profiling and Aggregation	We present DOPA METER, a tool suite for the metrical investigation of written language, that provides diagnostic means for its division into discourse categories, such as registers, genres, and style. The quantitative basis of our system are 120 metrics covering a wide range of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features relevant for language profiling.

Humanoid Agents: Platform for Simulating Human-like Generative Agents	Just as computational simulations of atoms, molecules and cells have shaped the way we study the sciences, true-to-life simulations of human-like agents can be valuable tools for studying human behavior. We propose Humanoid Agents, a system that guides Generative Agents to behave more like humans by introducing three elements of System 1 processing: Basic needs (e.g. hunger, health and energy), Emotion and Closeness in Relationships. Humanoid Agents are able to use these dynamic elements to adapt their daily activities and conversations with other agents, as supported with empirical experiments. Our system is designed to be extensible to various settings, three of which we demonstrate, as well as to other elements influencing human behavior (e.g. empathy, moral values and cultural background). Our platform also includes a Unity WebGL game interface for visualization and an interactive analytics dashboard to show agent statuses over time. Our platform is available on https://www.humanoidagents.com/ and code is on https://github.com/HumanoidAgents/HumanoidAgents	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.15	Zhilin Wang, Yu Ying Chiu, Yu Cheung Chiu

YATO: Yet Another deep learning based Text analysis Open toolkit	We introduce YATO, an open-source, easy-to-use toolkit for text analysis with deep learning. Different from existing heavily engineered toolkits and platforms, YATO is lightweight and user-friendly for researchers from cross-disciplinary areas. Designed in a hierarchical structure, YATO supports free combinations of three types of widely used features including 1) traditional neural networks (CNN, RNN, etc.); 2) pre-trained language models (BERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA, etc.); and 3) user-customized neural features via a simple configurable file.

FLEEK: Factual Error Detection and Correction with Evidence Retrieved from External Knowledge	Detecting factual errors of textual information, whether generated by large language models (LLM) or curated by humans, is crucial for making informed decisions. LLMs' inability to attribute their claims to external knowledge and their tendency to hallucinate makes it difficult to rely on their responses. Humans, too, are prone to factual errors in their writing. Since manual detection and correction of factual er- rors is labor-intensive, developing an automatic approach can greatly reduce human effort. We present a prototype tool that automatically extracts factual claims from text, gathers evidence from external knowledge sources, evaluates the factuality of each claim, and suggests revisions for identified errors using the collected evidence. Initial empirical evaluation on fact error detection (77-85% F1) shows the potential of our tool.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.10	Farima Fatahi Bayat, Kun Qian, Benjamin Han, Yisi Sang, Anton Belyy, Samira Khorshidi, Fei Wu, Ihab Ilyas, Yunyao Li
ConvLab-3: A Flexible Dialogue System Toolkit Based on a Unified Data Format	Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems function as digital assistants, guiding users through various tasks such as booking flights or finding restaurants. Existing toolkits for building TOD systems often fall short in delivering comprehensive arrays of data, model, and experimental environments with a user-friendly experience. We introduce ConvLab-3: a multifaceted dialogue system toolkit crafted to bridge this gap. Our unified data format simplifies the integration of diverse datasets and models, significantly reducing complexity and cost for studying generalization and transfer. Enhanced with robust reinforcement learning (RL) tools, featuring a streamlined training process, in-depth evaluation tools, and a selection of user simulators, ConvLab-3 supports the rapid development and evaluation of robust dialogue policies.

Sudowoodo: A Chinese Lyric Imitation System with Source Lyrics	"Lyrics generation is a well-known application in natural language generation research, with several previous studies focusing on generating accurate lyrics using precise control such as keywords, rhymes, etc. However, lyrics imitation, which involves writing new lyrics by imitating the style and content of the source lyrics, remains a challenging task due to the lack of a parallel corpus. In this paper, we introduce Sudowoodo, a Chinese lyrics imitation system that can generate new lyrics based on the text of source lyrics. To address the issue of lacking a parallel training corpus for lyrics imitation, we propose a novel framework to construct a parallel corpus based on a keyword-based lyrics model from source lyrics. Then the pairs (new lyrics, source lyrics) are used to train the lyrics imitation model. During the inference process, we utilize a post-processing module to filter and rank the generated lyrics, selecting the highest-quality ones. We incorporated audio information and aligned the lyrics with the audio to form the songs as a bonus. The human evaluation results show that our framework can perform better lyric imitation. Meanwhile, the Sudowoodo system and demo video of the system is available at Sudowoodo and <a href=""https://youtu.be/u5BBT%5C_j1L5M"" class=""acl-markup-url"">https://youtu.be/u5BBT\_j1L5M"	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.8	Yongzhu Chang, Rongsheng Zhang, Lin Jiang, Qihang Chen, Le Zhang, Jiashu Pu
Koala: An Index for Quantifying Overlaps with Pre-training Corpora	In very recent years more attention has been placed on probing the role of pre-training data in Large Language Models (LLMs) downstream behaviour. Despite the importance, there is no public tool that supports such analysis of pre-training corpora at large scale. To help research in this space, we launch Koala, a searchable index over large pre-training corpora using lossless compressed suffix arrays with highly efficient compression rate and search support. In its first release we index the public proportion of OPT 175B, GPT-3, GPT-Neo, GPT-Neo, LLaMA, BERT, ELECTRA, RoBERTA, XLNet pre-training corpora. Koala provides a framework to do forensic analysis on the current and future benchmarks as well as to assess the degree of memorization in the output from the LLMs. Koala is available for public use at https://koala-index.erc.monash.edu/.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.7	Thuy-Trang Vu, Xuanli He, Gholamreza Haffari, Ehsan Shareghi
H2O Open Ecosystem for State-of-the-art Large Language Models	Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a revolution in AI. However, they also pose many significant risks, such as the presence of biased, private, copyrighted or harmful text. For this reason we need open, transparent and safe solutions. We introduce a complete open-source ecosystem for developing and testing LLMs. The goal of this project is to boost open alternatives to closed-source approaches. We release h2oGPT, a family of fine-tuned LLMs from 7 to 70 Billion parameters. We also introduce H2O LLM Studio, a framework and no-code GUI designed for efficient fine-tuning, evaluation, and deployment of LLMs using the most recent state-of-the-art techniques.

VIST5: An Adaptive, Retrieval-Augmented Language Model for Visualization-oriented Dialog	The advent of large language models has brought about new ways of interacting with data intuitively via natural language. In recent years, a variety of visualization systems have explored the use of natural language to create and modify visualizations through visualization-oriented dialog. However, the majority of these systems rely on tailored dialog agents to analyze domain-specific data and operate domain-specific visualization tools and libraries. This is a major challenge when trying to transfer functionalities between dialog interfaces of different visualization applications. To address this issue, we propose VIST5, a visualization-oriented dialog system that focuses on easy adaptability to an application domain as well as easy transferability of language-controllable visualization library functions between applications. Its architecture is based on a retrieval-augmented T5 language model that leverages few-shot learning capabilities to enable a rapid adaptation of the system.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.5	Henrik Voigt, Nuno Carvalhais, Monique Meuschke, Markus Reichstein, Sina Zarrie, Kai Lawonn
RaLLe: A Framework for Developing and Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models	Retrieval-augmented large language models (R-LLMs) combine pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with information retrieval systems to improve the accuracy of factual question-answering. However, current libraries for building R-LLMs provide high-level abstractions without sufficient transparency for evaluating and optimizing prompts within specific inference processes such as retrieval and generation. To address this gap, we present RaLLe, an open-source framework designed to facilitate the development, evaluation, and optimization of R-LLMs for knowledge-intensive tasks. With RaLLe, developers can easily develop and evaluate R-LLMs, improving hand-crafted prompts, assessing individual inference processes, and objectively measuring overall system performance quantitatively. By leveraging these features, developers can enhance the performance and accuracy of their R-LLMs in knowledge-intensive generation tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.4	Yasuto Hoshi, Daisuke Miyashita, Youyang Ng, Kento Tatsuno, Yasuhiro Morioka, Osamu Torii, Jun Deguchi
CHATREPORT: Democratizing Sustainability Disclosure Analysis through LLM-based Tools	"In the face of climate change, are companies really taking substantial steps toward more sustainable operations? A comprehensive answer lies in the dense, information-rich landscape of corporate sustainability reports. However, the sheer volume and complexity of these reports make human analysis very costly. Therefore, only a few entities worldwide have the resources to analyze these reports at scale, which leads to a lack of transparency in sustainability reporting. Empowering stakeholders with LLM-based automatic analysis tools can be a promising way to democratize sustainability report analysis. However, developing such tools is challenging due to (1) the hallucination of LLMs and (2) the inefficiency of bringing domain experts into the AI development loop. In this paper, we introduce ChatReport, a novel LLM-based system to automate the analysis of corporate sustainability reports, addressing existing challenges by (1) making the answers traceable to reduce the harm of hallucination and (2) actively involving domain experts in the development loop. We make our methodology, annotated datasets, and generated analyses of 1015 reports publicly available.

End-to-End Evaluation for Low-Latency Simultaneous Speech Translation	The challenge of low-latency speech translation has recently draw significant interest in the research community as shown by several publications and shared tasks. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate these different approaches in realistic scenarios. However, currently only specific aspects of the systems are evaluated and often it is not possible to compare different approaches. In this work, we propose the first framework to perform and evaluate the various aspects of low-latency speech translation under realistic conditions. The evaluation is carried out in an end-to-end fashion. This includes the segmentation of the audio as well as the run-time of the different components. Secondly, we compare different approaches to low-latency speech translation using this framework. We evaluate models with the option to revise the output as well as methods with fixed output. Furthermore, we directly compare state-of-the-art cascaded as well as end-to-end systems. Finally, the framework allows to automatically evaluate the translation quality as well as latency and also provides a web interface to show the low-latency model outputs to the user.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.2	Christian Huber, Tu Anh Dinh, Carlos Mullov, Ngoc-Quan Pham, Thai Binh Nguyen, Fabian Retkowski, Stefan Constantin, Enes Ugan, Danni Liu, Zhaolin Li, Sai Koneru, Jan Niehues, Alexander Waibel
Fabricator: An Open Source Toolkit for Generating Labeled Training Data with Teacher LLMs	"Most NLP tasks are modeled as supervised learning and thus require labeled training data to train effective models. However, manually producing such data at sufficient quality and quantity is known to be costly and time-intensive. Current research addresses this bottleneck by exploring a novel paradigm called zero-shot learning via dataset generation. Here, a powerful LLM is prompted with a task description to generate labeled data that can be used to train a downstream NLP model. For instance, an LLM might be prompted to ""generate 500 movie reviews with positive overall sentiment, and another 500 with negative sentiment."" The generated data could then be used to train a binary sentiment classifier, effectively leveraging an LLM as a teacher to a smaller student model. With this demo, we introduce Fabricator, an open-source Python toolkit for dataset generation. Fabricator implements common dataset generation workflows, supports a wide range of downstream NLP tasks (such as text classification, question answering, and entity recognition), and is integrated with well-known libraries to facilitate quick experimentation. With Fabricator, we aim to support researchers in conducting reproducible dataset generation experiments using LLMs and help practitioners apply this approach to train models for downstream tasks."	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.1	Jonas Golde, Patrick Haller, Felix Hamborg, Julian Risch, Alan Akbik
DELPHI: Data for Evaluating LLMs’ Performance in Handling Controversial Issues	Controversy is a reflection of our zeitgeist, and an important aspect to any discourse. The rise of large language models (LLMs) as conversational systems has increased public reliance on these systems for answers to their various questions. Consequently, it is crucial to systematically examine how these models respond to questions that pertaining to ongoing debates. However, few such datasets exist in providing human-annotated labels reflecting the contemporary discussions. To foster research in this area, we propose a novel construction of a controversial questions dataset, expanding upon the publicly released Quora Question Pairs Dataset. This dataset presents challenges concerning knowledge recency, safety, fairness, and bias. We evaluate different LLMs using a subset of this dataset, illuminating how they handle controversial issues and the stances they adopt. This research ultimately contributes to our understanding of LLMs' interaction with controversial issues, paving the way for improvements in their comprehension and handling of complex societal debates.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.76	David Sun, Artem Abzaliev, Hadas Kotek, Christopher Klein, Zidi Xiu, Jason Williams
Graph Meets LLM: A Novel Approach to Collaborative Filtering for Robust Conversational Understanding	"A Personalized Query Rewriting system strives to minimize defective queries to ensure robust conversational functionality by considering individual user behavior and preferences. It's designed as a search-based system, maintaining a user index of past successful interactions with the conversational AI. However, this method faces challenges with unseen interactions, which refers to novel user interactions not covered by the user's historical index. This paper introduces our Collaborative Query Rewriting approach, which utilizes underlying topological information to assist in rewriting defective queries arising from unseen user interactions. This approach begins by constructing a ""User Feedback Interaction Graph"" (FIG) using historical user-entity interactions. Subsequently, we traverse through the graph edges to establish an enhanced user index, referred to as the ""collaborative user index"". This paper then further explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in conjunction with graph traversal, leading to a significant increase in index coverage for unseen interactions. The effectiveness of our proposed approach has been proven through experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset and online A/B experiments."	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.75	Zheng Chen, Ziyan Jiang, Fan Yang, Eunah Cho, Xing Fan, Xiaojiang Huang, Yanbin Lu, Aram Galstyan
Batch Prompting: Efficient Inference with Large Language Model APIs	Performing inference on large volumes of samples with large language models (LLMs) can be computationally and financially costly in industry and real-world use. We propose batch prompting, a simple yet effective prompting approach that enables the LLM to run inference in batches, instead of one sample at a time. Our method reduces both token and time costs while retaining downstream performance. We theoretically demonstrate that under a few-shot in-context learning setting, the inference costs decrease almost inverse linearly with the number of samples in each batch. We extensively validate the effectiveness of batch prompting on ten datasets across commonsense QA, arithmetic reasoning, and NLI/NLU: batch prompting significantly (up to 5× with six samples in batch) reduces the LLM (Codex) inference token and time costs while achieving better or comparable performance. For state-of-the-art Chat-based LLMs, e.g., GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, we show the benefits of batch prompting also hold. Further analysis shows that the number of samples in each batch and the complexity of tasks affect its performance. Moreover, batch prompting can be applied across different reasoning methods using LLMs. Our code is released at the site https://github.com/xlang-ai/batch-prompting.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.74	Zhoujun Cheng, Jungo Kasai, Tao Yu
On Sample-Efficient Code Generation	Large language models often struggle to predict runtime behavior in code generation tasks, leading to a reliance on rejection sampling (best-of-n) to generate multiple code snippets then select the best. Our distinction is reducing sampling costs, without compromising generation quality. We introduce EFFICODE, a novel framework that prioritizes sampling on test problems that models can solve. We show how EFFICODE estimates solvability to optimize computational costs during multiple sampling. Based on empirical evidence, EFFICODE consistently demonstrates reduced sampling budgets while maintaining comparable code generation performance, especially when problems are challenging. In addition, utilizing EFFICODE to rank sampled code snippets also shows its effectiveness in answer code selection for reducing temporal costs, by not requiring any execution or test case generation.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.73	Hojae Han, Yu Jin Kim, Byoungjip Kim, Youngwon Lee, Kyungjae Lee, Kyungmin Lee, Moontae Lee, Kyunghoon Bae, Seung-won Hwang
Adaptive Hyper-parameter Learning for Deep Semantic Retrieval	Deep semantic retrieval has achieved remarkable success in online E-commerce applications. The majority of methods aim to distinguish positive items and negative items for each query by utilizing margin loss or softmax loss. Despite their decent performance, these methods are highly sensitive to hyper-parameters, i.e., margin and temperature 𝜏 , which measure the similarity of negative pairs and affect the distribution of items in metric space. How to design and choose adaptively parameters for different pairs is still an open challenge. Recently several methods have attempted to alleviate the above problem by learning each parameter through trainable/statistical methods in the recommendation. We argue that those are not suitable for retrieval scenarios, due to the agnosticism and diversity of the queries. To fully overcome this limitation, we propose a novel adaptive metric learning method that designs a simple and universal hyper-parameter-free learning method to improve the performance of retrieval. Specifically, we first propose a method that adaptive obtains the hyper-parameters by relying on the batch similarity without fixed or extra-trainable hyper-parameters. Subsequently, we adopt a symmetric metric learning method to mitigate model collapse issues. Furthermore, the proposed method is general and sheds a highlight on other fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method significantly outperforms previous methods on a real-world dataset, highlighting the superiority and effectiveness of our method. This method has been successfully deployed on an online E-commerce search platform and brought substantial economic benefits.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.72	Mingming Li, Chunyuan Yuan, Huimu Wang, Peng Wang, Jingwei Zhuo, Binbin Wang, Lin Liu, Sulong Xu
An Integrated Search System for Korea Weather Data	We introduce WeatherSearch, an integrated search system deployed at the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA). WeatherSearch enables users to retrieve all the relevant data for weather forecasting from a massive weather database with simple natural language queries. We carefully design and conduct multiple expert surveys and interviews for template creation and apply data augmentation techniques including template filling to collect 4 million data points with minimal human labors. We then finetune mT5 on the collected dataset and achieve an average MRR of 0.66 and an average Recall of 0.82. We also discuss weather-data-specific characteristics that should be taken into account for creating such a system.

ViGPTQA - State-of-the-Art LLMs for Vietnamese Question Answering: System Overview, Core Models Training, and Evaluations	Large language models (LLMs) and their applications in low-resource languages (such as in Vietnamese) are limited due to lack of training data and benchmarking datasets. This paper introduces a practical real-world implementation of a question answering system for Vietnamese, called ViGPTQA, leveraging the power of LLM. Since there is no effective LLM in Vietnamese to date, we also propose, evaluate, and open-source an instruction-tuned LLM for Vietnamese, named ViGPT. ViGPT demonstrates exceptional performances, especially on real-world scenarios. We curate a new set of benchmark datasets that encompass both AI and human-generated data, providing a comprehensive evaluation framework for Vietnamese LLMs. By achieving state-of-the-art results and approaching other multilingual LLMs, our instruction-tuned LLM underscores the need for dedicated Vietnamese-specific LLMs. Our open-source model supports customized and privacy-fulfilled Vietnamese language processing systems.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.70	Minh Thuan Nguyen, Khanh Tung Tran, Nhu Van Nguyen, Xuan-Son Vu
Harnessing LLMs for Temporal Data - A Study on Explainable Financial Time Series Forecasting	Applying machine learning to financial time series has been an active area of industrial research enabling innovation in market insights, risk management, strategic decision-making, and policy formation. This paper explores the novel use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for explainable financial time series forecasting, addressing challenges in cross-sequence reasoning, multi-modal data integration, and result interpretation that are inherent in traditional approaches. Focusing on NASDAQ-100 stocks, we utilize public historical stock data, company metadata, and economic/financial news. Our experiments employ GPT-4 for zero-shot/few-shot inference and Open LLaMA for instruction-based fine-tuning. The study demonstrates LLMs' ability to generate well-reasoned decisions by leveraging cross-sequence information and extracting insights from text and price time series. We show that our LLM-based approach outperforms classic ARMA-GARCH and gradient-boosting tree models. Furthermore, fine-tuned public LLMs, such as Open-LLaMA, can generate reasonable and explainable forecasts, although they underperform compared to GPT-4.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.69	Xinli Yu, Zheng Chen, Yanbin Lu
Too much of product information : Don’t worry, let’s look for evidence!	Product question answering (PQA) aims to provide an instant response to customer questions posted on shopping message boards, social media, brand websites and retail stores. In this paper, we propose a distantly supervised solution to answer customer questions by using product information. Auto-answering questions using product information poses two main challenges:(i) labelled data is not readily available (ii)lengthy product information requires attending to various parts of the text to answer the question. To this end, we first propose a novel distant supervision based NLI model to prepare training data without any manual efforts. To deal with lengthy context, we factorize answer generation into two sub-problems. First, given product information, model extracts evidence spans relevant to question. Then, model leverages evidence spans to generate answer. Further, we propose two novelties in fine-tuning approach: (i) First, we jointly fine-tune model for both the tasks in end-to-end manner and showcase that it outperforms standard multi-task fine-tuning. (ii) Next, we introduce an auxiliary contrastive loss for evidence extraction. We show that combination of these two ideas achieves an absolute improvement of 6% in accuracy (human evaluation) over baselines.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.68	Aryan Jain, Jitenkumar Rana, Chetan Aggarwal
Relevance-assisted Generation for Robust Zero-shot Retrieval	Zero-shot retrieval tasks such as the BEIR benchmark reveal out-of-domain generalization as a key weakness of high-performance dense retrievers. As a solution, domain adaptation for dense retrievers has been actively studied. A notable approach is synthesizing domain-specific data, by generating pseudo queries (PQ), for fine-tuning with domain-specific relevance between PQ and documents. Our contribution is showing that key biases can cause sampled PQ to be irrelevant, negatively contributing to generalization. We propose to preempt their generation, by dividing the generation into simpler subtasks, of generating relevance explanations and guiding the generation to avoid negative generalization. Experiment results show that our proposed approach is more robust to domain shifts, validated on challenging BEIR zero-shot retrieval tasks.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.67	Jihyuk Kim, Minsoo Kim, Joonsuk Park, Seung-won Hwang
DocumentNet: Bridging the Data Gap in Document Pre-training	Document understanding tasks, in particular, Visually-rich Document Entity Retrieval (VDER), have gained significant attention in recent years thanks to their broad applications in enterprise AI. However, publicly available data have been scarce for these tasks due to strict privacy constraints and high annotation costs. To make things worse, the non-overlapping entity spaces from different datasets hinder the knowledge transfer between document types. In this paper, we propose a method to collect massive-scale and weakly labeled data from the web to benefit the training of VDER models. The collected dataset, named DocumentNet, does not depend on specific document types or entity sets, making it universally applicable to all VDER tasks. The current DocumentNet consists of 30M documents spanning nearly 400 document types organized in a four-level ontology. Experiments on a set of broadly adopted VDER tasks show significant improvements when DocumentNet is incorporated into the pre-training for both classic and few-shot learning settings. With the recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), DocumentNet provides a large data source to extend their multimodal capabilities for VDER.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.66	Lijun Yu, Jin Miao, Xiaoyu Sun, Jiayi Chen, Alexander Hauptmann, Hanjun Dai, Wei Wei

DUBLIN is pretrained on a large corpus of document images with novel tasks that enhance its visual and linguistic abilities. We evaluate DUBLIN on various benchmarks and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on extractive tasks such as DocVQA, InfoVQA, AI2D, OCR-VQA, RefExp, and CORD, as well as strong performance on abstraction datasets such as VisualMRC and text captioning. Our model demonstrates the potential of OCR-free document processing and opens new avenues for applications and research.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.65	Kriti Aggarwal, Aditi Khandelwal, Kumar Tanmay, Owais Khan Mohammed, Qiang Liu, Monojit Choudhury, Hardik Chauhan, Subhojit Som, Vishrav Chaudhary, Saurabh Tiwary
InstructPTS: Instruction-Tuning LLMs for Product Title Summarization	E-commerce product catalogs contain billions of items. Most products have lengthy titles, as sellers pack them with product attributes to improve retrieval, and highlight key product aspects. This results in a gap between such unnatural products titles, and how customers refer to them. It also limits how e-commerce stores can use these seller-provided titles for recommendation, QA, or review summarization. Inspired by recent work on instruction-tuned LLMs, we present InstructPTS, a controllable approach for the task of Product Title Summarization (PTS). Trained using a novel instruction fine-tuning strategy, our approach is able to summarize product titles according to various criteria (e.g. number of words in a summary, inclusion of specific phrases, etc.). Extensive evaluation on a real-world e-commerce catalog shows that compared to simple fine-tuning of LLMs, our proposed approach can generate more accurate product name summaries, with an improvement of over 14 and 8 BLEU and ROUGE points, respectively.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.63	Besnik Fetahu, Zhiyu Chen, Oleg Rokhlenko, Shervin Malmasi
LLM4Vis: Explainable Visualization Recommendation using ChatGPT	Data visualization is a powerful tool for exploring and communicating insights in various domains. To automate visualization choice for datasets, a task known as visualization recommendation has been proposed. Various machine-learning-based approaches have been developed for this purpose, but they often require a large corpus of dataset-visualization pairs for training and lack natural explanations for their results. To address this research gap, we propose LLM4Vis, a novel ChatGPT-based prompting approach to perform visualization recommendation and return human-like explanations using very few demonstration examples. Our approach involves feature description, demonstration example selection, explanation generation, demonstration example construction, and inference steps. To obtain demonstration examples with high-quality explanations, we propose a new explanation generation bootstrapping to iteratively refine generated explanations by considering the previous generation and template-based hint. Evaluations on the VizML dataset show that LLM4Vis outperforms or performs similarly to supervised learning models like Random Forest, Decision Tree, and MLP, in both few-shot and zero-shot settings. The qualitative evaluation also shows the effectiveness of explanations generated by LLM4Vis.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.64	Lei Wang, Songheng Zhang, Yun Wang, Ee-Peng Lim, Yong Wang
Self-Criticism: Aligning Large Language Models with their Understanding of Helpfulness, Honesty, and Harmlessness	"Recently, there has been a notable surge in the significance of large language models (LLMs) that engage in conversational-style interactions, such as ChatGPT and Claude, as they contribute significantly to the progress of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Typically, these models undergo a two-phase fine-tuning process: instruction fine-tuning (IF) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). These methods aim to align the LLMs to be helpful, honest, and harmless (HHH). However, RLHF, which incorporates independent reward models trained on high-quality human feedback datasets, incurs high costs in terms of hardware resources and human efforts. Therefore, we explore the possibility of aligning LLMs with their own understanding of HHH through IF and in-context learning (ICL). In this study, we propose a novel framework called Self-Criticism, which allows LLMs to align themselves with HHH based on the definition they learned from a large-scale text corpus. We begin by employing IF on a given instruction set and learning HHH discrimination through few-shot ICL. Subsequently, the LLMs evaluate their own generated responses and learn to produce ""better"" responses based on self-judgment. Finally, the model is retrained based on the self-generated responses to distill the whole process. By analyzing our proposed method, we also find interesting connections between Self-Criticism and goal-conditioned reinforcement learning, and pseudo-labeling. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves nearly identical performance to RLHF in terms of both human evaluation and evaluation by other LLMs, with only a minimal alignment tax."	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.62	Xiaoyu Tan, Shaojie Shi, Xihe Qiu, Chao Qu, Zhenting Qi, Yinghui Xu, Yuan Qi
STEER: Semantic Turn Extension-Expansion Recognition for Voice Assistants	In the context of a voice assistant system, steering refers to the phenomenon in which a user issues a follow-up command attempting to direct or clarify a previous turn. We propose STEER, a steering detection model that predicts whether a follow-up turn is a user's attempt to steer the previous command. Constructing a training dataset for steering use cases poses challenges due to the cold-start problem. To overcome this, we developed heuristic rules to sample opt-in usage data, approximating positive and negative samples without any annotation. Our experimental results show promising performance in identifying steering intent, with over 95% accuracy on our sampled data. Moreover, STEER, in conjunction with our sampling strategy, aligns effectively with real-world steering scenarios, as evidenced by its strong zero-shot performance on a human-graded evaluation set. In addition to relying solely on user transcripts as input, we introduce STEER+, an enhanced version of the model. STEER+ utilizes a semantic parse tree to provide more context on out-of-vocabulary words, such as named entities that often occur at the sentence boundary. This further improves model performance, reducing error rate in domains where entities frequently appear, such as messaging. Lastly, we present a data analysis that highlights the improvement in user experience when voice assistants support steering use cases.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.61	Leon Zhang, Jiarui Lu, Joel Ruben Antony Moniz, Aditya Kulkarni, Dhivya Piraviperumal, Tien Dung Tran, Nick Tzou, Hong Yu
Retrieve and Copy: Scaling ASR Personalization to Large Catalogs	"Personalization of automatic speech recognition (ASR) models is a widely studied topic because of its many practical applications. Most recently, attention-based contextual biasing techniques are used to improve the recognition of rare words and/or domain specific entities. However, due to performance constraints, the biasing is often limited to a few thousand entities, restricting real-world usability. To address this, we first propose a ""Retrieve and Copy"" mechanism to improve latency while retaining the accuracy even when scaled to a large catalog. We also propose a training strategy to overcome the degradation in recall at such scale due to an increased number of confusing entities. Overall, our approach achieves up to 6% more Word Error Rate reduction (WERR) and 3.6% absolute improvement in F1 when compared to a strong baseline. Our method also allows for large catalog sizes of up to 20K without significantly affecting WER and F1-scores, while achieving at least 20% inference speedup per acoustic frame."	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.60	Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi, Devang Kulshreshtha, Saket Dingliwal, Srikanth Ronanki, Sravan Bodapati
JarviX: A LLM No code Platform for Tabular Data Analysis and Optimization	In this study, we introduce JarviX, a sophisticated data analytics framework. JarviX is designed to employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate an automated guide and execute high-precision data analyzes on tabular datasets. This framework emphasizes the significance of varying column types, capitalizing on state-of-the-art LLMs to generate concise data insight summaries, propose relevant analysis inquiries, visualize data effectively, and provide comprehensive explanations for results drawn from an extensive data analysis pipeline. Moreover, JarviX incorporates an automated machine learning (AutoML) pipeline for predictive modeling. This integration forms a comprehensive and automated optimization cycle, which proves particularly advantageous for optimizing machine configuration. The efficacy and adaptability of JarviX are substantiated through a series of practical use case studies.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.59	Shang-Ching Liu, ShengKun Wang, Tsungyao Chang, Wenqi Lin, Chung-Wei Hsiung, Yi-Chen Hsieh, Yu-Ping Cheng, Sian-Hong Luo, Jianwei Zhang
Multi-word Tokenization for Sequence Compression	Large Language Models have proven highly successful at modelling a variety of tasks. However, this comes at a steep computational cost that hinders wider industrial uptake. In this paper, we present MWT: a Multi-Word Tokenizer that goes beyond word boundaries by representing frequent multi-word expressions as single tokens. MWTs produce a more compact and efficient tokenization that yields two benefits: (1) Increase in performance due to a greater coverage of input data given a fixed sequence length budget; (2) Faster and lighter inference due to the ability to reduce the sequence length with negligible drops in performance. Our results show that MWT is more robust across shorter sequence lengths, thus allowing for major speedups via early sequence truncation.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.58	Leonidas Gee, Leonardo Rigutini, Marco Ernandes, Andrea Zugarini
BUSTER: a “BUSiness Transaction Entity Recognition” dataset	Albeit Natural Language Processing has seen major breakthroughs in the last few years, transferring such advances into real-world business cases can be challenging. One of the reasons resides in the displacement between popular benchmarks and actual data. Lack of supervision, unbalanced classes, noisy data and long documents often affect real problems in vertical domains such as finance, law and health. To support industry-oriented research, we present BUSTER, a BUSiness Transaction Entity Recognition dataset. The dataset consists of 3779 manually annotated documents on financial transactions. We establish several baselines exploiting both general-purpose and domain-specific language models. The best performing model is also used to automatically annotate 6196 documents, which we release as an additional silver corpus to BUSTER.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.57	Andrea Zugarini, Andrew Zamai, Marco Ernandes, Leonardo Rigutini
CarExpert: Leveraging Large Language Models for In-Car Conversational Question Answering	Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance by following natural language instructions without fine-tuning them on domain-specific tasks and data. However, leveraging LLMs for domain-specific question answering suffers from severe limitations. The generated answer tends to hallucinate due to the training data collection time (when using off-the-shelf), complex user utterance and wrong retrieval (in retrieval-augmented generation). Furthermore, due to the lack of awareness about the domain and expected output, such LLMs may generate unexpected and unsafe answers that are not tailored to the target domain. In this paper, we propose CarExpert, an in-car retrieval-augmented conversational question-answering system leveraging LLMs for different tasks. Specifically, CarExpert employs LLMs to control the input, provide domain-specific documents to the extractive and generative answering components, and controls the output to ensure safe and domain-specific answers. A comprehensive empirical evaluation exhibits that CarExpert outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs in generating natural, safe and car-specific answers.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.56	Md Rashad Al Hasan Rony, Christian Suess, Sinchana Ramakanth Bhat, Viju Sudhi, Julia Schneider, Maximilian Vogel, Roman Teucher, Ken Friedl, Soumya Sahoo
E2E Spoken Entity Extraction for Virtual Agents	In human-computer conversations, extracting entities such as names, street addresses and email addresses from speech is a challenging task. In this paper, we study the impact of fine-tuning pre-trained speech encoders on extracting spoken entities in human-readable form directly from speech without the need for text transcription. We illustrate that such a direct approach optimizes the encoder to transcribe only the entity relevant portions of speech ignoring the superfluous portions such as carrier phrases, or spell name entities. In the context of dialog from an enterprise virtual agent, we demonstrate that the 1-step approach outperforms the typical 2-step approach which first generates lexical transcriptions followed by text-based entity extraction for identifying spoken entities.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.54	Karan Singla, Yeon-Jun Kim, Srinivas Bangalore
Generative Models for Product Attribute Extraction	Product attribute extraction is an emerging field in information extraction and e-commerce, with applications including knowledge base construction, product recommendation, and enhancing customer experiences. In this work, we explore the use of generative models for product attribute extraction. We analyze their utility with hard and soft prompting methods, and demonstrate their ability to generate implicit attribute values, which state-of-the-art sequence tagging models are unable to extract. We perform a wide range of experiments on Amazon and MAVE product attribute datasets, and are the first to present results on multilingual attribute extraction. Our results show that generative models can outperform state- of-the-art tagging models for explicit product attribute extraction while having greater data efficiency, that they have the unique ability to perform implicit attribute extraction, and that in certain settings large language models can perform competitively with finetuned models with as little as two in-context examples.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.55	Ansel Blume, Nasser Zalmout, Heng Ji, Xian Li
InsightNet : Structured Insight Mining from Customer Feedback	We propose InsightNet, a novel approach for the automated extraction of structured insights from customer reviews. Our end-to-end machine learning framework is designed to overcome the limitations of current solutions, including the absence of structure for identified topics, non-standard aspect names, and lack of abundant training data. The proposed solution builds a semi-supervised multi-level taxonomy from raw reviews, a semantic similarity heuristic approach to generate labelled data and employs a multi-task insight extraction architecture by fine-tuning an LLM. InsightNet identifies granular actionable topics with customer sentiments and verbatim for each topic. Evaluations on real-world customer review data show that InsightNet performs better than existing solutions in terms of structure, hierarchy and completeness. We empirically demonstrate that InsightNet outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in multi-label topic classification, achieving an F1 score of 0.85, which is an improvement of 11% F1-score over the previous best results. Additionally, InsightNet generalises well for unseen aspects and suggests new topics to be added to the taxonomy.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.53	Sandeep Sricharan Mukku, Manan Soni, Chetan Aggarwal, Jitenkumar Rana, Promod Yenigalla, Rashmi Patange, Shyam Mohan
Investigating the Role and Impact of Disfluency on Summarization	Contact centers handle both chat and voice calls for the same domain. As part of their workflow, it is a standard practice to summarize the conversations once they conclude. A significant distinction between chat and voice communication lies in the presence of disfluencies in voice calls, such as repetitions, restarts, and replacements. These disfluencies are generally considered noise for downstream natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. While a separate summarization model for voice calls can be trained in addition to chat specific model for the same domain, it requires manual annotations for both the channels and adds complexity arising due to maintaining two models. Therefore, it's crucial to investigate if a model trained on fluent data can handle disfluent data effectively. While previous research explored impact of disfluency on question-answering and intent detection, its influence on summarization is inadequately studied. Our experiments reveal up to 6.99-point degradation in Rouge-L score, along with reduced fluency, consistency, and relevance when a fluent-trained model handles disfluent data. Replacement disfluencies have the highest negative impact. To mitigate this, we examine Fused-Fine Tuning by training the model with a combination of fluent and disfluent data, resulting in improved performance on both public and real-life datasets. Our work highlights the significance of incorporating disfluency in training summarization models and its advantages in an industrial setting.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.52	Varun Nathan, Ayush Kumar, Jithendra Vepa
VKIE: The Application of Key Information Extraction on Video Text	Extracting structured information from videos is critical for numerous downstream applications in the industry. In this paper, we define a significant task of extracting hierarchical key information from visual texts on videos. To fulfill this task, we decouple it into four subtasks and introduce two implementation solutions called PipVKIE and UniVKIE. PipVKIE sequentially completes the four subtasks in continuous stages, while UniVKIE is improved by unifying all the subtasks into one backbone. Both PipVKIE and UniVKIE leverage multimodal information from vision, text, and coordinates for feature representation. Extensive experiments on one well-defined dataset demonstrate that our solutions can achieve remarkable performance and efficient inference speed.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.51	Siyu An, Ye Liu, Haoyuan Peng, Di Yin
An Auxiliary Task Boosted Multi-task Learning Method for Service Account Retrieval with Limited Human Annotation	Service accounts, including organizations' official accounts and mini-programs, provide various convenient services for users, and have become crucial components of a number of applications. Therefore, retrieving service accounts quickly and accurately is vital. However, this task suffers from the problem of limited human annotation, i.e., manually assessing account functionality and assigning ratings based on user experience is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. To this end, this paper proposes a novel approach, the Auxiliary task Boosted Multi-Task Learning method (AuxBoost-MTL). Specifically, the proposed method introduces multiple auxiliary tasks, which is able to utilized the log data from our application as supervision, and enhance the performance of the main task, service account retrieval. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hierarchical Fusion Module (AHF module) into our approach. This module is designed to adaptively perform hierarchical fusion of embeddings from auxiliary tasks into the main task, thereby enhancing the model efficacy. Experiments on two real-world industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.50	Yuanzhou Yao, Zhao Zhang, Kaijia Yang, Huasheng Liang, Qiang Yan, Yongjun Xu
Towards Safer Operations: An Expert-involved Dataset of High-Pressure Gas Incidents for Preventing Future Failures	This paper introduces a new IncidentAI dataset for safety prevention. Different from prior corpora that usually contain a single task, our dataset comprises three tasks: named entity recognition, cause-effect extraction, and information retrieval. The dataset is annotated by domain experts who have at least six years of practical experience as high-pressure gas conservation managers. We validate the contribution of the dataset in the scenario of safety prevention. Preliminary results on the three tasks show that NLP techniques are beneficial for analyzing incident reports to prevent future failures. The dataset facilitates future research in NLP and incident management communities.

Automatic Marketing Theme and Commodity Construction System for E-commerce	When consumers' shopping needs are concentrated, they are more interested in the collection of commodities under the specific marketing theme. Therefore, mining marketing themes and their commodities collections can help customers save shopping costs and improve user clicks and purchases for recommendation system. However, the current system invites experts to write marketing themes and select the relevant commodities, which suffer from difficulty in mass production, poor timeliness and low online indicators. Therefore, we propose a automatic marketing theme and commodity construction system, which can not only generate popular marketing themes and select the relevant commodities automatically, but also improve the theme online effectiveness in the recommendation system. Specifically, we firstly utilize the pretrained language model to generate the marketing themes. And then, we utilize the theme-commodity consistency module to select the relevant commodities for the above generative theme. What's more, we also build the indicator simulator to evaluate the effectiveness of the above generative theme. When the indicator is lower, the above selective commodities will be input into the theme-rewriter module to generate more efficient marketing themes. Finally, we utilize the human screening to control the system quality. Both the offline experiments and online A/B test demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed system compared with state-of-the-art methods.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.48	Zhiping Wang, Peng Lin, Hainan Zhang, Hongshen Chen, Tianhao Li, Zhuoye Ding, Sulong Xu, Jinghe Hu
Automatic Linking of Judgements to UK Supreme Court Hearings	One the most important archived legal material in the UK is the Supreme Court published judgements and video recordings of court sittings for the decided cases. The impact of Supreme Court published material extends far beyond the parties involved in any given case as it provides landmark rulings on arguable points of law of the greatest public and constitutional importance. However, the recordings of a case are usually very long which makes it both time and effort consuming for legal professionals to study the critical arguments in the legal deliberations. In this research, we summarise the second part of a combined research-industrial project for building an automated tool designed specifically to link segments in the text judgement to semantically relevant timespans in the videos of the hearings. The tool is employed as a User-Interface (UI) platform that provides a better access to justice by bookmarking the timespans in the videos which contributed to the final judgement of the case. We explain how we employ AI generative technology to retrieve the relevant links and show that the customisation of the GPT text embeddings to our dataset achieves the best accuracy for our automatic linking system.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.47	Hadeel Saadany, Constantin Orasan
Welcome to the Real World: Efficient, Incremental and Scalable Key Point Analysis	Key Point Analysis (KPA) is an emerging summarization framework, which extracts the main points from a collection of opinions, and quantifies their prevalence. It has been successfully applied to diverse types of data, including arguments, user reviews and survey responses. Despite the growing academic interest in KPA, little attention has been given to the practical challenges of implementing a KPA system in production. This work presents a deployed KPA system, which regularly serves multiple teams in our organization. We discuss the main challenges we faced while building a real-world KPA system, as well as the architecture and algorithmic improvements we developed to address these challenges. Specifically, we focus on efficient matching of sentences to key points, incremental processing, scalability and resiliency. The value of our contributions is demonstrated in an extensive set of experiments, over five existing and novel datasets. Finally, we describe several use cases of the deployed system, which illustrate its practical value.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.46	Lilach Eden, Yoav Kantor, Matan Orbach, Yoav Katz, Noam Slonim, Roy Bar-Haim
PILLOW: Enhancing Efficient Instruction Fine-tuning via Prompt Matching	Instruction fine-tuning has conventionally been employed to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to a variety of diverse tasks. Nonetheless, this technique often necessitates substantial computational resources, making it impractical for deployment by individuals or small-scale entities. Recently, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a promising alternative, offering tuning capabilities with reduced resource overhead. However, attaining satisfactory performance through the fine-tuning of LoRA is a non-trivial challenge. In this paper, we propose PILLOW, which aims to improve LoRA's performance by leveraging LLM's in-context learning capability through prompt matching via reinforcement learning in resource-constrained environments. Specifically, PILLOW incorporates a matching network that selects prompts from a user-defined pool, concatenates the optimal prompts given the user instruction, and performs inference using the LoRA-fine-tuned LLMs. Compared with typical instruction fine-tuning methods, PILLOW exhibits commensurate performance on various evaluation metrics, utilizing only consumer-grade GPU resources and exhibiting a large increase in training efficiency.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.45	Zhenting Qi, Xiaoyu Tan, Shaojie Shi, Chao Qu, Yinghui Xu, Yuan Qi
Gold Standard Bangla OCR Dataset: An In-Depth Look at Data Preprocessing and Annotation Processes	This research paper focuses on developing an improved Bangla Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system, addressing the challenges posed by the complexity of Bangla text structure, diverse handwriting styles, and the scarcity of comprehensive datasets. Leveraging recent advancements in Deep Learning and OCR techniques, we anticipate a significant enhancement in the performance of Bangla OCR by utilizing a large and diverse collection of labeled Bangla text image datasets. This study introduces the most extensive gold standard corpus for Bangla characters and words, comprising over 4 million human-annotated images. Our dataset encompasses various document types, such as Computer Compose, Letterpress, Typewriters, Outdoor Banner-Poster, and Handwritten documents, gathered from diverse sources. The entire corpus has undergone meticulous human annotation, employing a controlled annotation procedure consisting of three-step annotation and one-step validation, ensuring adherence to gold standard criteria. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the complete data collection procedure.

EELBERT: Tiny Models through Dynamic Embeddings	We introduce EELBERT, an approach for compression of transformer-based models (e.g., BERT), with minimal impact on the accuracy of downstream tasks. This is achieved by replacing the input embedding layer of the model with dynamic, i.e. on-the-fly, embedding computations. Since the input embedding layer occupies a large portion of the model size, especially for the smaller BERT variants, replacing this layer with an embedding computation function helps us reduce the model size significantly. Empirical evaluation on the GLUE benchmark shows that our BERT variants (EELBERT) suffer minimal regression compared to the traditional BERT models. Through this approach, we are able to develop our smallest model UNO-EELBERT, which achieves a GLUE score within 4% of fully trained BERT-tiny, while being 15x smaller (1.2 MB) in size.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.43	Gabrielle Cohn, Rishika Agarwal, Deepanshu Gupta, Siddharth Patwardhan
Scaling Neural ITN for Numbers and Temporal Expressions in Tamil: Findings for an Agglutinative Low-resource Language	ITN involves rewriting the verbalised form of text from spoken transcripts to its corresponding written form. The task inherently expects challenges in identifying ITN entries due to spelling variations in words arising out of dialects, transcription errors etc. Additionally, in Tamil, word boundaries between adjacent words in a sentence often get obscured due to Punarchi, i.e. phonetic transformation of these boundaries. Being morphologically rich, the words in Tamil show a high degree of agglutination due to inflection and clitics. The combination of such factors leads to a high degree of surface-form variations, making scalability with pure rule-based approaches difficult. Instead, we experiment with fine-tuning three pre-trained neural LMs, consisting of a seq2seq model (s2s), a non-autoregressive text editor (NAR) and a sequence tagger + rules combination (tagger). While the tagger approach works best in a fully-supervised setting, s2s performs the best (98.05 F-Score) when augmented with additional data, via bootstrapping and data augmentation (DA&B). S2S reports a cumulative percentage improvement of 20.1 %, and statistically significant gains for all our models with DA&B. Compared to a fully supervised setup, bootstrapping alone reports a percentage improvement as high as 14.12 %, even with a small seed set of 324 ITN entries.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.42	Bhavuk Singhal, Sindhuja Gopalan, Amrith Krishna, Malolan Chetlur
Improving Contextual Query Rewrite for Conversational AI Agents through User-preference Feedback Learning	Contextual query rewriting (CQR) is a crucial component in Conversational AI agents, leveraging the contextual information from previous user-agent conversations to improve the comprehension of current user intent. However, traditional CQR methods often concentrate on supervised fine-tuning only, neglecting the opportunities to learn from user feedback to align with user preferences. Inspired by recent advances in learning from human feedback (LHF), this paper proposes a novel Preference Aligned Contextual Query Rewriting (PA-CQR) framework to enhance the CQR model's capability in generating user preference-aligned rewrites. This paper also investigates the efficacy of various state-of-the-art feedback learning algorithms on the CQR task, and proposes a novel Dynamic Direct Preference Optimization (Dynamic DPO) algorithm to better adapt the DPO algorithm to large-scale CQR training. Experiments on large-scale real-world CQR data set demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PA-CQR framework and the Dynamic DPO.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.41	Zhongkai Sun, Yingxue Zhou, Jie Hao, Xing Fan, Yanbin Lu, Chengyuan Ma, Wei Shen, Chenlei Guo
CL-QR: Cross-Lingual Enhanced Query Reformulation for Multi-lingual Conversational AI Agents	The growing popularity of conversational AI agents such as Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri rely on accurate spoken language comprehension. The query reformulation (QR) method, which reformulates defective user queries, has been broadly adopted to mitigate the challenges posed by understanding user's intent from imperfect spoken recognition result. However, due to the scarcity of non-English QR labels, providing high-quality QR for non-English users still remains a challenge. This work proposes a novel cross-lingual QR framework, CL-QR, to leverage the abundant reformulation resources in English to improve non-English QR performance. The proposed work also proposes a Module-wise Mutually-supervised Feedback learning (MMF) algorithm to enable the continually self-improving of the CL-QR, which alleviates the lack of cross-lingual QR training data and enhances the delivery of high-quality reformulations learned in English for multilingual queries.

In this paper, we conduct empirical studies and provide experimental evidences of their performance on a wide variety of financial text analytical problems, using eight benchmark datasets from five categories of tasks. We report both the strengths and limitations of the current models by comparing them to the state-of-the-art fine-tuned approaches and the recently released domain-specific pretrained models.

AART: AI-Assisted Red-Teaming with Diverse Data Generation for New LLM-powered Applications	Adversarially testing large language models (LLMs) is crucial for their safe and responsible deployment in practice. We introduce an AI-assisted approach for automated generation of adversarial evaluation datasets to test the safety of LLM generations on new downstream applications. We call it AART AI-assisted Red-Teaming - an automated alternative to current manual red-teaming efforts. AART offers a data generation and augmentation pipeline of reusable and customizable recipes that reduce significantly human effort and enable integration of adversarial testing earlier in new product development. AART generates evaluation datasets with high diversity of content characteristics critical for effective adversarial testing (e.g. sensitive and harmful concepts, specific to a wide range of cultural and geographic regions and application scenarios). The data generation is steered by AI-assisted recipes to define, scope and prioritize diversity within a new application context. This feeds into a structured LLM-generation process that scales up evaluation priorities. This provides transparency of developers evaluation intentions and enables quick adaptation to new use cases and newly discovered model weaknesses. Compared to some of the state-of-the-art tools AART shows promising results in terms of concept coverage and data quality.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.37	Bhaktipriya Radharapu, Kevin Robinson, Lora Aroyo, Preethi Lahoti

We address multiple practical problems that are not accounted for in public Text-to-SQL solutions – numerous complex implied conditions in user questions, jargon and abbreviations, custom calculations, non-SQL operations, a need to inject all those into pipeline fast and to have guaranteed parsing results for demanding users, cold-start problem. The DataQue processing pipeline for Text-to-SQL translation consists of 10-15 model-based and rule-based components that allows to tightly control the processing.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.36	Denis Kochedykov, Fenglin Yin, Sreevidya Khatravath
AdaBERT-CTC: Leveraging BERT-CTC for Text-Only Domain Adaptation in ASR	End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) models are becoming increasingly popular in commercial applications, such as virtual assistants, closed captioning, and dictation systems. The accuracy of the ASR is crucial to their success. However, E2E models still struggle to recognize out-of-domain words such as proper nouns and domain-specific terms. In this paper we introduce AdaBERT-CTC, a domain adaptation technique that relies solely on textual data. Our method allows for text-only adaptation by fine-tuning a pre-trained self-supervised text encoder model. Additionally, we show that our method can be made parameter-efficient by adding bottleneck adapters to the pre-trained model. This allows for adaptation with less than a 5% increase in parameters and minimal computational overhead during inference. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms the base BERT-CTC model by up to 14% relative word error rate improvement on several out-of-domain, publicly available datasets.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.35	Tyler Vuong, Karel Mundnich, Dhanush Bekal, Veera Elluru, Srikanth Ronanki, Sravan Bodapati
Creator Context for Tweet Recommendation	When discussing a tweet, people usually not only refer to the content it delivers, but also to the person behind the tweet. In other words, grounding the interpretation of the tweet in the context of its creator plays an important role in deciphering the true intent and the importance of the tweet. In this paper, we attempt to answer the question of how creator context should be used to advance tweet understanding. Specifically, we investigate the usefulness of different types of creator context, and examine different model structures for incorporating creator context in tweet modeling. We evaluate our tweet understanding models on a practical use case – recommending relevant tweets to news articles. This use case already exists in popular news apps, and can also serve as a useful assistive tool for journalists. We discover that creator context is essential for tweet understanding, and can improve application metrics by a large margin. However, we also observe that not all creator contexts are equal. Creator context can be time sensitive and noisy. Careful creator context selection and deliberate model structure design play an important role in creator context effectiveness.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.34	Spurthi Amba Hombaiah, Tao Chen, Mingyang Zhang, Michael Bendersky, Marc Najork, Matt Colen, Sergey Levi, Vladimir Ofitserov, Tanvir Amin
Building Real-World Meeting Summarization Systems using Large Language Models: A Practical Perspective	This paper studies how to effectively build meeting summarization systems for real-world usage using large language models (LLMs). For this purpose, we conduct an extensive evaluation and comparison of various closed-source and open-source LLMs, namely, GPT-4, GPT-3.5, PaLM-2, and LLaMA-2. Our findings reveal that most closed-source LLMs are generally better in terms of performance. However, much smaller open-source models like LLaMA-2 (7B and 13B) could still achieve performance comparable to the large closed-source models even in zero-shot scenarios. Considering the privacy concerns of closed-source models for only being accessible via API, alongside the high cost associated with using fine-tuned versions of the closed-source models, the opensource models that can achieve competitive performance are more advantageous for industrial use. Balancing performance with associated costs and privacy concerns, the LLaMA-2-7B model looks more promising for industrial usage. In sum, this paper offers practical insights on using LLMs for real-world business meeting summarization, shedding light on the trade-offs between performance and cost.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.33	Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar, Xue-Yong Fu, Cheng Chen, Shashi Bhushan TN
Coordinated Replay Sample Selection for Continual Federated Learning	Continual Federated Learning (CFL) combines Federated Learning (FL), the decentralized learning of a central model on a number of client devices that may not communicate their data, and Continual Learning (CL), the learning of a model from a continual stream of data without keeping the entire history. In CL, the main challenge is forgetting what was learned from past data. While replay-based algorithms that keep a small pool of past training data are effective to reduce forgetting, only simple replay sample selection strategies have been applied to CFL in prior work, and no previous work has explored coordination among clients for better sample selection. To bridge this gap, we adapt a replay sample selection objective based on loss gradient diversity to CFL and propose a new relaxation-based selection of samples to optimize the objective. Next, we propose a practical algorithm to coordinate gradient-based replay sample selection across clients without communicating private data. We benchmark our coordinated and uncoordinated replay sample selection algorithms against random sampling-based baselines with language models trained on a large scale de-identified real-world text dataset. We show that gradient-based sample selection methods both boost performance and reduce forgetting compared to random sampling methods, with our coordination method showing gains early in the low replay size regime (when the budget for storing past data is small).	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.32	Jack Good, Jimit Majmudar, Christophe Dupuy, Jixuan Wang, Charith Peris, Clement Chung, Richard Zemel, Rahul Gupta
Query-aware Multi-modal based Ranking Relevance in Video Search	Relevance ranking system plays a crucial role in video search on streaming platforms. Most relevance ranking methods focus on text modality, incapable of fully exploiting cross-modal cues present in video. Recent multi-modal models have demonstrated promise in various vision-language tasks but provide limited help for downstream query-video relevance tasks due to the discrepency between relevance ranking-agnostic pre-training objectives and the real video search scenarios that demand comprehensive relevance modeling. To address these challenges, we propose a QUery-Aware pre-training model with multi-modaLITY (QUALITY) that incorporates hard-mined query information as alignment targets and utilizes video tag information for guidance. QUALITY is integrated into our relevance ranking model, which leverages multi-modal knowledge and improves ranking optimization method based on ordinal regression. Extensive experiments show our proposed model significantly enhances video search performance.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.31	Chengcan Ye, Ting Peng, Tim Chang, Zhiyi Zhou, Feng Wang
Enhancing Extreme Multi-Label Text Classification: Addressing Challenges in Model, Data, and Evaluation	Extreme multi-label text classification is a prevalent task in industry, but it frequently encounters challenges in terms of machine learning perspectives, including model limitations, data scarcity, and time-consuming evaluation. This paper aims to mitigate these issues by introducing novel approaches. Firstly, we propose a label ranking model as an alternative to the conventional SciBERT-based classification model, enabling efficient handling of large-scale labels and accommodating new labels. Secondly, we present an active learning-based pipeline that addresses the data scarcity of new labels during the update of a classification system. Finally, we introduce ChatGPT to assist with model evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques in enhancing the extreme multi-label text classification task.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.30	Dan Li, Zi Long Zhu, Janneke van de Loo, Agnes Masip Gomez, Vikrant Yadav, Georgios Tsatsaronis, Zubair Afzal
Empower Large Language Model to Perform Better on Industrial Domain-Specific Question Answering	Large Language Model (LLM) has gained popularity and achieved remarkable results in open-domain tasks, but its performance in real industrial domain-specific scenarios is average due to its lack of specific domain knowledge. This issue has attracted widespread attention, but there are few relevant benchmarks available. In this paper, we provide a benchmark Question Answering (QA) dataset named MSQA, centered around Microsoft products and IT technical problems encountered by customers. This dataset contains industry cloud-specific QA knowledge, an area not extensively covered in general LLMs, making it well-suited for evaluating methods aiming to enhance LLMs' domain-specific capabilities. In addition, we propose a new model interaction paradigm that can empower LLM to achieve better performance on domain-specific tasks where it is not proficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the approach following our method outperforms the commonly used LLM with retrieval methods. We make our source code and sample data available at: https://aka.ms/Microsoft_QA.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.29	Fangkai Yang, Pu Zhao, Zezhong Wang, Lu Wang, Bo Qiao, Jue Zhang, Mohit Garg, Qingwei Lin, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang
Compute-Efficient Churn Reduction for Conversational Agents	"Model churn occurs when re-training a model yields different predictions despite using the same data and hyper-parameters. Churn reduction is crucial for industry conversational systems where users expect consistent results for the same queries. In this setting, compute resources are often limited due to latency requirements during serving and overall time constraints during re-training. To address this issue, we propose a compute-efficient method that mitigates churn without requiring extra resources for training or inference. Our approach involves a lightweight data pre-processing step that pairs semantic parses based on their ""function call signature"" and encourages similarity through an additional loss based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence. We validate the effectiveness of our method in three scenarios: academic (+3.93 percent improvement on average in a churn reduction metric), simulated noisy data (+8.09), and industry (+5.28) settings."	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.28	Christopher Hidey, Sarthak Sarthak
ORANGE: Text-video Retrieval via Watch-time-aware Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning	With the explosive growth of short-video data on industrial video-sharing platforms such as TikTok and YouTube, text-video retrieval techniques have become increasingly important. Most existing works for text-video retrieval focus on designing informative representation learning methods and delicate matching mechanisms, which leverage the content information of queries and videos themselves (i.e., textual information of queries and multimodal information of videos). However, real-world scenarios often involve brief, ambiguous queries and low-quality videos, making content-based retrieval less effective. In order to accommodate various search requirements and enhance user satisfaction, this study introduces a novel Text-video Retrieval method via Watch-time-aware Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning (termed ORANGE). This approach aims to learn informative embeddings for queries and videos by leveraging both content information and the abundant relational information present in video-search scenarios. Specifically, we first construct a heterogeneous information graph where nodes represent domain objects (e.g., query, video, tag) and edges represent rich relations among these objects. Afterwards, a meta-path-guided heterogeneous graph attention encoder with the awareness of video watch time is devised to encode various semantic aspects of query and video nodes. To train our model, we introduce a meta-path-wise contrastive learning paradigm that facilitates capturing dependencies across multiple semantic relations, thereby enhancing the obtained embeddings. Finally, when deployed online, for new queries non-existent in the constructed graph, a bert-based query encoder distilled from our ORANGE is employed. Offline experiments conducted on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our ORANGE. Moreover, it has been implemented in the matching stage of an industrial online video-search service, where it exhibited statistically significant improvements over the online baseline in an A/B test.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.27	Yucheng Lin, Tim Chang, Yaning Chang, Jianqiang Ma, Donghui Li, Ting Peng, Zang Li, Zhiyi Zhou, Feng Wang
Unveiling Identity Biases in Toxicity Detection : A Game-Focused Dataset and Reactivity Analysis Approach	Identity biases arise commonly from annotated datasets, can be propagated in language models and can cause further harm to marginal groups. Existing bias benchmarking datasets are mainly focused on gender or racial biases and are made to pinpoint which class the model is biased towards. They also are not designed for the gaming industry, a concern for models built for toxicity detection in videogames' chat. We propose a dataset and a method to highlight oversensitive terms using reactivity analysis and the model's performance. We test our dataset against ToxBuster, a language model developed by Ubisoft fine-tuned for toxicity detection on multiplayer videogame's written chat, and Perspective API. We find that these toxicity models often automatically tag terms related to a community's identity as toxic, which prevents members of already marginalized groups to make their presence known or have a mature / normal conversation. Through this process, we have generated an interesting list of terms that trigger the models to varying degrees, along with insights on establishing a baseline through human annotations.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.26	Josiane Van Dorpe, Zachary Yang, Nicolas Grenon-Godbout, Grégoire Winterstein
Lattice Path Edit Distance: A Romanization-aware Edit Distance for Extracting Misspelling-Correction Pairs from Japanese Search Query Logs	Edit distance has been successfully used to extract training data, i.e., misspelling-correction pairs, of spelling correction models from search query logs in languages including English. However, the success does not readily apply to Japanese, where misspellings are often dissimilar to correct spellings due to the romanization-based input methods. To address this problem, we introduce lattice path edit distance, which utilizes romanization lattices to efficiently consider all possible romanized forms of input strings. Empirical experiments using Japanese search query logs demonstrated that the lattice path edit distance outperformed baseline methods including the standard edit distance combined with an existing transliterator and morphological analyzer. A training data collection pipeline that uses the lattice path edit distance has been deployed in production at our search engine for over a year.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.24	Nobuhiro Kaji
PROMINET: Prototype-based Multi-View Network for Interpretable Email Response Prediction	Email is a widely used tool for business communication, and email marketing has emerged as a cost-effective strategy for enterprises. While previous studies have examined factors affecting email marketing performance, limited research has focused on understanding email response behavior by considering email content and metadata. This study proposes a Prototype-based Multi-view Network (PROMINET) that incorporates semantic and structural information from email data. By utilizing prototype learning, the PROMINET model generates latent exemplars, enabling interpretable email response prediction. The model maps learned semantic and structural exemplars to observed samples in the training data at different levels of granularity, such as document, sentence, or phrase. The approach is evaluated on two real-world email datasets: the Enron corpus and an in-house Email Marketing corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that the PROMINET model outperforms baseline models, achieving a ~3% improvement in F1 score on both datasets. Additionally, the model provides interpretability through prototypes at different granularity levels while maintaining comparable performance to non-interpretable models. The learned prototypes also show potential for generating suggestions to enhance email text editing and improve the likelihood of effective email responses. This research contributes to enhancing sender-receiver communication and customer engagement in email interactions.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.21	Yuqing Wang, Prashanth Vijayaraghavan, Ehsan Degan
Learning Multilingual Sentence Representations with Cross-lingual Consistency Regularization	Multilingual sentence representations are the foundation for similarity-based bitext mining, which is crucial for scaling multilingual neural machine translation (NMT) system to more languages. In this paper, we introduce MuSR: a one-for-all Multilingual Sentence Representation model that supports 223 languages. Leveraging billions of English-centric parallel corpora, we train a multilingual Transformer encoder, coupled with an auxiliary Transformer decoder, by adopting a multilingual NMT framework with CrossConST, a cross-lingual consistency regularization technique proposed in Gao et al. (2023). Experimental results on multilingual similarity search and bitext mining tasks show the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, MuSR achieves superior performance over LASER3 (Heffernan et al., 2022) which consists of 148 independent multilingual sentence encoders.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.25	Pengzhi Gao, Liwen Zhang, Zhongjun He, Hua Wu, Haifeng Wang
AdapterDistillation: Non-Destructive Task Composition with Knowledge Distillation	Leveraging knowledge from multiple tasks through introducing a small number of task specific parameters into each transformer layer, also known as adapters, receives much attention recently. However, adding an extra fusion layer to implement knowledge composition not only increases the inference time but also is non-scalable for some applications. To avoid these issues, we propose a two-stage knowledge distillation algorithm called AdapterDistillation. In the first stage, we extract task specific knowledge by using local data to train a student adapter. In the second stage, we distill the knowledge from the existing teacher adapters into the student adapter to help its inference. Extensive experiments on frequently asked question retrieval in task-oriented dialog systems validate the efficiency of AdapterDistillation. We show that AdapterDistillation outperforms existing algorithms in terms of accuracy, resource consumption and inference time.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.20	Junjie Wang, Yicheng Chen, Wangshu Zhang, Sen Hu, Teng Xu, Jing Zheng
Joint Dialogue Topic Segmentation and Categorization: A Case Study on Clinical Spoken Conversations	Utilizing natural language processing techniques in clinical conversations is effective to improve the efficiency of health management workflows for medical staff and patients. Dialogue segmentation and topic categorization are two fundamental steps for processing verbose spoken conversations and highlighting informative spans for downstream tasks. However, in practical use cases, due to the variety of segmentation granularity and topic definition, and the lack of diverse annotated corpora, no generic models are readily applicable for domain-specific applications. In this work, we introduce and adopt a joint model for dialogue segmentation and topic categorization, and conduct a case study on healthcare follow-up calls for diabetes management; we provide insights from both data and model perspectives toward performance and robustness.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.19	Zhengyuan Liu, Siti Umairah Md Salleh, Hong Choon Oh, Pavitra Krishnaswamy, Nancy Chen
TMID: A Comprehensive Real-world Dataset for Trademark Infringement Detection in E-Commerce	Annually, e-commerce platforms incur substantial financial losses due to trademark infringements, making it crucial to identify and mitigate potential legal risks tied to merchant information registered to the platforms. However, the absence of high-quality datasets hampers research in this area. To address this gap, our study introduces TMID, a novel dataset to detect trademark infringement in merchant registrations. This is a real-world dataset sourced directly from Alipay, one of the world's largest e-commerce and digital payment platforms. As infringement detection is a legal reasoning task requiring an understanding of the contexts and legal rules, we offer a thorough collection of legal rules and merchant and trademark-related contextual information with annotations from legal experts. We ensure the data quality by performing an extensive statistical analysis. Furthermore, we conduct an empirical study on this dataset to highlight its value and the key challenges. Through this study, we aim to contribute valuable resources to advance research into legal compliance related to trademark infringement within the e-commerce sphere.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.18	Tongxin Hu, Zhuang Li, Xin Jin, Lizhen Qu, Xin Zhang
Investigating Table-to-Text Generation Capabilities of Large Language Models in Real-World Information Seeking Scenarios	Tabular data is prevalent across various industries, necessitating significant time and effort for users to understand and manipulate for their information-seeking purposes. The advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown enormous potential to improve user efficiency. However, the adoption of LLMs in real-world applications for table information seeking remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the table-to-text capabilities of different LLMs using four datasets within two real-world information seeking scenarios. These include the LogicNLG and our newly-constructed LoTNLG datasets for data insight generation, along with the FeTaQA and our newly-constructed F2WTQ datasets for query-based generation. We structure our investigation around three research questions, evaluating the performance of LLMs in table-to-text generation, automated evaluation, and feedback generation, respectively. Experimental results indicate that the current high-performing LLM, specifically GPT-4, can effectively serve as a table-to-text generator, evaluator, and feedback generator, facilitating users' information seeking purposes in real-world scenarios. However, a significant performance gap still exists between other open-sourced LLMs (e.g., Vicuna and LLaMA-2) and GPT-4 models. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/yale-nlp/LLM-T2T.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.17	Yilun Zhao, Haowei Zhang, Shengyun Si, Linyong Nan, Xiangru Tang, Arman Cohan
Does Named Entity Recognition Truly Not Scale Up to Real-world Product Attribute Extraction?	The key challenge in the attribute-value extraction (AVE) task from e-commerce sites is the scalability to diverse attributes for a large number of products in real-world e-commerce sites. To make AVE scalable to diverse attributes, recent researchers adopted a question-answering (QA)-based approach that additionally inputs the target attribute as a query to extract its values, and confirmed its advantage over a classical approach based on named-entity recognition (NER) on real-word e-commerce datasets. In this study, we argue the scalability of the NER-based approach compared to the QA-based approach, since researchers have compared BERT-based QA-based models to only a weak BiLSTM-based NER baseline trained from scratch in terms of only accuracy on datasets designed to evaluate the QA-based approach. Experimental results using a publicly available real-word dataset revealed that, under a fair setting, BERT-based NER models rival BERT-based QA models in terms of the accuracy, and their inference is faster than the QA model that processes the same product text several times to handle multiple target attributes.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.16	Wei-Te Chen, Keiji Shinzato, Naoki Yoshinaga, Yandi Xia
Multi-teacher Distillation for Multilingual Spelling Correction	Accurate spelling correction is a critical step in modern search interfaces, especially in an era of mobile devices and speech-to-text interfaces. For services that are deployed around the world, this poses a significant challenge for multilingual NLP: spelling errors need to be caught and corrected in all languages, and even in queries that use multiple languages. In this paper, we tackle this challenge using multi-teacher distillation. On our approach, a monolingual teacher model is trained for each language/locale, and these individual models are distilled into a single multilingual student model intended to serve all languages/locales. In experiments using open-source data as well as customer data from a worldwide search service, we show that this leads to highly effective spelling correction models that can meet the tight latency requirements of deployed services.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.15	Jingfen Zhang, Xuan Guo, Sravan Bodapati, Christopher Potts
KD-Boost: Boosting Real-Time Semantic Matching in E-commerce with Knowledge Distillation	Real-time semantic matching is vital to web and product search. Transformer-based models have shown to be highly effective at encoding queries into an embedding space where semantically similar entities (queries or results) are in close proximity. However, the computational complexity of large transformer models limits their utilization for real-time matching. In this paper, we propose KD-Boost, a novel knowledge distillation algorithm designed for real-time semantic matching. KD-Boost trains low latency accurate student models by leveraging soft labels from a teacher model as well as ground truth via pairwise query-product and query-query signal derived from direct audits, user behavior, and taxonomy-based data using custom loss functions. Experiments on internal and external e-commerce datasets demonstrate an improvement of 2-3% ROC-AUC compared to training student models directly, outperforming teacher and SOTA knowledge distillation benchmarks. Simulated online A/B tests using KD-Boost for automated Query Reformulation (QR) indicate a 6.31% increase in query-to-query matching, 2.76% increase in product coverage, and a 2.19% improvement in relevance.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.14	Sanjay Agrawal, Vivek Sembium, Ankith M S
SAMP: A Model Inference Toolkit of Post-Training Quantization for Text Processing via Self-Adaptive Mixed-Precision	The latest industrial inference engines, such as FasterTransformer and TurboTransformers, have verified that half-precision floating point (FP16) and 8-bit integer (INT8) quantization can greatly improve model inference speed. However, the existing INT8 quantization methods are too complicated, and improper usage will lead to model performance damage greatly. In this paper, we develop a toolkit for users to easily quantize their models for inference, in which Self-Adaptive Mixed-Precision (SAMP) is proposed to automatically control quantization rate by a mixed-precision architecture to balance model accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show that our SAMP toolkit has a higher speedup than PyTorch and FasterTransformer while ensuring the required accuracy. In addition, SAMP is based on a modular design, decoupling the tokenizer, embedding, encoder and target layers, which allows users to handle various downstream tasks and can be seamlessly integrated into PyTorch.	https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-industry.13	Rong Tian, Zijing Zhao, Weijie Liu, Haoyan Liu, Weiquan Mao, Zhe Zhao, Kan Zhou
