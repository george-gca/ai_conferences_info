Modeling Varying Camera-IMU Time Offset in Optimization-Based Visual-Inertial Odometry	Combining cameras and inertial measurement units (IMUs) has been proven effective in motion tracking, as these two sensing modalities offer complementary characteristics that are suitable for fusion. While most works focus on global-shutter cameras and synchronized sensor measurements, consumer-grade devices are mostly equipped with rolling-shutter cameras and suffer from imperfect sensor synchronization. In this work, we propose a nonlinear optimization-based monocular visual inertial odometry (VIO) with varying camera-IMU time offset modeled as an unknown variable. Our approach is able to handle the rolling-shutter effects and imperfect sensor synchronization in a unified way. Additionally, we introduce an efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming and red-black tree to speed up IMU integration over variable-length time intervals during the optimization. An uncertainty-aware initialization is also presented to launch the VIO robustly. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on the Euroc dataset and mobile phone data are shown to validate the effectiveness of our approach.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yonggen_Ling_Modeling_Varying_Camera-IMU_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yonggen Ling, Linchao Bao, Zequn Jie, Fengming Zhu, Ziyang Li, Shanmin Tang, Yongsheng Liu, Wei Liu, Tong Zhang
Recurrent Fusion Network for Image captioning	Recently, much advance has been made in image captioning, and an encoder-decoder framework has been adopted by all the state-of-the-art models. Under this framework, an input image is encoded by a convolutional neural network (CNN) and then translated into natural language with a recurrent neural network (RNN). The existing models counting on this framework employ only one kind of CNNs, extit{e.g.}, ResNet or Inception-X, which describes the image contents from only one specific view point. Thus, the semantic meaning of the input image cannot be comprehensively understood, which restricts improving the performance. In this paper, to exploit the complementary information from multiple encoders, we propose a novel recurrent fusion network (RFNet) for the image captioning task. The fusion process in our model can exploit the interactions among the outputs of the image encoders and generate new compact and informative representations for the decoder. Experiments on the MSCOCO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed RFNet, which sets a new state-of-the-art for image captioning.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Wenhao_Jiang_Recurrent_Fusion_Network_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Wenhao Jiang, Lin Ma, Yu-Gang Jiang, Wei Liu, Tong Zhang
Second-order Democratic Aggregation	Aggregated second-order features extracted from deep convolutional networks have been shown to be effective for texture generation, fine-grained recognition, material classification, and scene understanding. In this paper we study a class of orderless aggregation functions designed to minimize emph{interference} or equalize emph{contributions} in the context of second-order features and show that they can be computed just as efficiently as their first-order counterparts and have favorable properties over aggregation by summation. Another line of work has shown that matrix power normalization after aggregation can significantly improve the generalization of second-order representations. We show that matrix power normalization implicitly equalizes contributions during aggregation thus establishing a connection between matrix normalization techniques and prior work on minimizing interference. Based on the analysis we present $gamma$-democratic aggregators that interpolate between sum ($gamma$=1) and democratic pooling ($gamma$=0) outperforming both on several classification tasks. Moreover unlike power normalization the $gamma$-democratic aggregations can be computed in a low dimensional space using sketching allowing the use of very high-dimensional second-order features. This results in a state-of-the-art performance on several datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tsung-Yu_Lin_Second-order_Democratic_Aggregation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tsung-Yu Lin, Subhransu Maji, Piotr Koniusz
Learning to Blend Photos	Photo blending is a common technique to create aesthetically pleasing artworks by combining multiple photos. However, the process of photo blending is usually time-consuming, and care must be taken in the process of blending, filtering, positioning, and masking each of the source photos. To make photo blending accessible to general public, we propose an efficient approach for automatic photo blending via deep learning. Specifically, given a foreground image and a background image, our proposed method automatically generates a set of blending photos with scores that indicate the aesthetics quality with the proposed quality network and policy network. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively generate high quality blending photos with efficiency.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Wei-Chih_Hung_Learning_to_Blend_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Wei-Chih Hung, Jianming Zhang, Xiaohui Shen, Zhe Lin, Joon-Young Lee, Ming-Hsuan Yang
Deep Cross-modality Adaptation via Semantics Preserving Adversarial Learning for Sketch-based 3D Shape Retrieval	Due to the large cross-modality discrepancy between 2D sketches and 3D shapes, retrieving 3D shapes by sketches is a significantly challenging task. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework to learn a discriminative deep cross-modality adaptation model in this paper. Specifically, we first separately adopt two metric networks, following two deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to learn modality-specific discriminative features based on an importance-aware metric learning method. Subsequently, we explicitly introduce a cross-modality transformation network to compensate for the divergence between two modalities, which can transfer features of 2D sketches to the feature space of 3D shapes. We develop an adversarial learning based method to train the transformation model, by simultaneously enhancing the holistic correlations between data distributions of two modalities, and mitigating the local semantic divergences through minimizing a cross-modality mean discrepancy term. Experimental results on the SHREC 2013 and SHREC 2014 datasets clearly show the superior retrieval performance of our proposed model, compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jiaxin_Chen_Deep_Cross-modality_Adaptation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jiaxin Chen, Yi Fang
ISNN: Impact Sound Neural Network for Audio-Visual Object Classification	3D object geometry reconstruction remains a challenge when working with transparent, occluded, or highly reflective surfaces. While recent methods classify shape features using raw audio, we present a multimodal neural network optimized for estimating an object's geometry and material. Our networks use spectrograms of recorded and synthesized object impact sounds and voxelized shape estimates to extend the capabilities of vision-based reconstruction. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets of both recorded and synthesized sounds. We further present an interactive application for real-time scene reconstruction in which a user can strike objects, producing sound that can instantly classify and segment the struck object, even if the object is transparent or visually occluded.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Auston_Sterling_ISNN_-_Impact_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Auston Sterling, Justin Wilson, Sam Lowe, Ming C.

DeepGUM: Learning Deep Robust Regression with a Gaussian-Uniform Mixture Model	In this paper we address the problem of how to robustly train a ConvNet for regression, or deep robust regression. Traditionally, deep regression employ the L2 loss function, known to be sensitive to outliers, i.e. samples that either lie at an abnormal distance away from the majority of the training samples, or that correspond to wrongly annotated targets. This means that, during back-propagation, outliers may bias the training process due to the high magnitude of their gradient. In this paper, we propose DeepGUM: a deep regression model that is robust to outliers thanks to the use of a Gaussian-uniform mixture model. We derive an optimization algorithm that alternates between the unsupervised detection of outliers using expectation-maximization, and the supervised training with cleaned samples using stochastic gradient descent. DeepGUM is able to adapt to a continuously evolving outlier distribution, avoiding to manually impose any threshold on the proportion of outliers in the training set. Extensive experimental evaluations on four different tasks (facial and fashion landmark detection, age and head pose estimation) lead us to conclude that our novel robust technique provides reliability in the presence of various types of noise and protection against a high percentage of outliers.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Stephane_Lathuiliere_DeepGUM_Learning_Deep_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Stephane Lathuiliere, Pablo Mesejo, Xavier Alameda-Pineda, Radu Horaud
Deep Kalman Filtering Network for Video Compression Artifact Reduction	When lossy video compression algorithms are applied, compression artifacts often appear in videos, making decoded videos unpleasant for human visual systems. In this paper, we model the video artifact reduction task as a Kalman filtering procedure and restore decoded frames through a deep Kalman filtering network. Different from the existing works using the noisy previous decoded frames as the temporal information in restoration problem, we utilize the less noisy previous restored frame and build a recursive filtering scheme based on Kalman model. This strategy can provide more accurate and consistent temporal information, which produces higher quality restoration. In addition, the strong prior information of the prediction residual is also exploited for restoration through a well designed neural network. These two components are combined under the Kalman framework and optimized through the deep Kalman filtering network. Our approach can well bridge the gap between the model-based methods and learning-based methods by integrating the recursive nature of the Kalman model and highly non-linear transformation ability of deep neural network. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Guo_Lu_Deep_Kalman_Filtering_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Guo Lu, Wanli Ouyang, Dong Xu, Xiaoyun Zhang, Zhiyong Gao, Ming-Ting Sun
Highly-Economized Multi-View Binary Compression for Scalable Image Clustering	How to economically cluster large-scale multi-view images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces a novel approach named Highly-economized Scalable Image Clustering (HSIC) that radically surpasses conventional image clustering methods via binary compression. We intuitively unify the binary representation learning and efficient binary cluster structure learning into a joint framework. In particular, common binary representations are learned by exploiting both sharable and individual information across multiple views in order to capture their underlying correlations. Meanwhile, cluster assignment with robust binary centroids is also performed via effective discrete optimization under L21-norm constraint. By this means, heavy continuous-valued Euclidean distance computations can be successfully reduced by efficient binary XOR operations during the clustering procedure. To our best knowledge, HSIC is the first binary clustering work specifically designed for scalable multi-view image clustering. Extensive experimental results on four large-scale image datasets show that HSIC consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, whilst significantly reducing computational time and memory footprint.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zheng_Zhang_Highly-Economized_Multi-View_Binary_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zheng Zhang, Li Liu, Jie Qin, Fan Zhu, Fumin Shen, Yong Xu, Ling Shao, Heng Tao Shen
Contemplating Visual Emotions: Understanding and Overcoming Dataset Bias	While machine learning approaches to visual emotion recognition offer great promise, current methods consider training and testing models on small scale datasets covering limited visual emotion concepts. Our analysis identifies an important but long overlooked issue of existing visual emotion benchmarks in the form of dataset biases. We design a series of tests to show and measure how such dataset biases obstruct learning a generalizable emotion recognition model. Based on our analysis, we propose a webly supervised approach by leveraging a large quantity of stock image data. Our approach uses a simple yet effective curriculum guided training strategy for learning discriminative emotion features. We discover that the models learned using our large scale stock image dataset exhibit significantly better generalization ability than the existing datasets without the manual collection of even a single label. Moreover, visual representation learned using our approach holds a lot of promise across a variety of tasks on different image and video datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Rameswar_Panda_Contemplating_Visual_Emotions_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Rameswar Panda, Jianming Zhang, Haoxiang Li, Joon-Young Lee, Xin Lu, Amit K.

RT-GENE: Real-Time Eye Gaze Estimation in Natural Environments	In this work, we consider the problem of robust gaze estimation in natural environments. Large camera-to-subject distances and high variations in head pose and eye gaze angles are common in such environments. This leads to two main shortfalls in state-of-the-art methods for gaze estimation: hindered ground truth gaze annotation and diminished gaze estimation accuracy as image resolution decreases with distance. We first record a novel dataset of varied gaze and head pose images in a natural environment, addressing the issue of ground truth annotation by measuring head pose using a motion capture system and eye gaze using mobile eyetracking glasses. We apply semantic image inpainting to the area covered by the glasses to bridge the gap between training and testing images by removing the obtrusiveness of the glasses. We also present a new real-time algorithm involving appearance-based deep convolutional neural networks with increased capacity to cope with the diverse images in the new dataset. Experiments with this network architecture are conducted on a number of diverse eye-gaze datasets including our own, and in cross dataset evaluations. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of estimation accuracy in all experiments, and the architecture performs well even on lower resolution images.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tobias_Fischer_RT-GENE_Real-Time_Eye_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tobias Fischer, Hyung Jin Chang, Yiannis Demiris
PyramidBox: A Context-assisted Single Shot Face Detector	Face detection has been well studied for many years and one of remaining challenges is to detect small, blurred and partially occluded faces in uncontrolled environment. This paper proposes a novel context-assisted single shot face detector, named emph{PyramidBox} to handle the hard face detection problem. Observing the importance of the context, we improve the utilization of contextual information in the following three aspects. First, we design a novel context anchor to supervise high-level contextual feature learning by a semi-supervised method, which we call it PyramidAnchors. Second, we propose the Low-level Feature Pyramid Network to combine adequate high-level context semantic feature and Low-level facial feature together, which also allows the PyramidBox to predict faces of all scales in a single shot. Third, we introduce a context-sensitive structure to increase the capacity of prediction network to improve the final accuracy of output. In addition, we use the method of Data-anchor-sampling to augment the training samples across different scales, which increases the diversity of training data for smaller faces. By exploiting the value of context, PyramidBox achieves superior performance among the state-of-the-art over the two common face detection benchmarks, FDDB and WIDER FACE.

Attend and Rectify: a gated attention mechanism for fine-grained recovery	We propose a novel attention mechanism to enhance Convolutional Neural Networks for fine-grained recognition. It learns to attend to lower-level feature activations without requiring part annotations and uses these activations to update and rectify the output likelihood distribution. In contrast to other approaches, the proposed mechanism is modular, architecture-independent and efficient both in terms of parameters and computation required. Experiments show that networks augmented with our approach systematically improve their classification accuracy and become more robust to clutter. As a result, Wide Residual Networks augmented with our proposal surpasses the state of the art classification accuracies in CIFAR-10, the Adience gender recognition task, Stanford dogs, and UEC Food-100.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Pau_Rodriguez_Lopez_Attend_and_Rectify_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Pau Rodriguez, Josep M.

Audio-Visual Event Localization in Unconstrained Videos	In this paper, we introduce a novel problem of audio-visual event localization in unconstrained videos. We define an audio-visual event as an event that is both visible and audible in a video segment. We collect an Audio-Visual Event (AVE) dataset to systemically investigate three temporal localization tasks: supervised and weakly-supervised audio-visual event localization, and cross-modality localization. We develop an audio-guided visual attention mechanism to explore audio-visual correlations, propose a dual multimodal residual network (DMRN) to fuse information over the two modalities, and introduce an audio-visual distance learning network to handle the cross-modality localization. Our experiments support the following findings: joint modeling of auditory and visual modalities outperforms independent modeling, the learned attention can capture semantics of sounding objects, temporal alignment is important for audio-visual fusion, the proposed DMRN is effective in fusing audio-visual features, and strong correlations between the two modalities enable cross-modality localization.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yapeng_Tian_Audio-Visual_Event_Localization_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yapeng Tian, Jing Shi, Bochen Li, Zhiyao Duan, Chenliang Xu
MVSNet: Depth Inference for Unstructured Multi-view Stereo	We present an end-to-end deep learning architecture for depth map inference from multi-view images. In the network, we first extract deep visual image features, and then build the 3D cost volume upon the reference camera frustum via the differentiable homography warping. Next, we apply 3D convolutions to regularize and regress the initial depth map, which is then refined with the reference image to generate the final output. Our framework flexibly adapts arbitrary N-view inputs using a variance-based cost metric that maps multiple features into one cost feature. The proposed method is demonstrated on the large-scale DTU dataset. With simple post-processing, MVSNet not only significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-arts, but also is several times faster in runtime. In the end, we also show the generalization power of MVSNet on the complex outdoor Tanks and Temples dataset, which has not been used to train the network.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yao_Yao_MVSNet_Depth_Inference_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yao Yao, Zixin Luo, Shiwei Li, Tian Fang, Long Quan
The Mutex Watershed: Efficient, Parameter-Free Image Partitioning	"Image partitioning, or segmentation without semantics, is the task of decomposing an image into distinct segments; or equivalently, the task of detecting closed contours in an image. Most prior work either requires seeds, one per segment; or a threshold; or formulates the task as an NP-hard signed graph partitioning problem. Here, we propose an algorithm with empirically linearithmic complexity. Unlike seeded watershed, the algorithm can accommodate not only attractive but also repulsive cues, allowing it to find a previously unspecified number of segments without the need for explicit seeds or a tunable threshold. The algorithm itself, which we dub ""mutex watershed"", is closely related to a minimal spanning tree computation. It is deterministic and easy to implement. When presented with short-range attractive and long-range repulsive cues from a deep neural network, the mutex watershed gives results that currently define the state-of-the-art in the competitive ISBI 2012 EM segmentation benchmark. These results are also better than those obtained from other recently proposed clustering strategies operating on the very same network outputs."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Steffen_Wolf_The_Mutex_Watershed_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Steffen Wolf, Constantin Pape, Alberto Bailoni, Nasim Rahaman, Anna Kreshuk, Ullrich Kothe, FredA.

Compositional Learning for Human Object Interaction	The world of human-object interactions is rich. While generally we sit on chairs and sofas, if need be we can even sit on TVs or top of shelves. In recent years, there has been progress in modeling actions and human-object interactions. However, most of these approaches require lots of data. It is not clear if the learned representations of actions are generalizable to new categories. In this paper, we explore the problem of zero-shot learning of human-object interactions. Given limited verb-noun interactions in training data, we want to learn a model than can work even on unseen combinations. To deal with this problem, In this paper, we propose a novel method using external knowledge graph and graph convolutional networks which learns how to compose classifiers for verb-noun pairs. We also provide benchmarks on several dataset for zero-shot learning including both image and video. We hope our method, dataset and baselines will facilitate future research in this direction.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Keizo_Kato_Compositional_Learning_of_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Keizo Kato, Yin Li, Abhinav Gupta
Universal Sketch Perceptual Grouping	In this work we aim to develop a universal sketch grouper. That is, a grouper that can be applied to sketches of any category in any domain to group constituent strokes/segments into semantically meaningful object parts. The first obstacle to this goal is the lack of large-scale datasets with grouping annotation. To overcome this, we contribute the largest sketch perceptual grouping (SPG) dataset to date, consisting of 20,000 unique sketches evenly distributed over 25 object categories. Furthermore, we propose a novel deep universal perceptual grouping model. The model is learned with both generative and discriminative losses. The generative losses improve the generalisation ability of the model to unseen object categories and datasets. The discriminative losses include a local grouping loss and a novel global grouping loss to enforce global grouping consistency. We show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art groupers. Further, we show that our grouper is useful for a number of sketch analysis tasks including sketch synthesis and fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR).	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ke_LI_Universal_Sketch_Perceptual_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ke Li, Kaiyue Pang, Jifei Song, Yi-Zhe Song, Tao Xiang, Timothy M.

ReenactGAN: Learning to Reenact Faces via Boundary Transfer	We present a novel learning-based framework for face reenactment. The proposed method, known as ReenactGAN, is capable of transferring facial movements and expressions from an arbitrary person's monocular video input to a target person's video. Instead of performing a direct transfer in the pixel space, which could result in structural artifacts, we first map the source face onto a boundary latent space. A transformer is subsequently used to adapt the source face's boundary to the target's boundary. Finally, a target-specific decoder is used to generate the reenacted target face. Thanks to the effective and reliable boundary-based transfer, our method can perform photo-realistic face reenactment. In addition, ReenactGAN is appealing in that the whole reenactment process is purely feed-forward, and thus the reenactment process can run in real-time (30 FPS on one GTX 1080 GPU). Dataset and model are publicly available on our project page.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Wayne_Wu_Learning_to_Reenact_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Wayne Wu, Yunxuan Zhang, Cheng Li, Chen Qian, Chen Change Loy
Modeling Visual Context is Key to Augmenting Object Detection Datasets	Performing data augmentation for learning deep neural networks is well known to be important for training visual recognition systems. By artificially increasing the number of training examples, it helps reducing overfitting and improves generalization. For object detection, classical approaches for data augmentation consist of generating images obtained by basic geometrical transformations and color changes of original training images. In this work, we go one step further and leverage segmentation annotations to increase the number of object instances present on training data. For this approach to be successful, we show that modeling appropriately the visual context surrounding objects is crucial to place them in the right environment. Otherwise, we show that the previous strategy actually hurts. With our context model, we achieve significant mean average precision improvements when few labeled examples are available on the VOC'12 benchmark.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/NIKITA_DVORNIK_Modeling_Visual_Context_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Nikita Dvornik, Julien Mairal, Cordelia Schmid
Cross-Modal Hamming Hashing	Cross-modal hashing enables similarity retrieval across different content modalities, such as searching relevant images in response to text queries. It provides with the advantages of computation efficiency and retrieval quality for multimedia retrieval. Hamming space retrieval enables efficient constant-time search that returns data items within a given Hamming radius to each query, by hash lookups instead of linear scan. However, Hamming space retrieval is ineffective in existing cross-modal hashing methods, subject to their weak capability of concentrating the relevant items to be within a small Hamming ball, while worse still, the Hamming distances between hash codes from different modalities are inevitably large due to the large heterogeneity across different modalities. This work presents Cross-Modal Hamming Hashing (CMHH), a novel deep cross-modal hashing approach that generates compact and highly concentrated hash codes to enable efficient and effective Hamming space retrieval. The main idea is to penalize significantly on similar cross-modal pairs with Hamming distance larger than the Hamming radius threshold, by designing a pairwise focal loss based on the exponential distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CMHH can generate highly concentrated hash codes and achieve state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval performance for both hash lookups and linear scan scenarios on three benchmark datasets, NUS-WIDE, MIRFlickr-25K, and IAPR TC-12.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yue_Cao_Cross-Modal_Hamming_Hashing_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yue Cao , Bin Liu, Mingsheng Long, Jianmin Wang
Pose-Normalized Image Generation for Person Re-identification	Person Re-identification (re-id) faces two major challenges: the lack of cross-view paired training data and learning discriminative identity-sensitive and view-invariant features in the presence of large pose variations. In this work, we address both problems by proposing a novel deep person image generation model for synthesizing realistic person images conditional on the pose. The model is based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) designed specifically for pose normalization in re-id, thus termed pose-normalization GAN (PN-GAN). With the synthesized images, we can learn a new type of deep re-id features free of the influence of pose variations. We show that these features are complementary to features learned with the original images. Importantly, a more realistic unsupervised learning setting is considered in this work, and our model is shown to have the potential to be generalizable to a new re-id dataset without any fine-tuning. The codes will be released at https://github.com/naiq/PN_GAN.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xuelin_Qian_Pose-Normalized_Image_Generation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xuelin Qian, Yanwei Fu, Tao Xiang, Wenxuan Wang, Jie Qiu, Yang Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang, Xiangyang Xue
Maximum Margin Metric Learning Over Discriminative Nullspace for Person Re-identification	In this paper we propose a novel metric learning framework called Nullspace Kernel Maximum Margin Metric Learning (NK3ML) which efficiently addresses the small sample size (SSS) problem inherent in person re-identification and offers a significant performance gain over existing state-of-the-art methods. Taking advantage of the very high dimensionality of the feature space, the metric is learned using a maximum margin criterion (MMC) over a discriminative nullspace where all training sample points of a given class map onto a single point, minimizing the within class scatter. A kernel version of MMC is used to obtain a better between class separation. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmark datasets for person re-identification demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms all existing methods. We obtain 99.8% rank-1 accuracy on the most widely accepted and challenging dataset VIPeR, compared to the previous state of the art being only 63.92%. This is the first time in the literature for person re-identification, a method competes to human level perfection.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/T_M_Feroz_Ali_Maximum_Margin_Metric_ECCV_2018_paper.php	T M Feroz Ali, Subhasis Chaudhuri
Deep Component Analysis via Alternating Direction Neural Networks	Despite a lack of theoretical understanding, deep neural networks have achieved unparalleled performance in a wide range of applications. On the other hand, shallow representation learning with component analysis is associated with rich intuition and theory, but smaller capacity often limits its usefulness. To bridge this gap, we introduce Deep Component Analysis (DeepCA), an expressive multilayer model formulation that enforces hierarchical structure through constraints on latent variables in each layer. For inference, we propose a differentiable optimization algorithm implemented using recurrent Alternating Direction Neural Networks (ADNNs) that enable parameter learning using standard backpropagation. By interpreting feed-forward networks as single-iteration approximations of inference in our model, we provide both a novel perspective for understanding them and a practical technique for constraining predictions with prior knowledge. Experimentally, we demonstrate performance improvements on a variety of tasks, including single-image depth prediction with sparse output constraints.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Calvin_Murdock_Deep_Component_Analysis_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Calvin Murdock, MingFang Chang, Simon Lucey
Structural Consistency and Controllability for Diverse Colorization	Colorizing a given gray-level image is an important task in the media and advertising industry. Due to the ambiguity inherent to colorization (many shades are often plausible), recent approaches started to explicitly model diversity. However, one of the most obvious artifacts, structural inconsistency, is rarely considered by existing methods which predict chrominance independently for every pixel. To address this issue, we develop a conditional random field based variational auto-encoder formulation which is able to achieve diversity while taking into account structural consistency. Moreover, we introduce a controllability mecha- nism that can incorporate external constraints from diverse sources in- cluding a user interface. Compared to existing baselines, we demonstrate that our method obtains more diverse and globally consistent coloriza- tions on the LFW, LSUN-Church and ILSVRC-2015 datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Safa_Messaoud_Structural_Consistency_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Safa Messaoud, David Forsyth, Alexander G.

Decouple Learning for Parameterized Image Operators	"Many different deep networks have been used to approximate, accelerate or improve traditional image operators, such as image smoothing, super-resolution and denoising. Among these traditional operators, many contain parameters which need to be tweaked to obtain the satisfactory results, which we refer to as ""parameterized image operators''. However, most existing deep networks trained for these operators are only designed for one specific parameter configuration, which does not meet the needs of real scenarios that usually require flexible parameters settings. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new decouple learning algorithm to learn from the operator parameters to dynamically adjust the weights of a deep network for image operators, denoted as the base network. The learned algorithm is formed as another network, namely the weight learning network, which can be end-to-end jointly trained with the base network. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can be successfully applied to many traditional parameterized image operators. We provide more analysis to better understand the proposed framework, which may inspire more promising research in this direction. Our codes and models have been released in https://github.com/fqnchina/DecoupleLearning."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Qingnan_Fan_Learning_to_Learn_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Qingnan Fan, Dongdong Chen, Lu Yuan, Gang Hua, Nenghai Yu, Baoquan Chen
Semantic Match Consistency for Long-Term Visual Localization	Robust and accurate visual localization across large appearance variations due to changes in time of day, seasons, or changes of the environment is a challenging problem which is of importance to application areas such as navigation of autonomous robots. Traditional feature-based methods often struggle in these conditions due to the significant number of erroneous matches between the image and the 3D model. In this paper, we present a method for scoring the individual correspondences by exploiting semantic information about the query image and the scene. In this way, erroneous correspondences tend to get a low semantic consistency score, whereas correct correspondences tend to get a high score. By incorporating this information in a standard localization pipeline, we show that the localization performance can be significantly improved compared to the state-of-the-art, as evaluated on two challenging long-term localization benchmarks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Carl_Toft_Semantic_Match_Consistency_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Carl Toft, Erik Stenborg, Lars Hammarstrand, Lucas Brynte, Marc Pollefeys, Torsten Sattler, Fredrik Kahl
Deep Directional Statistics: Pose Estimation with Uncertainty Quantification	Modern deep learning systems successfully solve many perception tasks such as object pose estimation when the input image is of high quality. However, in challenging imaging conditions such as on low resolution images or when the image is corrupted by imaging artifacts, current systems degrade considerably in accuracy. While a loss in performance is unavoidable we would like our models to quantify their uncertainty in order to achieve robustness against images of varying quality. Probabilistic deep learning models combine the expressive power of deep learning with uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic deep learning model for the task of angular regression. Our model uses von Mises distributions to predict a distribution over object pose angle. Whereas a single von Mises distribution is making strong assumptions about the shape of the distribution, we extend the basic model to predict a mixture of von Mises distributions. We show how to learn a mixture model using a finite and infinite number of mixture components. Our model allow for likelihood-based training and efficient inference at test time. We demonstrate on a number of challenging pose estimation datasets that our model produces calibrated probability predictions and competitive or superior point estimates compared to the current state-of-the-art.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Sergey_Prokudin_Deep_Directional_Statistics_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Sergey Prokudin, Peter Gehler , Sebastian Nowozin
Deep Metric Learning with Hierarchical Triplet Loss	We present a novel hierarchical triplet loss (HTL) capable of automatically collecting informative training samples (triplets) via a defined hierarchical tree that encodes global context information. This allows us to cope with the main limitation of random sampling in training a conventional triplet loss, which is a central issue for deep metric learning. Our main contributions are two-fold. (i) we construct a hierarchical class-level tree where neighboring classes are merged recursively. The hierarchical structure naturally captures the intrinsic data distribution over the whole dataset. (ii) we formulate the problem of triplet collection by introducing a new violate margin, which is computed dynamically based on the designed hierarchical tree. This allows it to automatically select meaningful hard samples with the guide of global context. It encourages the model to learn more discriminative features from visual similar classes, leading to faster convergence and better performance. In addition, the proposed HTL is easily implemented, and the new violate margin can be readily integrated into the standard triplet loss and other deep metric learning functions. Our method is evaluated on the tasks of image retrieval and face recognition, where it can obtain comparable performance with much fewer iterations. It outperforms the standard triplet loss substantially by 1% - 18%, and achieves new state-of-the-art performance on a number of benchmarks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ge_Deep_Metric_Learning_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Weifeng Ge
ArticulatedFusion: Real-time Reconstruction of Motion, Geometry and Segmentation Using a Single Depth Camera	This paper proposes a real-time dynamic scene reconstruction method capable of reproducing the motion, geometry, and segmentation simultaneously given live depth stream from a single RGB-D camera. Our approach fuses geometry frame by frame and uses a segmentation-enhanced node graph structure to drive the deformation of geometry in registration step. A two-level node motion optimization is proposed. The optimization space of node motions and the range of physically-plausible deformations are largely reduced by taking advantage of the articulated motion prior, which is solved by an efficient node graph segmentation method. Compared to previous fusion-based dynamic scene reconstruction methods, our experiments show robust and improved reconstruction results for tangential and occluded motions.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chao_Li_ArticulatedFusion_Real-time_Reconstruction_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chao Li, Zheheng Zhao, Xiaohu Guo
Reinforced Temporal Attention and Split-Rate Transfer for Depth-Based Person Re-Identification	We address the problem of person re-identification from commodity depth sensors. One challenge for depth-based recognition is data scarcity. Our first contribution addresses this problem by introducing split-rate RGB-to-Depth transfer, which leverages large RGB datasets more effectively than popular fine-tuning approaches. Our transfer scheme is based on the observation that the model parameters at the bottom layers of a deep convolutional neural network can be directly shared between RGB and depth data while the remaining layers need to be fine-tuned rapidly. Our second contribution enhances re-identification for video by implementing temporal attention as a Bernoulli-Sigmoid unit acting upon frame-level features. Since this unit is stochastic, the temporal attention parameters are trained using reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments validate the accuracy of our method in person re-identification from depth sequences. Finally, in a scenario where subjects wear unseen clothes, we show large performance gains compared to a state-of-the-art model which relies on RGB data.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Nikolaos_Karianakis_Reinforced_Temporal_Attention_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Nikolaos Karianakis, Zicheng Liu, Yinpeng Chen, Stefano Soatto
Interpretable Basis Decomposition for Visual Explanation	Explanations of the decisions made by a deep neural network are important for human end-users to be able to understand and diagnose the trustworthiness of the system. Current neural networks used for visual recognition are generally used as black boxes that do not provide any human interpretable justification for a prediction. In this work we propose a new framework called Interpretable Basis Decomposition for providing visual explanations for classification networks. By decomposing the neural activations of the input image into semantically interpretable components pre-trained from a large concept corpus, the proposed framework is able to disentangle the evidence encoded in the activation feature vector, and quantify the contribution of each piece of evidence to the final prediction. We apply our framework for providing explanations to several popular networks for visual recognition, and show it is able to explain the predictions given by the networks in human-interpretable way. The human interpretability of the visual explanations provided by our framework and other recent explanation methods is evaluated through Amazon Mechanical Turk, showing that our framework generates more faithful and interpretable explanations.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Antonio_Torralba_Interpretable_Basis_Decomposition_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Bolei Zhou, Yiyou Sun, David Bau, Antonio Torralba
Graph R-CNN for Scene Graph Generation	We propose a novel scene graph generation model called Graph R-CNN, that is both effective and efficient at detecting objects and their relations in images. Our model contains a Relation Proposal Network (RePN) that efficiently deals with the quadratic number of potential relations between objects in an image. We also propose an attentional Graph Convolutional Network (aGCN) that effectively captures contextual information between objects and relations. Finally, we introduce a novel scene graph evaluation metric that is more holistic and realistic than existing metrics. We report state-of-the-art performance on scene graph generation as evaluated using both existing and our proposed metrics.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jianwei_Yang_Graph_R-CNN_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jianwei Yang, Jiasen Lu, Stefan Lee, Dhruv Batra, Devi Parikh
GANimation: Anatomically-aware Facial Animation from a Single Image	Recent advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown impressive results for task of facial expression synthesis. The most successful architecture is StarGAN, that conditions GANs' generation process with images of a specific domain, namely a set of images of persons sharing the same expression. While effective, this approach can only generate a discrete number of expressions, determined by the content of the dataset. To address this limitation, in this paper, we introduce a novel GAN conditioning scheme based on Action Units (AU) annotations, which describes in a continuous manifold the anatomical facial movements defining a human expression. Our approach allows controlling the magnitude of activation of each AU and combine several of them. Additionally, we propose a fully unsupervised strategy to train the model, that only requires images annotated with their activated AUs, and exploit attention mechanisms that make our network robust to changing backgrounds and lighting conditions. Extensive evaluation show that our approach goes beyond competing conditional generators both in the capability to synthesize a much wider range of expressions ruled by anatomically feasible muscle movements, as in the capacity of dealing with images in the wild.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Albert_Pumarola_Anatomically_Coherent_Facial_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Albert Pumarola, Antonio Agudo, Aleix M.

A Segmentation-aware Deep Fusion Network for Compressed Sensing MRI	"Compressed sensing MRI is a classic inverse problem in the field of computational imaging, accelerating the MR imaging by measuring less k-space data. The deep neural network models provide the stronger representation ability and faster reconstruction compared with ""shallow"" optimization-based methods. However, in the existing deep-based CS-MRI models, the high-level semantic supervision information from massive segmentation-labels in MRI dataset is overlooked. In this paper, we proposed a segmentation-aware deep fusion network called SADFN for compressed sensing MRI. The multilayer feature aggregation (MLFA) method is introduced here to fuse all the features from different layers in the segmentation network. Then, the aggregated feature maps containing semantic information are provided to each layer in the reconstruction network with a feature fusion strategy. This guarantees the reconstruction network is aware of the different regions in the image it reconstructs, simplifying the function mapping. We prove the utility of the cross-layer and cross-task information fusion strategy by comparative study. Extensive experiments on brain segmentation benchmark MRBrainS validated that the proposed SADFN model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in compressed sensing MRI. This paper provides a novel approach to guide the low-level visual task using the information from mid- or high-level task."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhiwen_Fan_A_Segmentation-aware_Deep_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhiwen Fan, Liyan Sun, Xinghao Ding, Yue Huang, Congbo Cai, John Paisley
Transferable Adversarial Perturbations	State-of-the-art deep neural network classifiers are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples which are designed to mislead classifiers with a very small perturbation. However, the performance of black-box attacks (without knowledge of the model parameters) against deployed models always degrades significantly. In this paper, We propose a novel way of perturbations for adversarial examples to enable black-box transfer. We first show that maximizing distance between natural images and their adversarial examples in the intermediate feature maps can improve both white-box attacks (with knowledge of the model parameters) and black-box attacks. We also show that smooth regularization on adversarial perturbations enables transferring across models. Extensive experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods both in white-box and black-box attacks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Bruce_Hou_Transferable_Adversarial_Perturbations_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Wen Zhou, Xin Hou, Yongjun Chen, Mengyun Tang, Xiangqi Huang, Xiang Gan, Yong Yang
Video Object Segmentation by Learning Location-Sensitive Embeddings	We address the problem of video object segmentation which outputs the masks of a target object throughout a video given only a bounding box in the first frame. There are two main challenges for this task. First, the background may contain similar objects as the target. Second, the appearance of the target object may change drastically over time. To tackle these challenges, we propose an end-to-end training network which accomplishes foreground predictions by leveraging the location-sensitive embeddings which are capable to distinguish the pixels of similar objects. To deal with appearance changes, for a test video, we propose a robust model adaptation method which pre-scans the whole video, generates pseudo foreground/background labels and retrains the model based on the labels. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the DAVIS and the SegTrack V2 datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hai_Ci_Video_Object_Segmentation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hai Ci, Chunyu Wang, Yizhou Wang
Facial Dynamics Interpreter Network: What are the Important Relations between Local Dynamics for Facial Trait Estimation?	Human face analysis is an important task in computer vision. According to cognitive-psychological studies, facial dynamics could provide crucial cues for face analysis. The motion of a facial local region in facial expression is related to the motion of other facial local regions. In this paper, a novel deep learning approach has been proposed to interpret the important relations between local dynamics for estimating facial traits from expression sequence. The facial dynamics interpreter network is designed to be able to encode a relational importance, which is used for interpreting the relation between facial local dynamics and estimating facial traits. By comparative experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated. The important relations between facial local dynamics are interpreted by the proposed method in gender classification and age estimation. Moreover, experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in gender classification and age estimation.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Seong_Tae_Kim_Facial_Dynamics_Interpreter_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Seong Tae Kim, Yong Man Ro
DetNet: Design Backbone for Object Detection	Recent CNN based object detectors, either one-stage methods like YOLO, SSD, and RetinaNet, or two-stage detectors like Faster R-CNN, R-FCN and FPN, are usually trying to directly finetune from ImageNet pre-trained models designed for the task of image classification. However, there has been little work discussing the backbone feature extractor specifically designed for the task of object detection. More importantly, there are several differences between the tasks of image classification and object detection. (1) Recent object detectors like FPN and RetinaNet usually involve extra stages against the task of image classification to handle the objects with various scales. (2) Object detection not only needs to recognize the category of the object instances but also spatially locate them. Large downsampling factors bring large valid receptive field, which is good for image classification but compromises the object location ability. Due to the gap between the image classification and object detection, we propose DetNet in this paper, which is a novel backbone network specifically designed for object detection. Moreover, DetNet includes the extra stages against traditional backbone network for image classification, while maintains high spatial resolution in deeper layers. Without any bells and whistles, state-of-the-art results have been obtained for both object detection and instance segmentation on the MSCOCO benchmark based on our DetNet~(4.8G FLOPs) backbone. Codes will be released.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zeming_Li_DetNet_Design_Backbone_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zeming Li, Chao Peng, Gang Yu, Xiangyu Zhang, Yangdong Deng, Jian Sun
Saliency Detection in 360° Videos	This paper presents a novel spherical convolutional neural network based scheme for saliency detection for 360° videos. Specifically, in our spherical convolution neural network definition, kernel is defined on a spherical crown, and the convolution involves the rotation of the kernel along the sphere. Considering that the 360° videos are usually stored with equirectangular panorama, we propose to implement the spherical convolution on panorama by stretching and rotating the kernel based on the location of patch to be convolved. Compared with existing spherical convolution, our definition has the parameter sharing property, which would greatly reduce the parameters to be learned. We further take the temporal coherence of the viewing process into consideration, and propose a sequential saliency detection by leveraging a spherical U-Net. To validate our approach, we construct a large-scale 360° videos saliency detection benchmark that consists of 104 360° videos viewed by 20+ human subjects. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our spherical U-net for 360° video saliency detection.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ziheng_Zhang_Saliency_Detection_in_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ziheng Zhang, Yanyu Xu, Jingyi Yu, Shenghua Gao
Scenes-Objects-Actions: A Multi-Task, Multi-Label Video Dataset	"This paper introduces a large-scale, multi-label and multitask video dataset named Scenes-Objects-Actions (SOA). Most prior video datasets are based on a predened taxonomy, which is used to de- ne the keyword queries issued to search engines. The videos retrieved by the search engines are then veried for correctness by human annotators. Datasets collected in this manner tend to generate high classication accuracy as search engines typically rank easy"" videos rst. The SOA dataset adopts a dierent approach. We rely on uniform sampling to get a better representations of videos on the Web. Trained annotators are asked to provide free-form text labels describing each video in three dierent aspects: scene, object and action. These raw labels are then merged, split and renamed to generate a taxonomy for SOA. All the annotations are veried again based on the taxonomy. The nal dataset includes 562K videos with 3.64M annotations spanning 49 categories for scenes, 356 for objects, and 148 for actions. We show that datasets collected in this way are quite challenging by evaluating existing popular video models on SOA. We provide in-depth analysis about the performance of dierent models on SOA, and highlight potential new directions in video classication. A key-feature of SOA is that it enables the empirical study of correlation among scene, object and action recognition in video. We present results of this study and further analyze the potential of using the information learned from one task to improve the others. We compare SOA with existing datasets in the context of transfer learning and demonstrate that pre-training on SOA consistently improves the accuracy on a wide variety of datasets. We believe that the challenges presented by SOA oer the opportunity for further advancement in video analysis as we progress from single-label classication towards a more comprehensive understanding of video data."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Heng_Wang_Scenes-Objects-Actions_A_Multi-Task_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jamie Ray, Heng Wang, Du Tran, Yufei Wang, Matt Feiszli, Lorenzo Torresani, Manohar Paluri
Contour Knowledge Transfer for Salient Object Detection	In recent years, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have broken all records in salient object detection. However, training such a deep model requires a large amount of manual annotations. Our goal is to overcome this limitation by automatically converting an existing deep contour detection model into a salient object detection model without using any manual salient object masks. For this purpose, we have created a deep network architecture, namely Contour-to-Saliency Network (C2S-Net), by grafting a new branch onto a well-trained contour detection network. Therefore, our C2S-Net has two branches for performing two different tasks: 1) predicting contours with the original contour branch, and 2) estimating per-pixel saliency score of each image with the newly-added saliency branch. To bridge the gap between these two tasks, we further propose a contour-to-saliency transferring method to automatically generate salient object masks which can be used to train the saliency branch from outputs of the contour branch. Finally, we introduce a novel alternating training pipeline to gradually update the network parameters. In this scheme, the contour branch generates saliency masks for training the saliency branch, while the saliency branch, in turn, feeds back saliency knowledge in the form of saliency-aware contour labels, for fine-tuning the contour branch. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five well-known benchmarks, outperforming existing fully supervised methods while also maintaining high efficiency.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xin_Li_Contour_Knowledge_Transfer_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xin Li, Fan Yang, Hong Cheng, Wei Liu, Dinggang Shen
SketchyScene: Richly-Annotated Scene Sketches	We contribute the rst large-scale dataset of scene sketches, SketchyScene, with the goal of advancing research on sketch understanding at both the object and scene level. The dataset is created through a novel and carefully designed crowdsourcing pipeline, enabling users to eciently generate large quantities realistic and diverse scene sketches.

DPP-Net: Device-aware Progressive Search for Pareto-optimal Neural Architectures	Recent breakthroughs in Neural Architectural Search (NAS) have achieved state-of-the-art performances in applications such as image classification and language modeling. However, these techniques typically ignore device-related objectives such as inference time, memory usage, and power consumption. Optimizing neural architecture for device-related objectives is immensely crucial for deploying deep networks on portable devices with limited computing resources. We propose DPP-Net: Device-aware Progressive Search for Pareto-optimal Neural Architectures, optimizing for both device-related (e.g., inference time and memory usage) and device-agnostic (e.g., accuracy and model size) objectives. DPP-Net employs a compact search space inspired by current state-of-the-art mobile CNNs, and further improves search efficiency by adopting progressive search (Liu et al. 2017). Experimental results on CIFAR-10 are poised to demonstrate the effectiveness of Pareto-optimal networks found by DPP-Net, for three different devices: (1) a workstation with Titan X GPU, (2) NVIDIA Jetson TX1 embedded system, and (3) mobile phone with ARM Cortex-A53. Compared to CondenseNet and NASNet (Mobile), DPP-Net achieves better performances: higher accuracy and shorter inference time on various devices. Additional experimental results show that models found by DPP-Net also achieve considerably-good performance on ImageNet as well.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jin-Dong_Dong_DPP-Net_Device-aware_Progressive_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jin-Dong Dong, An-Chieh Cheng, Da-Cheng Juan, Wei Wei, Min Sun
Perturbation Robust Representations of Topological Persistence Diagrams	Topological methods for data analysis present opportunities for enforcing certain invariances of broad interest in computer vision, including view-point in activity analysis, articulation in shape analysis, and measurement invariance in non-linear dynamical modeling. The increasing success of these methods is attributed to the complementary information that topology provides, as well as availability of tools for computing topological summaries such as persistence diagrams. However, persistence diagrams are multi-sets of points and hence it is not straightforward to fuse them with features used for contemporary machine learning tools like deep-nets. In this paper we present theoretically well-grounded approaches to develop novel perturbation robust topological representations, with the long-term view of making them amenable to fusion with contemporary learning architectures. We term the proposed representation as Perturbed Topological Signatures, which live on a Grassmann manifold and hence can be efficiently used in machine learning pipelines. We explore the use of the proposed descriptor on three applications: 3D shape analysis, view-invariant activity analysis, and non-linear dynamical modeling. We show favorable results in both high-level recognition performance and time-complexity when compared to other baseline methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Anirudh_Som_Perturbation_Robust_Representations_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Anirudh Som, Kowshik Thopalli, Karthikeyan Natesan Ramamurthy, Vinay Venkataraman, Ankita Shukla, Pavan Turaga
Fictitious GAN: Training GANs with Historical Models	Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are powerful tools for learning generative models. In practice, the training may suffer from lack of convergence. GANs are commonly viewed as a two-player zero-sum game between two neural networks. Here, we leverage this game theoretic view to study the convergence behavior of the training process. Inspired by the fictitious play learning process, a novel training method, referred to as Fictitious GAN, is introduced. Fictitious GAN trains the deep neural networks using a mixture of historical models. Specifically, the discriminator (resp. generator) is updated according to the best-response to the mixture outputs from a sequence of previously trained generators (resp. discriminators). It is shown that Fictitious GAN can effectively resolve some convergence issues that cannot be resolved by the standard training approach. It is proved that asymptotically the average of the generator outputs has the same distribution as the data samples.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yin_Xia_Fictitious_GAN_Training_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hao Ge, Yin Xia, Xu Chen, Randall Berry, Ying Wu
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation via Class-Balanced Self-Training	"Recent deep networks achieved state of the art performanceon a variety of semantic segmentation tasks. Despite such progress, thesemodels often face challenges in real world ""wild tasks"" where large differ-ence between labeled training/source data and unseen test/target dataexists. In particular, such difference is often referred to as ""domain gap"",and could cause significantly decreased performance which cannot beeasily remedied by further increasing the representation power. Unsuper-vised domain adaptation (UDA) seeks to overcome such problem withouttarget domain labels. In this paper, we propose a novel UDA frameworkbased on an iterative self-training (ST) procedure, where the problemis formulated as latent variable loss minimization, and can be solved byalternatively generating pseudo labels on target data and re-training themodel with these labels. On top of ST, we also propose a novel class-balanced self-training (CBST) framework to avoid the gradual domi-nance of large classes on pseudo-label generation, and introduce spatialpriors to refine generated labels. Comprehensive experiments show thatthe proposed methods achieve state of the art semantic segmentationperformance under multiple major UDA settings."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yang_Zou_Unsupervised_Domain_Adaptation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yang Zou, Zhiding Yu, B.V.K.

AugGAN: Cross Domain Adaptation with GAN-based Data Augmentation	Deep learning based image-to-image translation methods aim at learning the joint distribution of the two domains and finding transformations between them. Despite recent GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) based methods have shown compelling visual results, they are prone to fail at preserving image-objects and maintaining translation consistency when faced with large and complex domain shifts, which reduces their practicality on tasks such as generating large-scale training data for different domains. To address this problem, we purpose a weakly supervised structure-aware image-to-image translation network, which is composed of encoders, generators, discriminators and parsing nets for the two domains, respectively, in a unified framework. The purposed network generates more visually plausible images of a different domain compared to the competing methods on different image-translation tasks. In addition, we quantitatively evaluate different methods by training Faster-RCNN and YOLO with datasets generated from the image-translation results and demonstrate significant improvement of the detection accuracies by using the proposed image-object preserving network.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Sheng-Wei_Huang_AugGAN_Cross_Domain_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Sheng-Wei Huang, Che-Tsung Lin, Shu-Ping Chen, Yen-Yi Wu, Po-Hao Hsu, Shang-Hong Lai
Semantically Aware Urban 3D Reconstruction with Plane-Based Regularization	We propose a method for urban 3D reconstruction, which incorporates semantic information and plane priors within the reconstruction process in order to generate visually appealing 3D models. We introduce a plane detection algorithm using 3D lines, which detects a more complete and less spurious plane set compared to point-based methods in urban environments. Further, the proposed normalized visibility-based energy formulation eases the combination of several energy terms within a tetrahedra occupancy labeling algorithm and, hence, is well suited for combining it with class specific smoothness terms. As a result, we produce visually appealing and detailed building models (i.e., straight edges and planar surfaces) and a smooth reconstruction of the surroundings.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Thomas_Holzmann_Semantically_Aware_Urban_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Thomas Holzmann, Michael Maurer, Friedrich Fraundorfer, Horst Bischof
Pivot Correlational Neural Network for Multimodal Video Categorization	This paper considers an architecture for multimodal video categorization referred to as Pivot Correlational Neural Network (Pivot CorrNN). The architecture is trained to maximizes the correlation between the hidden states as well as the predictions of the modal-agnostic pivot stream and modal-specific stream in the network. Here, the modal-agnostic pivot hidden state considers all modal inputs without distinction while the modal-specific hidden state is dedicated exclusively to one specific modal input. The Pivot CorrNN consists of three modules: (1) maximizing pivot-correlation module that attempts to maximally correlate the modal-agnostic and a modal-specific hidden-state as well as their predictions, (2) contextual Gated Recurrent Unit (cGRU) module which extends the capability of a generic GRU to take multimodal inputs in updating the pivot hidden-state, and (3) adaptive aggregation module that aggregates all modal-specific predictions as well as the modal-agnostic pivot predictions into one final prediction. We evaluate the Pivot CorrNN on two publicly available large-scale multimodal video categorization datasets, FCVID and YouTube-8M. From the experimental results, Pivot CorrNN achieves the best performance on the FCVID database and performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on YouTube-8M database.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Sunghun_Kang_Pivot_Correlational_Neural_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Sunghun Kang, Junyeong Kim, Hyunsoo Choi, Sungjin Kim, Chang D.

Macro-Micro Adversarial Network for Human Parsing	In human parsing, the pixel-wise classification loss has drawbacks in its low-level local inconsistency and high-level semantic inconsistency. The introduction of the adversarial network tackles the two problems using a single discriminator. However, the two types of parsing inconsistency are generated by distinct mechanisms, so it is difficult for a single discriminator to solve them both. To address the two kinds of inconsistencies, this paper proposes the Macro-Micro Adversarial Net (MMAN). It has two discriminators. One discriminator, Macro D, acts on the low-resolution label map and penalizes semantic inconsistency, e.g., misplaced body parts. The other discriminator, Micro D, focuses on multiple patches of the high-resolution label map to address the local inconsistency, e.g., blur and hole. Compared with traditional adversarial networks, MMAN not only enforces local and semantic consistency explicitly, but also avoids the poor convergence problem of adversarial networks when handling high resolution images. In our experiment, we validate that the two discriminators are complementary to each other in improving the human parsing accuracy. The proposed framework is capable of producing competitive parsing performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, i.e., mIoU=46.81% and 59.91% on LIP and PASCAL-Person-Part, respectively. On a relatively small dataset PPSS, our pre-trained model demonstrates impressive generalization ability.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yawei_Luo_Macro-Micro_Adversarial_Network_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yawei Luo, Zhedong Zheng, Liang Zheng, Tao Guan, Junqing Yu, Yi Yang
HybridFusion: Real-Time Performance Capture Using a Single Depth Sensor and Sparse IMUs	We propose a light-weight and highly robust real-time human performance capture method based on a single depth camera and sparse inertial measurement units (IMUs). The proposed method combines non-rigid surface tracking and volumetric surface fusion to simultaneously reconstruct challenging motions, detailed geometries and the inner human body shapes of a clothed subject. The proposed hybrid motion tracking algorithm and efficient per-frame sensor calibration technique enable non-rigid surface reconstruction for fast motions and challenging poses with severe occlusions. Significant fusion artifacts are reduced using a new confidence measurement for our adaptive TSDF-based fusion. The above contributions benefit each other in our real-time reconstruction system, which enable practical human performance capture that is real-time, robust, low-cost and easy to deploy. Our experiments show how extremely challenging performances and loop closure problems can be handled successfully.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zerong_Zheng_HybridFusion_Real-Time_Performance_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zerong Zheng, Tao Yu, Hao Li, Kaiwen Guo, Qionghai Dai, Lu Fang, Yebin Liu
Multiple-gaze geometry: Inferring novel 3D locations from gazes observed in monocular video	We develop using person gaze direction for scene understanding. In particular, we use intersecting gazes to learn 3D locations that people tend to look at, which is analogous to having multiple camera views. The 3D locations that we discover need not be visible to the camera. Conversely, knowing 3D locations of scene elements that draw visual attention, such as other people in the scene, can help infer gaze direction. We provide a Bayesian generative model for the temporal scene that captures the joint probability of camera parameters, locations of people, their gaze, what they are looking at, and locations of visual attention. Both the number of people in the scene and the number of extra objects that draw attention are unknown and need to be inferred. To execute this joint inference we use a probabilistic data association approach that enables principled comparison of model hypotheses. We use MCMC for inference over the discrete correspondence variables, and approximate the marginalization over continuous parameters using the Metropolis-Laplace approximation, using Hamiltonian (Hybrid) Monte Carlo for maximization. As existing data sets do not provide the 3D locations of what people are looking at, we contribute a small data set that does. On this data set, we infer what people are looking at with 59% precision compared with 13% for a baseline approach, and where those objects are within about 0.58m.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ernesto_Brau_Stereo_gaze_Inferring_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ernesto Brau, Jinyan Guan, Tanya Jeffries, Kobus Barnard
Multi-Scale Context Intertwining for Semantic Segmentation	Accurate semantic image segmentation requires the joint consideration of local appearance, semantic information, and global scene context. In today's age of pre-trained deep networks and their powerful convolutional features, state-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches differ mostly in how they choose to combine together these different kinds of information. In this work, we propose a novel scheme for aggregating features from different scales, which we refer to as Multi-Scale Context Intertwining (MSCI). In contrast to previous approaches, which typically propagate information between scales in a one-directional manner, we merge pairs of feature maps in a bidirectional and recurrent fashion, via connections between two LSTM chains. By training the parameters of the LSTM units on the segmentation task, the above approach learns how to extract powerful and effective features for pixel-level semantic segmentation, which are then combined hierarchically. Furthermore, rather than using fixed information propagation routes, we subdivide images into super-pixels, and use the spatial relationship between them in order to perform image-adapted context aggregation. Our extensive evaluation on public benchmarks indicates that all of the aforementioned components of our approach increase the effectiveness of information propagation throughout the network, and significantly improve its eventual segmentation accuracy.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Di_Lin_Multi-Scale_Context_Intertwining_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Di Lin, Yuanfeng Ji, Dani Lischinski, Daniel Cohen-Or, Hui Huang
Task-driven Webpage Saliency	In this paper, we present an end-to-end learning framework for predicting task-driven visual saliency on webpages. Given a webpage, we propose a convolutional neural network to predict where people look at it under different task conditions. Inspired by the observation that given a specific task, human attention is strongly correlated with certain semantic components on a webpage (e.g., images, buttons and input boxes), our network explicitly disentangles saliency prediction into two independent sub-tasks: task-specific attention shift prediction and task-free saliency prediction. The task-specific branch estimates task-driven attention shift over a webpage from its semantic components, while the task-free branch infers visual saliency induced by visual features of the webpage. The outputs of the two branches are combined to produce the final prediction. Such a task decomposition framework allows us to efficiently learn our model from a small-scale task-driven saliency dataset with sparse labels (captured under a single task condition). Experimental results show that our method outperforms the baselines and prior works, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a newly collected benchmark dataset for task-driven webpage saliency detection.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Quanlong_Zheng_Task-driven_Webpage_Saliency_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Quanlong Zheng, Jianbo Jiao, Ying Cao, Rynson W.H.

Efficient Semantic Scene Completion Network with Spatial Group Convolution	We introduce Spatial Group Convolution (SGC) for accelerating the computation of 3D dense prediction tasks. SGC is orthogonal to group convolution, which works on spatial dimensions rather than feature channel dimension. It divides input voxels into different groups, then conducts 3D sparse convolution on these separated groups. As only valid voxels are considered when performing convolution, computation can be significantly reduced with a slight loss of accuracy. The proposed operations are validated on semantic scene completion task, which aims to predict a complete 3D volume with semantic labels from a single depth image. With SGC, we further present an efficient 3D sparse convolutional network, which harnesses a multiscale architecture and a coarse-to-fine prediction strategy. Evaluations are conducted on the SUNCG dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance and fast speed.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jiahui_Zhang_Efficient_Semantic_Scene_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jiahui Zhang, Hao Zhao, Anbang Yao, Yurong Chen, Li Zhang, Hongen Liao
Diagnosing Error in Temporal Action Detectors	Despite the recent progress in video understanding and the continuous rate of improvement in temporal action localization throughout the years, it is still unclear how far (or close?) we are to solving the problem. To this end, we introduce a new diagnostic tool to analyze the performance of temporal action detectors in videos and compare different methods beyond a single scalar metric. We exemplify the use of our tool by analyzing the performance of the top rewarded entries in the latest ActivityNet action localization challenge. Our analysis shows that the most impactful areas to work on are: strategies to better handle temporal context around the instances, improving the robustness w.r.t. the instance absolute and relative size, and strategies to reduce the localization errors. Moreover, our experimental analysis finds the lack of agreement among annotator is not a major roadblock to attain progress in the field. Our diagnostic tool is publicly available to keep fueling the minds of other researchers with additional insights about their algorithms.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Humam_Alwassel_Diagnosing_Error_in_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Humam Alwassel, Fabian Caba Heilbron, Victor Escorcia, Bernard Ghanem
Exploring Visual Relationship for Image Captioning	It is always well believed that modeling relationships between objects would be helpful for representing and eventually describing an image. Nevertheless, there has not been evidence in support of the idea on image description generation. In this paper, we introduce a new design to explore the connections between objects for image captioning under the umbrella of attention-based encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, we present Graph Convolutional Networks plus Long Short-Term Memory (dubbed as GCN-LSTM) architecture that novelly integrates both semantic and spatial object relationships into image encoder. Technically, we build graphs over the detected objects in an image based on their spatial and semantic connections. The representations of each region proposed on objects are then refined by leveraging graph structure through GCN. With the learnt region-level features, our GCN-LSTM capitalizes on LSTM-based captioning framework with attention mechanism for sentence generation. Extensive experiments are conducted on COCO image captioning dataset, and superior results are reported when comparing to state-of-the-art approaches. More remarkably, GCN-LSTM increases CIDEr-D performance from 120.1% to 128.7% on COCO testing set.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ting_Yao_Exploring_Visual_Relationship_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ting Yao, Yingwei Pan, Yehao Li, Tao Mei
MaskConnect: Connectivity Learning by Gradient Descent	Although deep networks have recently emerged as the model of choice for many computer vision problems, in order to yield good results they often require time-consuming architecture search. To combat the complexity of design choices, prior work has adopted the principle of modularized design which consists in defining the network in terms of a composition of topologically identical or similar building blocks (a.k.a. modules). This reduces architecture search to the problem of determining the number of modules to compose and how to connect such modules. Again, for reasons of design complexity and training cost, previous approaches have relied on simple rules of connectivity, e.g., connecting each module to only the immediately preceding module or perhaps to all of the previous ones. Such simple connectivity rules are unlikely to yield the optimal architecture for the given problem. In this work we remove these predefined choices and propose an algorithm to learn the connections between modules in the network. Instead of being chosen a priori by the human designer, the connectivity is learned simultaneously with the weights of the network by optimizing the loss function of the end task using a modified version of gradient descent. We demonstrate our connectivity learning method on the problem of multi-class image classification using two popular architectures: ResNet and ResNeXt. Experiments on four different datasets show that connectivity learning using our approach yields consistently higher accuracy compared to relying on traditional predefined rules of connectivity. Furthermore, in certain settings it leads to significant savings in number of parameters.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Karim_Ahmed_MaskConnect_Connectivity_Learning_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Karim Ahmed, Lorenzo Torresani
Understanding Perceptual and Conceptual Fluency at a Large Scale	We create a dataset of 543,758 logo designs spanning 39 industrial categories and 216 countries. We experiment and compare how different deep convolutional neural network (hereafter, DCNN) architectures, pretraining protocols, and weight initializations perform in predicting design memorability and likability. We propose and provide estimation methods based on training DCNNs to extract and evaluate two independent constructs for designs: perceptual distinctiveness (``perceptual fluency'' metrics) and ambiguity in meaning (``conceptual fluency'' metrics) of each logo. We provide evidences of causal inference that both constructs significantly affect memory for a logo design, consistent with cognitive elaboration theory. The effect on liking, however, is interactive, consistent with processing fluency (e.g., Lee and Labroo (2004), Landwehr et al. (2011).	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Meredith_Hu_Understanding_Perceptual_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Shengli Hu, Ali Borji
Boosted Attention: Leveraging Human Attention for Image Captioning	Visual attention has shown usefulness in image captioning, with the goal of enabling a caption model to selectively focus on regions of interest. Existing models typically rely on top-down language information and learn attention implicitly by optimizing the captioning objectives. While somewhat effective, the learned top-down attention can fail to focus on correct regions of interest without direct supervision of attention. Inspired by the human visual system which is driven by not only the task-specific top-down signals but also the visual stimuli, we in this work propose to use both types of attention for image captioning. In particular, we highlight the complementary nature of the two types of attention and develop a model (Boosted Attention) to integrate them for image captioning. We validate the proposed approach with state-of-the-art performance across various evaluation metrics.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Shi_Chen_Boosted_Attention_Leveraging_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Shi Chen, Qi Zhao
Constraint-Aware Deep Neural Network Compression	Deep neural network compression has the potential to bring modern resource-hungry deep networks to resource-limited devices. However, in many of the most compelling deployment scenarios of compressed deep networks, the operational constraints matter: for example, a pedestrian detection network on a self-driving car may have to satisfy a latency constraint for safe operation. We propose the first principled treatment of deep network compression under operational constraints. We formulate the compression learning problem from the perspective of constrained Bayesian optimization, and introduce a cooling (annealing) strategy to guide the network compression towards the target constraints. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate the value of modelling constraints directly in network compression.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Changan_Chen_Constraints_Matter_in_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Changan Chen, Frederick Tung, Naveen Vedula, Greg Mori
Good Line Cutting: towards Accurate Pose Tracking of Line-assisted VO/VSLAM	This paper tackles a problem in line-assisted VO/VSLAM: accurately solving the least squares pose optimization with unreliable 3D line input. The solution we present is good line cutting, which extracts the most-informative sub-segment from each 3D line for use within the pose optimization formulation. By studying the impact of line cutting towards the information gain of pose estimation in line-based least squares problem, we demonstrate the applicability of improving pose estimation accuracy with good line cutting. To that end, we describe an efficient algorithm that approximately approaches the joint optimization problem of good line cutting. The proposed algorithm is integrated into a state-of-the-art line-assisted VSLAM system. When evaluated in two target scenarios of line-assisted VO/VSLAM, low-texture and motion blur, the accuracy of pose tracking is improved, while the robustness is preserved.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yipu_Zhao_Good_Line_Cutting_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yipu Zhao, Patricio A.

Deep Image Demosaicking using a Cascade of Convolutional Residual Denoising Networks	Demosaicking and denoising are among the most crucial steps of modern digital camera pipelines and their joint treatment is a highly ill-posed inverse problem where at-least two-thirds of the information are missing and the rest are corrupted by noise. This poses a great challenge in obtaining meaningful reconstructions and a special care for the efficient treatment of the problem is required. While there are several machine learning approaches that have been recently introduced to deal with joint image demosaicking-denoising, in this work we propose a novel deep learning architecture which is inspired by powerful classical image regularization methods and large-scale convex optimization techniques. Consequently, our derived network is more transparent and has a clear interpretation compared to alternative competitive deep learning approaches. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our network outperforms any previous approaches on both noisy and noise-free data. This improvement in reconstruction quality is attributed to the principled way we design our network architecture, which also requires fewer trainable parameters than the current state-of-the-art deep network solution. Finally, we show that our network has the ability to generalize well even when it is trained on small datasets, while keeping the overall number of trainable parameters low.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Filippos_Kokkinos_Deep_Image_Demosaicking_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Filippos Kokkinos, Stamatios Lefkimmiatis
Accurate Scene Text Detection through Border Semantics Awareness and Bootstrapping	This paper presents a scene text detection technique that exploits bootstrapping and text border semantics for accurate localization of texts in scenes. A novel bootstrapping technique is designed which samples multiple 'subsections' of a word or text line and accordingly relieves the constraint of limited training data effectively. At the same time, the repeated sampling of text 'subsections' improves the consistency of the predicted text feature maps which is critical in predicting a single complete instead of multiple broken boxes for long words or text lines. In addition, a semantics-aware text border detection technique is designed which produces four types of text border segments for each scene text. With semantics-aware text borders, scene texts can be localized more accurately by regressing text pixels around the ends of words or text lines instead of all text pixels which often leads to inaccurate localization while dealing with long words or text lines. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, and superior performance is obtained over several public datasets, e. g. 80.1 f-score for the MSRA-TD500, 67.1 f-score for the ICDAR2017-RCTW, etc.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chuhui_Xue_Accurate_Scene_Text_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chuhui Xue, Shijian Lu, Fangneng Zhan
Learn-to-Score: Efficient 3D Scene Exploration by Predicting View Utility	Camera equipped drones are nowadays being used to explore large scenes and reconstruct detailed 3D maps. When free space in the scene is approximately known, an offline planner can generate optimal plans to efficiently explore the scene. However, for exploring unknown scenes, the planner must predict and maximize usefulness of where to go on the fly. Traditionally, this has been achieved using handcrafted utility functions. We propose to learn a better utility function that predicts the usefulness of future viewpoints. Our learned utility function is based on a 3D convolutional neural network. This network takes as input a novel volumetric scene representation that implicitly captures previously visited viewpoints and generalizes to new scenes. We evaluate our method on several large 3D models of urban scenes using simulated depth cameras. We show that our method outperforms existing utility measures in terms of reconstruction performance and is robust to sensor noise.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Benjamin_Hepp_Learn-to-Score_Efficient_3D_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Benjamin Hepp, Debadeepta Dey, Sudipta N.

Open Set Domain Adaptation by Backpropagation	Numerous algorithms have been proposed for transferring knowledge from a label-rich domain (source) to a label-scarce domain (target). Most of them are proposed for closed-set scenario, where the source and the target domain completely share the class of their samples. However, in practice, a target domain can contain samples of classes that are not shared by the source domain. We call such classes the doublequote{unknown class} and algorithms that work well in the open set situation are very practical. However, most existing distribution matching methods for domain adaptation do not work well in this setting because unknown target samples should not be aligned with the source. In this paper, we propose a method for an open set domain adaptation scenario, which utilizes adversarial training. This approach allows to extract features that separate unknown target from known target samples. During training, we assign two options to the feature generator: aligning target samples with source known ones or rejecting them as unknown target ones. Our method was extensively evaluated and outperformed other methods with a large margin in most settings.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Kuniaki_Saito_Adversarial_Open_Set_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Kuniaki Saito, Shohei Yamamoto, Yoshitaka Ushiku, Tatsuya Harada
ContextVP: Fully Context-Aware Video Prediction	Video prediction models based on convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and their combinations often result in blurry predictions. We identify an important contributing factor for imprecise predictions that has not been studied adequately in the literature: blind spots, i.e., lack of access to all relevant past information for accurately predicting the future. To address this issue, we introduce a fully context-aware architecture that captures the entire available past context for each pixel using Parallel Multi-Dimensional LSTM units and aggregates it using blending units. Our model outperforms a strong baseline network of 20 recurrent convolutional layers and yields state-of-the-art performance for next step prediction on three challenging real-world video datasets: Human 3.6M, Caltech Pedestrian, and UCF-101. Moreover, it does so with fewer parameters than several recently proposed models, and does not rely on deep convolutional networks, multi-scale architectures, separation of background and foreground modeling, motion flow learning, or adversarial training. These results highlight that full awareness of past context is of crucial importance for video prediction.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Wonmin_Byeon_ContextVP_Fully_Context-Aware_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Wonmin Byeon, Qin Wang, Rupesh Kumar Srivastava, Petros Koumoutsakos
Zero-shot keyword spotting for visual speech recognition in-the-wild	Visual keyword spotting (KWS) is the problem of estimating whether a text query occurs in a given recording using only video information. This paper focuses on visual KWS for words unseen during training, a real-world, practical setting which so far has received no attention by the community. To this end, we devise an end-to-end architecture comprising (a) a state-of-the-art visual feature extractor based on spatiotemporal Residual Networks, (b) a grapheme-to-phoneme model based on sequence-to-sequence neural networks, and (c) a stack of recurrent neural networks which learn how to correlate visual features with the keyword representation. Different to prior works on KWS, which try to learn word representations merely from sequences of graphemes (i.e. letters), we propose the use of a grapheme-to-phoneme encoder-decoder model which learns how to map words to their pronunciation. We demonstrate that our system obtains very promising visual-only KWS results on the challenging LRS2 database, for keywords unseen during training. We also show that our system outperforms a baseline which addresses KWS via automatic speech recognition (ASR), while it drastically improves over other recently proposed ASR-free KWS methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Themos_Stafylakis_Zero-shot_keyword_search_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Themos Stafylakis, Georgios Tzimiropoulos
Joint Person Segmentation and Identification in Synchronized First- and Third-person Videos	In a world of pervasive cameras, public spaces are often captured from multiple perspectives by cameras of different types, both fixed and mobile. An important problem is to organize these heterogeneous collections of videos by finding connections between them, such as identifying correspondences between the people appearing in the videos and the people holding or wearing the cameras. In this paper, we wish to solve two specific problems: (1) given two or more synchronized third-person videos of a scene, produce a pixel-level segmentation of each visible person and identify corresponding people across different views (i.e., determine who in camera A corresponds with whom in camera B), and (2) given one or more synchronized third-person videos as well as a first-person video taken by a mobile or wearable camera, segment and identify the camera wearer in the third-person videos. Unlike previous work which requires ground truth bounding boxes to estimate the correspondences, we perform person segmentation and identification jointly. We find that solving these two problems simultaneously is mutually beneficial, because better fine-grained segmentation allows us to better perform matching across views, and information from multiple views helps us perform more accurate segmentation. We evaluate our approach on two challenging datasets of interacting people captured from multiple wearable cameras, and show that our proposed method performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art on both person segmentation and identification.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Mingze_Xu_Joint_Person_Segmentation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Mingze Xu, Chenyou Fan, Yuchen Wang, Michael S.

Variational Wasserstein Clustering	We propose a new clustering method based on optimal transportation. We discuss the connection between optimal transportation and k-means clustering, solve optimal transportation with the variational principle, and investigate the use of power diagrams as transportation plans for aggregating arbitrary domains into a fixed number of clusters. We drive cluster centroids through the target domain while maintaining the minimum clustering energy by adjusting the power diagram. Thus, we simultaneously pursue clustering and the Wasserstein distance between the centroids and the target domain, resulting in a measure-preserving mapping. We demonstrate the use of our method in domain adaptation, remeshing, and learning representations on synthetic and real data.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Liang_Mi_Variational_Wasserstein_Clustering_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Liang Mi, Wen Zhang, Xianfeng Gu, Yalin Wang
Coreset-Based Neural Network Compression	We propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) compression algorithm based on coreset representations of filters. We exploit the redundancies extant in the space of CNN weights and neuronal activations (across samples) in order to obtain compression. Our method requires no retraining, is easy to implement, and obtains state-of-the-art compression performance across a wide variety of CNN architectures. Coupled with quantization and Huffman coding, we create networks that provide AlexNet-like accuracy, with a memory footprint that is $832 imes$ smaller than the original AlexNet, while also introducing significant reductions in inference time as well. Additionally these compressed networks when fine-tuned, successfully generalize to other domains as well.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Abhimanyu_Dubey_Coreset-Based_Convolutional_Neural_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Abhimanyu Dubey, Moitreya Chatterjee, Narendra Ahuja
Learning 3D Shapes as Multi-Layered Height-maps using 2D Convolutional Networks	We present a novel global representation of 3D shapes, suitable for the application of 2D CNNs. We represent 3D shapes as multi-layered height maps (MLH) where at each grid location, we store multiple instances of height maps, thereby representing 3D shape detail that is hidden behind several layers of occlusion. We provide a novel view merging method for combining view dependent information (Eg. MLH descriptors) from multiple views. Because of the ability of using 2D CNNs our method is highly memory efficient in terms of input resolution compared to the voxel based input. Together with MLH descriptors, and our multi view merging we achieve the state-of-the-art result in classification on ModelNet dataset.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Kripasindhu_Sarkar_Learning_3D_shapes_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Kripasindhu Sarkar, Basavaraj Hampiholi, Kiran Varanasi, Didier Stricker
Into the Twilight Zone: Depth Estimation using Joint Structure-Stereo Optimization	We present a joint Structure-Stereo optimization model that is robust for disparity estimation under low-light conditions. Eschewing the traditional denoising approach - which we show to be ineffective for stereo due to its artefacts and the questionable use of the PSNR metric, we propose to instead rely on structures comprising of piecewise constant regions and principal edges in the given image, as these are the important regions for extracting disparity information. We also judiciously retain the coarser textures for stereo matching, discarding the finer textures as they are apt to be inextricably mixed with noise. This selection process in the structure-texture decomposition step is aided by the stereo matching constraint in our joint Structure-Stereo formulation. The resulting optimization problem is complex but we are able to decompose it into sub-problems that admit relatively standard solutions. Our experiments confirm that our joint model significantly outperforms the baseline methods on both synthetic and real noise datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Aashish_Sharma_Into_the_Twilight_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Aashish Sharma, Loong-Fah Cheong
Teaching Machines to Understand Baseball Games: Large-Scale Baseball Video Database for Multiple Video Understanding Tasks	A major obstacle in teaching machines to understand videos is the lack of training data, as creating temporal annotations for long videos requires a huge amount of human effort. To this end, we introduce a new large-scale baseball video dataset called the BBDB, which is produced semi-automatically by using play-by-play texts available online. The BBDB contains 4200 hours of baseball game videos with 400k temporally annotated activity segments. The new dataset has several major challenging factors compared to other datasets: 1) the dataset contains a large number of visually similar segments with different labels. 2) It can be used for many video understanding tasks including video recognition, localization, text-video alignment, video highlight generation, and data imbalance problem. To observe the potential of the BBDB, we conducted extensive experiments by running many different types of video understanding algorithms on our new dataset.

Coloring with Words: Guiding Image Colorization Through Text-based Palette Generation	This paper proposes a novel approach to generate multiple color palettes that reflect the semantics of input text and then colorize a given grayscale image according to the generated color palette. In contrast to existing approaches, our model can understand rich text, whether it is a single word, a phrase, or a sentence, and generate multiple possible palettes from it. For this task, we introduce our manually curated dataset called Palette-and-Text (PAT). Our proposed model called Text2Colors consists of two conditional generative adversarial networks: the text-to-palette generation networks and the palette-based colorization networks. The former captures the semantics of the text input and produce relevant color palettes. The latter colorizes a grayscale image using the generated color palette. Our evaluation results show that people preferred our generated palettes over ground truth palettes and that our model can effectively reflect the given palette when colorizing an image.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hyojin_Bahng_Coloring_with_Words_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hyojin Bahng, Seungjoo Yoo, Wonwoong Cho, David Keetae Park, Ziming Wu, Xiaojuan Ma, Jaegul Choo
ELEGANT: Exchanging Latent Encodings with GAN for Transferring Multiple Face Attributes	Recent studies on face attribute transfer have achieved great success. A lot of models are able to transfer face attributes with an input image. However, they suffer from three limitations: (1) incapability of generating image by exemplars; (2) being unable to transfer multiple face attributes simultaneously; (3) low quality of generated images, such as low-resolution or artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model which receives two images of opposite attributes as inputs. Our model can transfer exactly the same type of attributes from one image to another by exchanging certain part of their encodings. All the attributes are encoded in a disentangled manner in the latent space, which enables us to manipulate several attributes simultaneously. Besides, our model learns the residual images so as to facilitate training on higher resolution images. With the help of multi-scale discriminators for adversarial training, it can even generate high-quality images with finer details and less artifacts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on overcoming the above three limitations by comparing with other methods on the CelebA face database. A pytorch implementation is available at https://github.com/Prinsphield/ELEGANT.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Taihong_Xiao_ELEGANT_Exchanging_Latent_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Taihong Xiao, Jiapeng Hong, Jinwen Ma
Visual Text Correction	Videos, images, and sentences are mediums that can express the same semantics. One can imagine a picture by reading a sentence or can describe a scene with some words. However, even small changes in a sentence can cause a significant semantic inconsistency with the corresponding video/image. For example, by changing the verb of a sentence, the meaning may drastically change. There have been many efforts to encode a video/sentence and decode it as a sentence/video. In this research, we study a new scenario in which both the sentence and the video are given, but the sentence is inaccurate. A semantic inconsistency between the sentence and the video or between the words of a sentence can result in an inaccurate description. This paper introduces a new problem, called Visual Text Correction (VTC), i.e., finding and replacing an inaccurate word in the textual description of a video. We propose a deep network that can simultaneously detect an inaccuracy in a sentence, and fix it by replacing the inaccurate word(s). Our method leverages the semantic interdependence of videos and words, as well as the short-term and long-term relations of the words in a sentence. In our formulation, part of a visual feature vector for every single word is dynamically selected through a gating process. Furthermore, to train and evaluate our model, we propose an approach to automatically construct a large dataset for VTC problem. Our experiments and performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed method provides very good results and also highlights the general challenges in solving the VTC problem. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first of its kind for the Visual Text Correction task.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Amir_Mazaheri_Visual_Text_Correction_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Amir Mazaheri, Mubarak Shah
Unsupervised holistic image generation from key local patches	We introduce a new problem of generating an image based on a small number of key local patches without any geometric prior. In this work, key local patches are defined as informative regions of the target object or scene. This is a challenging problem since it requires generating realistic images and predicting locations of parts at the same time. We construct adversarial networks to tackle this problem. A generator network generates a fake image as well as a mask based on the encoder-decoder framework. On the other hand, a discriminator network aims to detect fake images. The network is trained with three losses to consider spatial, appearance, and adversarial information. The spatial loss determines whether the locations of predicted parts are correct. Input patches are restored in the output image without much modification due to the appearance loss. The adversarial loss ensures output images are realistic. The proposed network is trained without supervisory signals since no labels of key parts are required. Experimental results on six datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably on challenging objects and scenes.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Donghoon_Lee_Unsupervised_holistic_image_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Donghoon Lee, Sangdoo Yun, Sungjoon Choi, Hwiyeon Yoo, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Songhwai Oh
Faces as Lighting Probes via Unsupervised Deep Highlight Extraction	We present a method for estimating detailed scene illumination using human faces in a single image. In contrast to previous works that estimate lighting in terms of low-order basis functions or distant point lights, our technique estimates illumination at a higher precision in the form of a non-parametric environment map. Based on the observation that faces can exhibit strong highlight reflections from a broad range of lighting directions, we propose a deep neural network for extracting highlights from faces, and then trace these reflections back to the scene to acquire the environment map. Since real training data for highlight extraction is very limited, we introduce an unsupervised scheme for finetuning the network on real images, based on the consistent diffuse chromaticity of a given face seen in multiple real images. In tracing the estimated highlights to the environment, we reduce the blurring effect of skin reflectance on reflected light through a deconvolution determined by prior knowledge on face material properties. Comparisons to previous techniques for highlight extraction and illumination estimation show the state-of-the-art performance of this approach on a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Renjiao_Yi_Faces_as_Lighting_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Renjiao Yi, Chenyang Zhu, Ping Tan, Stephen Lin
Videos as Space-Time Region Graphs	"How do humans recognize the action ""opening a book""? We argue that there are two important cues: modeling temporal shape dynamics and modeling functional relationships between humans and objects. In this paper, we propose to represent videos as space-time region graphs which capture these two important cues. Our graph nodes are defined by the object region proposals from different frames in a long range video. These nodes are connected by two types of relations: (i) similarity relations capturing the long range dependencies between correlated objects and (ii) spatial-temporal relations capturing the interactions between nearby objects. We perform reasoning on this graph representation via Graph Convolutional Networks. We achieve state-of-the-art results on the Charades and Something-Something datasets. Especially for Charades with complex environments, we obtain a huge 4.4% gain when our model is applied in complex environments."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiaolong_Wang_Videos_as_Space-Time_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiaolong Wang, Abhinav Gupta
Volumetric performance capture from minimal camera viewpoints	We present a convolutional autoencoder that enables high fidelity volumetric reconstructions of human performance to be captured from multi-view video comprising only a small set of camera views. Our method yields similar end-to-end reconstruction error to that of a probabilistic visual hull computed using significantly more (double or more) viewpoints. We use a deep prior implicitly learned by the autoencoder trained over a dataset of view-ablated multi-view video footage of a wide range of subjects and actions. This opens up the possibility of high-end volumetric performance capture in on-set and prosumer scenarios where time or cost prohibit a high witness camera count.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Andrew_Gilbert_Volumetric_performance_capture_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Andrew Gilbert, Marco Volino, John Collomosse, Adrian Hilton
VSO: Visual Semantic Odometry	Robust data association is a core problem of visual odometry, where image-to-image correspondences provide constraints for camera pose and map estimation. Current state-of-the-art direct and indirect methods use short-term tracking to obtain continuous frame-to-frame constraints, while long-term constraints are established using loop closures. In this paper, we propose a novel visual semantic odometry (VSO) framework to enable medium-term continuous tracking of points using semantics. Our proposed framework can be easily integrated into existing direct and indirect visual odometry pipelines. Experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate a significant improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in the context of autonomous driving simply by integrating our semantic constraints.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Konstantinos-Nektarios_Lianos_VSO_Visual_Semantic_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Konstantinos-Nektarios Lianos, Johannes L.

Person Re-identification with Deep Similarity-Guided Graph Neural Network	The person re-identification task requires to robustly estimate visual similarities between person images. However, existing person re-identification models mostly estimate the similarities of different image pairs of probe and gallery images independently while ignores the relationship information between different probe-gallery pairs. As a result, the similarity estimation of some hard samples might not be accurate. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, named Similarity-Guided Graph Neural Network (SGGNN) to overcome such limitations. Given a probe image and several gallery images, SGGNN creates a graph to represent the pairwise relationships between probe-gallery pairs (nodes) and utilizes such relationships to update the probe-gallery relation features in an end-to-end manner. Accurate similarity estimation can be achieved by using such updated probe-gallery relation features for prediction. The input features for nodes on the graph are the relation features of different probe-gallery image pairs. The probe-gallery relation feature updating is then performed by the messages passing in SGGNN, which takes other nodes' information into account for similarity estimation. Different from conventional GNN approaches, SGGNN learns the edge weights with rich labels of gallery instance pairs directly, which provides relation fusion more precise information. The effectiveness of our proposed method is validated on three public person re-identification datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yantao_Shen_Person_Re-identification_with_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yantao Shen, Hongsheng Li, Shuai Yi, Dapeng Chen, Xiaogang Wang
Triplet Loss in Siamese Network for Object Tracking	Object tracking is still a critical and challenging problem with many applications in computer vision. For this challenge, more and more researchers pay attention to applying deep learning to get powerful feature for better tracking accuracy. In this paper, a novel triplet loss is proposed to extract expressive deep feature for object tracking by adding it into Siamese network framework instead of pairwise loss for training. Without adding any inputs, our approach is able to utilize more elements for training to achieve more powerful feature via the combination of original samples. Furthermore, we propose a theoretical analysis by combining comparison of gradients and back-propagation, to prove the effectiveness of our method. In experiments, we apply the proposed triplet loss for three real-time trackers based on Siamese network. And the results on several popular tracking benchmarks show our variants operate at almost the same frame-rate with baseline trackers and achieve superior tracking performance than them, as well as the comparable accuracy with recent state-of-the-art real-time trackers.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xingping_Dong_Triplet_Loss_with_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xingping Dong, Jianbing Shen
ShapeCodes: Self-Supervised Feature Learning by Lifting Views to Viewgrids	"We introduce an unsupervised feature learning approach that embeds 3D shape information into a single-view image representation. The main idea is a self-supervised training objective that, given only a single 2D image, requires all unseen views of the object to be predictable from learned features. We implement this idea as an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network. The network maps an input image of an unknown category and unknown viewpoint to a latent space, from which a deconvolutional decoder can best ""lift"" the image to its complete viewgrid showing the object from all viewing angles. Our class-agnostic training procedure encourages the representation to capture fundamental shape primitives and semantic regularities in a data-driven manner—without manual semantic labels. Our results on two widely-used shape datasets show 1) our approach successfully learns to perform ""mental rotation"" even for objects unseen during training, and 2) the learned latent space is a powerful representation for object recognition, outperforming several existing unsupervised feature learning methods."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Dinesh_Jayaraman_ShapeCodes_Self-Supervised_Feature_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Dinesh Jayaraman, Ruohan Gao, Kristen Grauman
Deforming Autoencoders: Unsupervised Disentangling of Shape and Appearance	In this work we introduce the Deforming Autoencoder, a generative model for images that disentangles shape from appearance in a latent representation space that is learned in a fully unsupervised manner. As in the deformable template paradigm, shape is represented as a diffeomorphism between a canonical coordinate system (`template') and an observed image, while appearance is modeled in template coordinates, thus discarding variability due to deformations. We introduce novel techniques that allow this approach to be deployed in the setting of autoencoders and show that this method can be used for unsupervised group-wise image alignment. We show experiments with expression morphing in humans, hands, and digits, face manipulation, such as shape and appearance interpolation, as well as unsupervised landmark localization. A more powerful form of unsupervised disentangling becomes possible in template coordinates, allowing us to successfully decompose face images into shading and albedo, and further manipulate face images.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhixin_Shu_Deforming_Autoencoders_Unsupervised_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhixin Shu, Mihir Sahasrabudhe, Riza Alp Guler, Dimitris Samaras, Nikos Paragios, Iasonas Kokkinos
A Modulation Module for Multi-task Learning with Applications in Image Retrieval	Multi-task learning has been widely adopted in many computer vision tasks to improve overall computation efficiency or boost the performance of individual tasks, under the assumption that those tasks are correlated and complementary to each other. However, the relationships between the tasks are complicated in practice, especially when the number of involved tasks scales up. When two tasks are of weak relevance, they may compete or even distract each other during joint training shared parameters, and as a consequence undermine the learning of all the tasks. This will raise destructive interference which decreases learning efficiency of shared parameters and lead to low quality local optimum of shared parameters. To address the this problem, we propose a general modulation module, which can be inserted into any convolutional neural network architecture, to encourage the coupling and feature sharing of relevant tasks while disentangling the learning of irrelevant tasks with minor parameters addition. Equipped with this module, gradient directions from different tasks can be enforced to be consistent for those shared parameters, which benefits multi-task joint training. The module is end-to-end learnable without ad-hoc design for specific tasks, and can naturally handle many tasks at the same time. We apply our approach on two retrieval tasks, face retrieval on the CelebA dataset and product retrieval on the UT-Zappos50K dataset, and demonstrate its advantage over other multi-task learning methods in both accuracy and storage efficiency.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiangyun_Zhao_A_Modulation_Module_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiangyun Zhao, Haoxiang Li, Xiaohui Shen, Xiaodan Liang, Ying Wu
Stroke Controllable Fast Style Transfer with Adaptive Receptive Fields	The Fast Style Transfer methods have been recently proposed to transfer a photograph to an artistic style in real-time. This task involves controlling the stroke size in the stylized results, which remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present a stroke controllable style transfer network that can achieve continuous and spatial stroke size control. By analyzing the factors that influence the stroke size, we propose to explicitly account for the receptive field and the style image scales. We propose a StrokePyramid module to endow the network with adaptive receptive fields, and two training strategies to achieve faster convergence and augment new stroke sizes upon a trained model respectively. By combining the proposed runtime control strategies, our network can achieve continuous changes in stroke sizes and produce distinct stroke sizes in different spatial regions within the same output image.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yongcheng_Jing_Stroke_Controllable_Fast_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yongcheng Jing, Yang Liu, Yezhou Yang, Zunlei Feng, Yizhou Yu, Dacheng Tao, Mingli Song
Efficient Global Point Cloud Registration by Matching Rotation Invariant Features Through Translation Search	Three-dimensional rigid point cloud registration has many applications in computer vision and robotics. Local methods tend to fail, causing global methods to be needed, when the relative transformation is large or the overlap ratio is small. Most existing global methods utilize BnB optimization over the 6D parameter space of SE(3). Such methods are usually very slow because the time complexity of BnB optimization is exponential in the dimensionality of the parameter space. In this paper, we decouple the optimization of translation and rotation, and we propose a fast BnB algorithm to globally optimize the 3D translation parameter first. The optimal rotation is then calculated by utilizing the global optimal translation found by the BnB algorithm. The separate optimization of translation and rotation is realized by using a newly proposed rotation invariant feature. Experiments on challenging data sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art global methods in terms of both speed and accuracy.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yinlong_Liu_Efficient_Global_Point_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yinlong Liu, Chen Wang, Zhijian Song, Manning Wang
Multi-scale Residual Network for Image Super-Resolution	Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks can significantly improve the quality of single-image super-resolution. Current researches tend to use deeper convolutional neural networks to enhance performance. However, blindly increasing the depth of the network cannot ameliorate the network effectively. Worse still, with the depth of the network increases, more problems occurred in the training process and more training tricks are needed. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale residual network (MSRN) to fully exploit the image features, which outperform most of the state-of-the-art methods. Based on the residual block, we introduce convolution kernels of different sizes to adaptively detect the image features in different scales. Meanwhile, we let these features interact with each other to get the most efficacious image information, we call this structure Multi-scale Residual Block (MSRB). Furthermore, the outputs of each MSRB are used as the hierarchical features for global feature fusion. Finally, all these features are sent to the reconstruction module for recovering the high-quality image.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Juncheng_Li_Multi-scale_Residual_Network_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Juncheng Li, Faming Fang, Kangfu Mei, Guixu Zhang
Accelerating Dynamic Programs via Nested Benders Decomposition with Application to Multi-Person Pose Estimation	We present a novel approach to solve dynamic programs (DP), which are frequent in computer vision, on tree-structured graphs with exponential node state space. Typical DP approaches have to enumerate the joint state space of two adjacent nodes on every edge of the tree to compute the optimal messages. Here we propose an algorithm based on Nested Benders Decomposition (NBD) which iteratively lower-bounds the message on every edge and promises to be far more efficient. We apply our NBD algorithm along with a novel Minimum Weight Set Packing (MWSP) formulation to a multi-person pose estimation problem. While our algorithm is provably optimal at termination it operates in linear time for practical DP problems, gaining up to 500x speed up over traditional DP algorithm which have polynomial complexity.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Shaofei_Wang_Accelerating_Dynamic_Programs_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Shaofei Wang, Alexander Ihler, Konrad Kording, Julian Yarkony
3D Scene Flow from 4D Light Field Gradients	"This paper presents novel techniques for recovering 3D dense scene flow, based on differential analysis of 4D light fields. The key enabling result is a per-ray linear equation, called the ray flow equation, that relates 3D scene flow to 4D light field gradients. The ray flow equation is invariant to 3D scene structure and applicable to a general class of scenes, but is underconstrained (3 unknowns per equation). Thus, additional constraints must be imposed to recover motion. We develop two families of scene flow algorithms by leveraging the structural similarity between ray flow and optical flow equations: local ""Lucas-Kanade"" ray flow and global ""Horn-Schunck"" ray flow, inspired by corresponding optical flow methods. We also develop a combined local-global method by utilizing the correspondence structure in the light fields. We demonstrate high precision 3D scene flow recovery for a wide range of scenarios, including rotation and non-rigid motion. We analyze the theoretical and practical performance limits of the proposed techniques via the light field structure tensor, a 3x3 matrix that encodes the local structure of light fields. We envision that the proposed analysis and algorithms will lead to design of future light-field cameras that are optimized for motion sensing, in addition to depth sensing."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Sizhuo_3D_Motion_Sensing_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Sizhuo Ma, Brandon M.

Sequential Clique Optimization for Video Object Segmentation	A novel algorithm to segment out objects in a video sequence is proposed in this work. First, we extract object instances in each frame. Then, we select a visually important object instance in each frame to construct the salient object track through the sequence. This can be formulated as finding the maximal weight clique in a complete k-partite graph, which is NP hard. Therefore, we develop the sequential clique optimization (SCO) technique to efficiently determine the cliques corresponding to salient object tracks. We convert these tracks into video object segmentation results. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art video object segmentation and video salient object detection algorithms on recent benchmark datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yeong_Jun_Koh_Sequential_Clique_Optimization_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yeong Jun Koh, Young-Yoon Lee, Chang-Su Kim
Leveraging Motion Priors in Videos for Improving Human Segmentation	"Despite many advances in deep-learning based semantic segmentation, performance drop due to distribution mismatch is often encountered in the real world. Recently, a few domain adaptation and active learning approaches have been proposed to mitigate the performance drop. However, very little attention has been made toward leveraging information in videos which are naturally captured in most camera systems. In this work, we propose to leverage ""motion prior"" in videos for improving human segmentation in a weakly-supervised active learning setting. By extracting motion information using optical flow in videos, we can extract candidate foreground motion segments (referred to as motion prior) potentially corresponding to human segments. We propose to learn a memory-network-based policy model to select strong candidate segments (referred to as strong motion prior) through reinforcement learning. The selected segments have high precision and are directly used to finetune the model. In a newly collected surveillance camera dataset and a publicly available UrbanStreet dataset, our proposed method improves the performance of human segmentation across multiple scenes and modalities (i.e., RGB to Infrared (IR)). Last but not least, our method is empirically complementary to existing domain adaptation approaches such that additional performance gain is achieved by combining our weakly-supervised active learning approach with domain adaptation approaches."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yu-Ting_Chen_Leveraging_Motion_Priors_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yu-Ting Chen, Wen-Yen Chang, Hai-Lun Lu, Tingfan Wu, Min Sun
Temporal Relational Reasoning in Videos	Temporal relational reasoning, the ability to link meaningful transformations of objects or entities over time, is a fundamental property of intelligent species. In this paper, we introduce an effective and interpretable network module, the Temporal Relation Network (TRN), designed to learn and reason about temporal dependencies between video frames at multiple time scales. We evaluate TRN-equipped networks on activity recognition tasks using three recent video datasets - Something-Something, Jester, and Charades - which fundamentally depend on temporal relational reasoning. Our results demonstrate that the proposed TRN gives convolutional neural networks a remarkable capacity to discover temporal relations in videos. Through only sparsely sampled video frames, TRN-equipped networks can accurately predict human-object interactions in the Something-Something dataset and identify various human gestures on the Jester dataset with very competitive performance. TRN-equipped networks also outperform two-stream networks and 3D convolution networks in recognizing daily activities in the Charades dataset. Further analyses show that the models learn intuitive and interpretable visual common sense knowledge in videos.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Bolei_Zhou_Temporal_Relational_Reasoning_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Bolei Zhou, Alex Andonian, Aude Oliva, Antonio Torralba
Geolocation Estimation of Photos using a Hierarchical Model and Scene Classification	While the successful estimation of a photo's geolocation enables a number of interesting applications, it is also a very challenging task. Due to the complexity of the problem, most existing approaches are restricted to specific areas, imagery, or worldwide landmarks. Only a few proposals predict GPS coordinates without any limitations. In this paper, we introduce several deep learning methods, which pursue the latter approach and treat geolocalization as a classification problem where the earth is subdivided into geographical cells. We propose to exploit hierarchical knowledge of multiple partitionings and additionally extract and take the photo's scene content into account, i.e., indoor, natural, or urban setting etc. As a result, contextual information at different spatial resolutions as well as more specific features for various environmental settings are incorporated in the learning process of the convolutional neural network. Experimental results on two benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach outperforming the state of the art while using a significant lower number of training images and without relying on retrieval methods that require an appropriate reference dataset.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Eric_Muller-Budack_Geolocation_Estimation_of_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Eric Muller-Budack, Kader Pustu-Iren, Ralph Ewerth
Domain transfer through deep activation matching	We introduce a layer-wise unsupervised domain adaptation approach for the task of semantic segmentation. Instead of merely matching the output distributions of the source and target domains, our approach aligns the distributions of activations of intermediate layers. This scheme exhibits two key advantages. First, matching across intermediate layers introduces more constraints for training the network in the target domain, making the optimization problem better conditioned. Second, the matched activations at each layer provide similar inputs to the next layer for both training and adaptation, and thus alleviate covariate shift. We use a Generative Adversarial Network (or GAN) to align activation distributions. Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of popular domain adaptation tasks, including (1) from GTA to Cityscapes for semantic segmentation, (2) from SYNTHIA to Cityscapes for semantic segmentation, and (3) adaptations on USPS and MNIST for image classification.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Haoshuo_Huang_Domain_transfer_through_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Haoshuo Huang, Qixing Huang, Philipp Krahenbuhl
Lip Movements Generation at a Glance	Cross-modality generation is an emerging topic that aims to synthesize data in one modality based on information in a different modality. In this paper, we consider a task of such: given an arbitrary audio speech and one lip image of arbitrary target identity, generate synthesized lip movements of the target identity saying the speech. To perform well in this task, it inevitably requires a model to not only consider the retention of target identity, photo-realistic of synthesized images, consistency and smoothness of lip images in a sequence, but more importantly, learn the correlations between audio speech and lip movements. To solve the collective problems, we explore the best modeling of the audio-visual correlations in building and training a lip-movement generator network. Specifically, we devise a method to fuse audio and image embeddings to generate multiple lip images at once and propose a novel correlation loss to synchronize lip changes and speech changes. Our final model utilizes a combination of four losses for a comprehensive consideration in generating lip movements; it is trained in an end-to-end fashion and is robust to lip shapes, view angles and different facial characteristics. Thoughtful experiments on three datasets ranging from lab-recorded to lips in the wild show that our model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods extended to this task.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Lele_Chen_Lip_Movements_Generation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Lele Chen, Zhiheng Li, Ross K Maddox, Zhiyao Duan, Chenliang Xu
A+D Net: Training a Shadow Detector with Adversarial Shadow Attenuation	We propose a novel GAN-based framework for detecting shadows in images, in which a shadow detection network (D-Net) is trained together with a shadow attenuation network (A-Net) that generates adversarial training examples. The A-Net modifies the original training images constrained by a simplified physical shadow model and is focused on fooling the D-Net's shadow predictions. Hence, it is effectively augmenting the training data for D-Net with hard-to-predict cases. The D-Net is trained to predict shadows in both original images and generated images from the A-Net. Our experimental results show that the additional training data from A-Net significantly improves the shadow detection accuracy of D-Net. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the most challenging shadow detection benchmark (SBU) and also obtains state-of-the-art results on a cross-dataset task, testing on UCF. Furthermore, the proposed method achieves accurate real-time shadow detection at 45 frames per second.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hieu_Le_AD_Net_Training_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hieu Le, Tomas F.

Exploiting Vector Fields for Geometric Rectification of Distorted Document Images	This paper proposes a segment-free method for geometric rectification of a distorted document image captured by a hand-held camera. The method can recover the 3D page shape by exploiting the intrinsic vector fields of the image. Based on the assumption that the curled page shape is a general cylindrical surface, we estimate the parameters related to the camera and the 3D shape model through weighted majority voting on the vector fields. Then the spatial directrix of the surface is recovered by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) through the Euler method. Finally, the geometric distortions in images can be rectified by flattening the estimated 3D page surface onto a plane. Our method can exploit diverse types of visual cues available in a distorted document image to estimate its vector fields for 3D page shape recovery. In comparison to the state-of-the-art methods, the great advantage is that it is a segment-free method and does not have to extract curved text lines or textual blocks, which is still a very challenging problem especially for a distorted document image. Our method can therefore be freely applied to document images with extremely complicated page layouts and severe image quality degradation. Extensive experiments are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Gaofeng_Meng_Exploiting_Vector_Fields_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Gaofeng MENG, Yuanqi SU, Ying WU, Shiming XIANG, Chunhong PAN
Facial Expression Recognition with Inconsistently Annotated Datasets	Annotation errors and bias are inevitable among different facial expression datasets due to the subjectiveness of annotating facial expressions. Ascribe to the inconsistent annotations, performance of existing facial expression recognition (FER) methods cannot keep improving when the training set is enlarged by merging multiple datasets. To address the inconsistency, we propose an Inconsistent Pseudo Annotations to Latent Truth(IPA2LT) framework to train a FER model from multiple inconsistently labeled datasets and large scale unlabeled data. In IPA2LT, we assign each sample more than one labels with human annotations or model predictions. Then, we propose an end-to-end LTNet with a scheme of discovering the latent truth from the inconsistent pseudo labels and the input face images. To our knowledge, IPA2LT serves as the first work to solve the training problem with inconsistently labeled FER datasets. Experiments on synthetic data validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in learning from inconsistent labels. We also conduct extensive experiments in FER and show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art and optional methods under a rigorous evaluation protocol involving 7 FER datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jiabei_Zeng_Facial_Expression_Recognition_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jiabei Zeng, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen
Layer-structured 3D Scene Inference via View Synthesis	We present an approach to infer a layer-structured 3D representation of a scene from a single input image. This allows us to infer not only the depth of the visible pixels, but also to capture the texture and depth for content in the scene that is not directly visible. We overcome the challenge posed by the lack of direct supervision by instead leveraging a more naturally available multi-view supervisory signal. Our insight is to use view synthesis as a proxy task: we enforce that our representation (inferred from a single image), when rendered from a novel perspective, matches the true observed image. We present a learning framework that operationalizes this insight using a new, differentiable novel view renderer. We provide qualitative and quantitative validation of our approach in two different settings, and demonstrate that we can learn to capture the hidden aspects of a scene.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Shubham_Tulsiani_Layer-structured_3D_Scene_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Shubham Tulsiani, Richard Tucker, Noah Snavely
Video Object Segmentation with Joint Re-identification and Attention-Aware Mask Propagation	The problem of video object segmentation can become extremely challenging when multiple instances co-exist. While each instance may exhibit large scale and pose variations, the problem is compounded when instances occlude each other causing failures in tracking. In this study, we formulate a deep recurrent network that is capable of segmenting and tracking objects in video simultaneously by their temporal continuity, yet able to re-identify them when they re-appear after a prolonged occlusion. We combine both temporal propagation and re-identification functionalities into a single framework that can be trained end-to-end. In particular, we present a re-identification module with template expansion to retrieve missing objects despite their large appearance changes. In addition, we contribute a new attention-based recurrent mask propagation approach that is robust to distractors not belonging to the target segment. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art global mean (Region Jaccard and Boundary F measure) of 68.2 on the challenging DAVIS 2017 benchmark (test-dev set), outperforming the winning solution which achieves a global mean of 66.1 on the same partition.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiaoxiao_Li_Video_Object_Segmentation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiaoxiao Li, Chen Change Loy
CrossNet: An End-to-end Reference-based Super Resolution Network using Cross-scale Warping	The Reference-based Super-resolution (RefSR) super-resolves a low-resolution (LR) image given an external high-resolution (HR) reference image, where the reference image and LR image share similar viewpoint but with significant resolution gap x8. Existing RefSR methods work in a cascaded way such as patch matching followed by synthesis pipeline with two independently defined objective functions, leading to the inter-patch misalignment, grid effect and inefficient optimization. To resolve these issues, we present CrossNet, an end-to-end and fully-convolutional deep neural network using cross-scale warping. Our network contains image encoders, cross-scale warping layers, and fusion decoder: the encoder serves to extract multi-scale features from both the LR and the reference images; the cross-scale warping layers spatially aligns the reference feature map with the LR feature map; the decoder finally aggregates feature maps from both domains to synthesize the HR output. Using cross-scale warping, our network is able to perform spatial alignment at pixel-level in an end-to-end fashion, which improves the existing schemes both in precision (around 2dB-4dB) and efficiency (more than 100 times faster).	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Haitian_Zheng_CrossNet_An_End-to-end_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Haitian Zheng, Mengqi Ji, Haoqian Wang, Yebin Liu, Lu Fang
NAM: Non-Adversarial Unsupervised Domain Mapping	Several methods were recently proposed for the task of translating images between domains without prior knowledge in the form of correspondences. The existing methods apply adversarial learning to ensure that the distribution of the mapped source domain is indistinguishable from the target domain, which suffers from known stability issues. In addition, most methods rely heavily on ``cycle'' relationships between the domains, which enforce a one-to-one mapping. In this work, we introduce an alternative method: Non-Adversarial Mapping (NAM), which separates the task of target domain generative modeling from the cross-domain mapping task. NAM relies on a pre-trained generative model of the target domain, and aligns each source image with an image synthesized from the target domain, while jointly optimizing the domain mapping function. It has several key advantages: higher quality and resolution image translations, simpler and more stable training and reusable target models. Extensive experiments are presented validating the advantages of our method.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yedid_Hoshen_Separable_Cross-Domain_Translation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yedid Hoshen, Lior Wolf
Linear RGB-D SLAM for Planar Environments	We propose a new formulation for including orthogonal planar features as a global model into a linear SLAM approach based on sequential Bayesian filtering. Previous planar SLAM algorithms estimate the camera poses and multiple landmark planes in a pose graph optimization. However, since it is formulated as a high dimensional nonlinear optimization problem, there is no guarantee the algorithm will converge to the global optimum. To overcome these limitations, we present a new SLAM method that jointly estimates camera position and planar landmarks in the map within a linear Kalman filter framework. It is rotations that make the SLAM problem highly nonlinear. Therefore, we solve for the rotational motion of the camera using structural regularities in the Manhattan world (MW), resulting in a linear SLAM formulation. We test our algorithm on standard RGB-D benchmarks as well as additional large indoor environments, demonstrating comparable performance to other state-of-the-art SLAM methods without the use of expensive nonlinear optimization.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Pyojin_Kim_Linear_RGB-D_SLAM_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Pyojin Kim, Brian Coltin, H.

Occlusion-aware R-CNN: Detecting Pedestrians in a Crowd	Pedestrian detection in crowded scenes is a challenging problem since the pedestrians often gather together and occlude each other. In this paper, we propose a new occlusion-aware R-CNN (OR-CNN) to improve the detection accuracy in the crowd. Specifically, we design a new aggregation loss to enforce proposals to be close and locate compactly to the corresponding objects. Meanwhile, we use a new part occlusion-aware region of interest (PORoI) pooling unit to replace the RoI pooling layer in order to integrate the prior structure information of human body with visibility prediction into the network to handle occlusion. Our detector is trained in an end-to-end fashion, which achieves state-of-the-art results on three pedestrian detection datasets, i.e., CityPersons, ETH, and INRIA, and performs on-pair with the state-of-the-arts on Caltech.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Shifeng_Zhang_Occlusion-aware_R-CNN_Detecting_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Shifeng Zhang, Longyin Wen, Xiao Bian, Zhen Lei, Stan Z.

Learning Human-Object Interactions by Graph Parsing Neural Networks	This paper addresses the task of detecting and recognizing human-object interactions (HOI) in images and videos. We introduce the Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN), a framework that incorporates structural knowledge while being differentiable end-to-end. For a given scene, GPNN infers a parse graph that includes i) the HOI graph structure represented by an adjacency matrix, and ii) the node labels. Within a message passing inference framework, GPNN iteratively computes the adjacency matrices and node labels. We extensively evaluate our model on three HOI detection benchmarks on images and videos: HICO-DET, V-COCO, and CAD-120 datasets. Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-art methods, verifying that GPNN is scalable to large datasets and applies to spatial-temporal settings.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Siyuan_Qi_Learning_Human-Object_Interactions_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Siyuan Qi, Wenguan Wang, Baoxiong Jia, Jianbing Shen, Song-Chun Zhu
Real-Time Hair Rendering using Sequential Adversarial Networks	We present an adversarial network for rendering photorealistic hair as an alternative to conventional computer graphics pipelines. Our deep learning approach does not require low-level parameter tuning nor ad-hoc asset design. Our method simply takes a strand-based 3D hair model as input and provides intuitive user-control for color and lighting through reference images. To handle the diversity of hairstyles and its appearance complexity, we disentangle hair structure, color, and illumination properties using a sequential GAN architecture and a semi-supervised training approach. We also introduce an intermediate edge activation map to orientation field conversion step to ensure a successful CG-to-photoreal transition, while preserving the hair structures of the original input data. As we only require a feed-forward pass through the network, our rendering performs in real-time. We demonstrate the synthesis of photorealistic hair images on a wide range of intricate hairstyles and compare our technique with state-of-the-art hair rendering methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Lingyu_Wei_Real-Time_Hair_Rendering_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Lingyu Wei, Liwen Hu, Vladimir Kim, Ersin Yumer, Hao Li
Learning to Segment via Cut-and-Paste	This paper presents a weakly-supervised approach to object instance segmentation. Starting with known or predicted object bounding boxes, we learn object masks by playing a game of cut-and-paste in an adversarial learning setup. A mask generator takes a detection box and Faster R-CNN features, and constructs a segmentation mask that is used to cut-and-paste the object into a new image location. The discriminator tries to distinguish between real objects, and those cut and pasted via the generator, giving a learning signal that leads to improved object masks. We verify our method experimentally using Cityscapes, COCO, and aerial image datasets, learning to segment objects without ever having seen a mask in training. Our method exceeds the performance of existing weakly supervised methods, without requiring hand-tuned segment proposals, and reaches 90% of supervised performance.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tal_Remez_Learning_to_Segment_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tal Remez, Jonathan Huang, Matthew Brown
NNEval: Neural Network based Evaluation Metric for Image Captioning	The automatic evaluation of image descriptions is an intricate task, and it is highly important in the development and fine-grained analysis of captioning systems. Existing metrics to automatically evaluate image captioning systems fail to achieve a satisfactory level of correlation with human judgements at the sentence-level. Moreover, these metrics, unlike humans, tend to focus on specific aspects of quality, such as the n-gram overlap or the semantic meaning. In this paper, we present the first learning-based metric to evaluate image captions. Our proposed framework enables us to incorporate both lexical and semantic information into a single learned metric. This results in an evaluator that takes into account various linguistic features to assess the caption quality. The experiments we performed to assess the proposed metric, show improvements upon the state of the art in terms of correlation with human judgements and demonstrate its superior robustness to distractions.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Naeha_Sharif_NNEval_Neural_Network_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Naeha Sharif, Lyndon White, Mohammed Bennamoun, Syed Afaq Ali Shah
DCAN: Dual Channel-wise Alignment Networks for Unsupervised Scene Adaptation	Harvesting dense pixel-level annotations to train deep neural networks for semantic segmentation is extremely expensive and unwieldy at scale. While learning from synthetic data where labels are readily available sounds promising, performance degrades significantly when testing on novel realistic data due to domain discrepancies. We present Dual Channel-wise Alignment Networks (DCAN), a simple yet effective approach to reduce domain shift at both pixel-level and feature-level. Exploring statistics in each channel of CNN feature maps, our framework performs channel-wise feature alignment, which preserves spatial structures and semantic information, in both an image generator and a segmentation network. In particular, given an image from the source domain and unlabeled samples from the target domain, the generator synthesizes new images on-the-fly to resemble samples from the target domain in appearance and the segmentation network further refines high-level features before predicting semantic maps, both of which leverage feature statistics of sampled images from the target domain. Unlike much recent and concurrent work relying on adversarial training, our framework is lightweight and easy to train. Extensive experiments on adapting models trained on synthetic segmentation benchmarks to real urban scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zuxuan_Wu_DCAN_Dual_Channel-wise_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zuxuan Wu, Xintong Han, Yen-Liang Lin, Mustafa Gokhan Uzunbas, Tom Goldstein, Ser Nam Lim, Larry S.

3DFeat-Net: Weakly Supervised Local 3D Features for Point Cloud Registration	In this paper, we propose the 3DFeat-Net which learns both 3D feature detector and descriptor for point cloud matching using weak supervision. Unlike many existing works, we do not require manually annotating matching point clusters. Instead, we leverage on alignment and attention mechanisms to learn feature correspondences from GPS/INS tagged 3D point clouds without explicitly specifying them. We create training and benchmark outdoor Lidar datasets, and our experiments on these datasets show that our 3DFeat-Net outperforms existing handcrafted and learned 3D features.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zi_Jian_Yew_3DFeat-Net_Weakly_Supervised_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zi Jian Yew, Gim Hee Lee
Attention-based Ensemble for Deep Metric Learning	Recently, ensemble has been applied to deep metric learning to yield state-of-the-art results. Deep metric learning aims to learn deep neural networks for feature embeddings, distances of which satisfy given constraint. In deep metric learning, ensemble takes average of distances learned by multiple learners. As one important aspect of ensemble, the learners should be diverse in their feature embeddings. To this end, we propose an attention-based ensemble, which uses multiple attention masks, so that each learner can attend to different parts of the object. We also propose a divergence loss, which encourages diversity among the learners. The proposed method is applied to the standard benchmarks of deep metric learning and experimental results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on image retrieval tasks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Wonsik_Kim_Attention-based_Ensemble_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Wonsik Kim, Bhavya Goyal, Kunal Chawla, Jungmin Lee, Keunjoo Kwon
Learning Efficient Single-stage Pedestrian Detectors by Asymptotic Localization Fitting	Though Faster R-CNN based two-stage detectors have witnessed significant boost in pedestrian detection accuracy, it is still slow for practical applications. One solution is to simplify this working flow as a single-stage detector. However, current single-stage detectors (e.g. SSD) have not presented competitive accuracy on common pedestrian detection benchmarks. This paper is towards a successful pedestrian detector enjoying the speed of SSD while maintaining the accuracy of Faster R-CNN. Specifically, a structurally simple but effective module called emph{Asymptotic Localization Fitting} (ALF) is proposed, which stacks a series of predictors to directly evolve the default anchor boxes of SSD step by step into improving detection results. As a result, during training the latter predictors enjoy more and better-quality positive samples, meanwhile harder negatives could be mined with increasing IoU thresholds. On top of this, an efficient single-stage pedestrian detection architecture (denoted as ALFNet) is designed, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CityPersons and Caltech, two of the largest pedestrian detection benchmarks, and hence resulting in an attractive pedestrian detector in both accuracy and speed. Code is available at href{https://github.com/VideoObjectSearch/ALFNet}{https://github.com/VideoObjectSearch/ALFNet}.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Wei_Liu_Learning_Efficient_Single-stage_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Wei Liu, Shengcai Liao, Weidong Hu, Xuezhi Liang, Xiao Chen
Learning to Predict Crisp Boundaries	Recent methods for boundary or edge detection built on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) typically suffer from the issue of predicted edges being thick and need post-processing to obtain crisp boundaries. Highly imbalanced categories of boundary versus background in training data is one of main reasons for the above problem. In this work, the aim is to make CNNs produce sharp boundaries without post-processing. We introduce a novel loss for boundary detection, which is very effective for classifying imbalanced data and allows CNNs to produce crisp boundaries. Moreover, we propose an end-to-end network which adopts the bottom-up/top-down architecture to tackle the task. The proposed network effectively leverages hierarchical features and produces pixel-accurate boundary mask, which is critical to reconstruct the edge map. Our experiments illustrate that directly making crisp prediction not only promotes the visual results of CNNs, but also achieves better results against the state-of-the-art on the BSDS500 dataset (ODS F-score of .815) and the NYU Depth dataset (ODS F-score of .762).	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ruoxi_Deng_Learning_to_Predict_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ruoxi Deng, Chunhua Shen, Shengjun Liu, Huibing Wang, Xinru Liu
Domain Adaptation through Synthesis for Unsupervised Person Re-identification	Drastic variations in illumination across surveillance cameras make the person re-identification problem extremely challenging. Current large scale re-identification datasets have a significant number of training subjects, but lack diversity in lighting conditions. As a result, a trained model requires fine-tuning to become effective under an unseen illumination condition. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a new synthetic dataset that contains hundreds of illumination conditions. Specifically, we use 100 virtual humans illuminated with multiple HDR environment maps which accurately model realistic indoor and outdoor lighting. To achieve better accuracy in unseen illumination conditions we propose a novel domain adaptation technique that takes advantage of our synthetic data and performs fine-tuning in a completely unsupervised way. Our approach yields significantly higher accuracy than semi-supervised and unsupervised state-of-the-art methods, and is very competitive with supervised techniques.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Slawomir_Bak_Domain_Adaptation_through_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Slawomir Bak, Peter Carr, Jean-Francois Lalonde
Rethinking Spatiotemporal Feature Learning: Speed-Accuracy Trade-offs in Video Classification	Despite the steady progress in video analysis led by the adoption of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the relative improvement has been less drastic as that in 2D static image classification. Three main challenges exist including spatial (image) feature representation, temporal information representation, and model/computation complexity. It was recently shown by Carreira and Zisserman that 3D CNNs, inflated from 2D networks and pretrained on ImageNet, could be a promising way for spatial and temporal representation learning. However, as for model/computation complexity, 3D CNNs are much more expensive than 2D CNNs and prone to overfit. We seek a balance between speed and accuracy by building an effective and efficient video classification system through systematic exploration of critical network design choices. In particular, we show that it is possible to replace many of the 3D convolutions by low-cost 2D convolutions. Rather surprisingly, best result (in both speed and accuracy) is achieved when replacing the 3D convolutions at the bottom of the network, suggesting that temporal representation learning on high-level ``semantic'' features is more useful. Our conclusion generalizes to datasets with very different properties. When combined with several other cost-effective designs including separable spatial/temporal convolution and feature gating, our system results in an effective video classification system that that produces very competitive results on several action classification benchmarks (Kinetics, Something-something, UCF101 and HMDB), as well as two action detection (localization) benchmarks (JHMDB and UCF101-24).	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Saining_Xie_Rethinking_Spatiotemporal_Feature_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Saining Xie, Chen Sun, Jonathan Huang, Zhuowen Tu, Kevin Murphy
Look Deeper into Depth: Monocular Depth Estimation with Semantic Booster and Attention-Driven Loss	Monocular depth estimation benefits greatly from learning based techniques. By studying the training data, we observe that the per-pixel depth values in existing datasets typically exhibit a long-tailed distribution. However, most previous approaches treat all the regions in the training data equally regardless of the imbalanced depth distribution, which restricts the model performance particularly on distant depth regions. In this paper, we investigate the long tail property and delve deeper into the distant depth regions (i.e. the tail part) to propose an attention-driven loss for the network supervision. In addition, to better leverage the semantic information for monocular depth estimation, we propose a synergy network to automatically learn the information sharing strategies between the two tasks. With the proposed attention-driven loss and synergy network, the depth estimation and semantic labeling tasks can be mutually improved. Experiments on the challenging indoor dataset show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both monocular depth estimation and semantic labeling tasks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jianbo_Jiao_Look_Deeper_into_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jianbo Jiao, Ying Cao, Yibing Song, Rynson Lau
Super-Identity Convolutional Neural Network for Face Hallucination	Face hallucination is a generative task to super-resolve the facial image with low resolution while human perception of face heavily relies on identity information. However, previous face hallucination approaches largely ignore facial identity recovery. This paper proposes Super-Identity Convolutional Neural Network (SICNN) to recover identity information for generating faces closed to the real identity. Specifically, we define a super-identity loss to measure the identity difference between a hallucinated face and its corresponding high-resolution face within the hypersphere identity metric space. However, directly using this loss will lead to a Dynamic Domain Divergence problem, which is caused by the large margin between the high-resolution domain and the hallucination domain. To overcome this challenge, we present a domain-integrated training approach by constructing a robust identity metric for faces from these two domains. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed SICNN achieves superior visual quality over the state-of-the-art methods on a challenging task to super-resolve 12$ imes$14 faces with an 8$ imes$ upscaling factor. In addition, SICNN significantly improves the recognizability of ultra-low-resolution faces.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Kaipeng_Zhang_Super-Identity_Convolutional_Neural_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Kaipeng Zhang, Zhanpeng Zhang, Chia-Wen Cheng, Winston H.

PARN: Pyramidal Affine Regression Networks for Dense Semantic Correspondence	This paper presents a deep architecture for dense semantic correspondence, called pyramidal affine regression networks (PARN), that estimates locally-varying affine transformation fields across images. To deal with intra-class appearance and shape variations that commonly exist among different instances within the same object category, we leverage a pyramidal model where affine transformation fields are progressively estimated in a coarse-to-fine manner so that the smoothness constraint is naturally imposed within deep networks. PARN estimates residual affine transformations at each level and composes them to estimate final affine transformations. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of insufficient training data for semantic correspondence, we propose a novel weakly-supervised training scheme that generates progressive supervisions by leveraging a correspondence consistency across image pairs. Our method is fully learnable in an end-to-end manner and does not require quantizing infinite continuous affine transformation fields. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work that attempts to estimate dense affine transformation fields in a coarse-to-fine manner within deep networks. Experimental results demonstrate that PARN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for dense semantic correspondence on various benchmarks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Sangryul_Jeon_PARN_Pyramidal_Affine_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Sangryul Jeon, Seungryong Kim, Dongbo Min, Kwanghoon Sohn
TS2C: Tight Box Mining with Surrounding Segmentation Context for Weakly Supervised Object Detection	This work provides a simple approach to discover tight object bounding boxes with only image-level supervision, called Tight box mining with Surrounding Segmentation Context (TS2C). We observe that object candidates mined through current multiple instance learning methods are usually trapped to discriminative object parts, rather than the entire object. TS2C leverages surrounding segmentation context derived from weakly-supervised segmentation to suppress such low-quality distracting candidates and boost the high-quality ones. Specifically, TS2C is developed based on two key properties of desirable bounding boxes: 1) high purity, meaning most pixels in the box are with high object response, and 2) high completeness, meaning the box covers high object response pixels comprehensively. With such novel and computable criteria, more tight candidates can be discovered for learning a better object detector. With TS2C, we obtain 48.0% and 44.4% mAP scores on VOC 2007 and 2012 benchmarks, which are the new state-of-the-arts.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yunchao_Wei_TS2C_Tight_Box_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yunchao Wei, Zhiqiang Shen, Bowen Cheng, Honghui Shi, Jinjun Xiong, Jiashi Feng, Thomas Huang
Multi-Fiber Networks for Video Recognition	In this paper, we aim to reduce the computational cost of spatio-temporal deep neural networks, making them run as fast as their 2D counterparts while preserving state-of-the-art accuracy on video recognition benchmarks. To this end, we present the novel Multi-Fiber architecture that slices a complex neural network into an ensemble of lightweight networks or fibers that run through the network. To facilitate information flow between fibers we further incorporate multiplexer modules and end up with an architecture that reduces the computational cost of 3D networks by an order of magnitude, while increasing recognition performance at the same time. Extensive experimental results show that our multi-fiber architecture significantly boosts the efficiency of existing convolution networks for both image and video recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics datasets. Our proposed model requires over 9× and 13× less computations than the I3D and R(2+1)D models, respectively, yet providing higher accuracy.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yunpeng_Chen_Fast_Multi-fiber_Network_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yunpeng Chen, Yannis Kalantidis, Jianshu Li, Shuicheng Yan, Jiashi Feng
ICNet for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation on High-Resolution Images	We focus on the challenging task of real-time semantic segmentation in this paper.

Goal-Oriented Visual Question Generation via Intermediate Rewards	Despite significant progress in a variety of vision-and-language problems, developing a method capable of asking intelligent, goal-oriented questions about images is proven to be an inscrutable challenge. Towards this end, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework based on three new intermediate rewards, namely goal-achieved, progressive and informativeness that encourage the generation of succinct questions, which in turn uncover valuable information towards the overall goal. By directly optimizing for questions that work quickly towards fulfilling the overall goal, we avoid the tendency of existing methods to generate long series of inane queries that add little value. We evaluate our model on the GuessWhat?! dataset and show that the resulting questions can help a standard `Guesser' identify a specific object in an image at a much higher success rate.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Junjie_Zhang_Goal-Oriented_Visual_Question_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Junjie Zhang, Qi Wu, Chunhua Shen, Jian Zhang, Jianfeng Lu, Anton van den Hengel
C-WSL: Count-guided Weakly Supervised Localization	We introduce count-guided weakly supervised localization (C-WSL), an approach that uses per-class object count as a new form of supervision to improve weakly supervised localization (WSL). C-WSL uses a simple count-based region selection algorithm to select high-quality regions, each of which covers a single object instance during training, and improves existing WSL methods by training with the selected regions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of C-WSL, we integrate it into two WSL architectures and conduct extensive experiments on VOC2007 and VOC2012. Experimental results show that C-WSL leads to large improvements in WSL and that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The results of annotation experiments on VOC2007 suggest that a modest extra time is needed to obtain per-class object counts compared to labeling only object categories in an image. Furthermore, we reduce the annotation time by more than 2 times and 38 times compared to center-click and bounding-box annotations.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Mingfei_Gao_C-WSL_Count-guided_Weakly_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Mingfei Gao, Ang Li, Ruichi Yu, Vlad I.

Evaluating Capability of Deep Neural Networks for Image Classification via Information Plane	Inspired by the pioneering work of information bottleneck principle for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) analysis, we design an information plane based framework to evaluate the capability of DNNs for image classification tasks, which not only helps understand the capability of DNNs, but also helps us choose a neural network which leads to higher classification accuracy more efficiently. Further, with experiments, the relationship among the model accuracy, I(X;T) and I(T;Y) are analyzed, where I(X;T) and I(T;Y) are the mutual information of DNN's output T with input X and label Y. We also show the information plane is more informative than loss curve and apply mutual information to infer the model's capability for recognizing objects of each class. Our studies would facilitate a better understanding of DNNs.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hao_Cheng_Evaluating_Capability_of_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hao Cheng, Dongze Lian, Shenghua Gao, Yanlin Geng
Wasserstein Divergence for GANs	In many domains of computer vision, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved great success, among which the family of Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) is considered to be state-of-the-art due to the theoretical contributions and competitive qualitative performance. However, it is very challenging to approximate the k-Lipschitz constraint required by the Wasserstein-1 metric (W-met). In this paper, we propose a novel Wasserstein divergence (W-div), which is a relaxed version of W-met and does not require the k-Lipschitz constraint. As a concrete application, we introduce a Wasserstein divergence objective for GANs (WGAN-div), which can faithfully approximate W-div through optimization. Under various settings, including progressive growing training, we demonstrate the stability of the proposed WGAN-div owing to its theoretical and practical advantages over WGANs. Also, we study the quantitative and visual performance of WGAN-div on standard image synthesis benchmarks, showing the superior performance of WGAN-div compared to the state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jiqing_Wu_Wasserstein_Divergence_For_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jiqing Wu, Zhiwu Huang, Janine Thoma, Dinesh Acharya, Luc Van Gool
ESPNet: Efficient Spatial Pyramid of Dilated Convolutions for Semantic Segmentation	We introduce a fast and efficient convolutional neural network, ESPNet, for semantic segmentation of high resolution images under resource constraints. ESPNet is based on a new convolutional module, efficient spatial pyramid (ESP), which is efficient in terms of computation, memory, and power. ESPNet is 22 times faster (on a standard GPU) and 180 times smaller than the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation network PSPNet, while its category-wise accuracy is only 8% less. We evaluated EPSNet on a variety of semantic segmentation datasets including Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC, and a breast biopsy whole slide image dataset. Under the same constraints on memory and computation, ESPNet outperforms all the current efficient CNN networks such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and ENet on both standard metrics and our newly introduced performance metrics that measure efficiency on edge devices. Our network can process high resolution images at a rate of 112 and 9 frames per second on a standard GPU and edge device, respectively.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Sachin_Mehta_ESPNet_Efficient_Spatial_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Sachin Mehta, Mohammad Rastegari, Anat Caspi, Linda Shapiro, Hannaneh Hajishirzi
Meta-Tracker: Fast and Robust Online Adaptation for Visual Object Trackers	This paper improves state-of-the-art visual object trackers that use online adaptation. Our core contribution is an offline meta-learning-based method to adjust the initial deep networks used in online adaptation-based tracking. The meta learning is driven by the goal of deep networks that can quickly be adapted to robustly model a particular target in future frames. Ideally the resulting models focus on features that are useful for future frames, and avoid overfitting to background clutter, small parts of the target, or noise. By enforcing a small number of update iterations during meta-learning, the resulting networks train significantly faster. We demonstrate this approach on top of the high performance tracking approaches: tracking-by-detection based MDNet and the correlation based CREST. Experimental results on standard benchmarks, OTB2015 and VOT2016, show that our meta-learned versions of both trackers improve speed, accuracy, and robustness.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Eunbyung_Park_Meta-Tracker_Fast_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Eunbyung Park, Alexander C.

Riemannian Walk for Incremental Learning: Understanding Forgetting and Intransigence	Incremental learning (IL) has received a lot of attention recently, however, the literature lacks a precise problem definition, proper evaluation settings, and metrics tailored specifically for the IL problem. One of the main objectives of this work is to fill these gaps so as to provide a common ground for better understanding of IL. The main challenge for an IL algorithm is to update the classifier whilst preserving existing knowledge. We observe that, in addition to forgetting, a known issue while preserving knowledge, IL also suffers from a problem we call intransigence, its inability to update knowledge. We introduce two metrics to quantify forgetting and intransigence that allow us to understand, analyse, and gain better insights into the behaviour of IL algorithms. Furthermore, we present RWalk, a generalization of EWC++ (our efficient version of EWC) and Path Integral with a theoretically grounded KL-divergence based perspective. We provide a thorough analysis of various IL algorithms on MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets. In these experiments, RWalk obtains superior results in terms of accuracy, and also provides a better trade-off for forgetting and intransigence.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Arslan_Chaudhry__Riemannian_Walk_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Arslan Chaudhry, Puneet K.

DeepIM: Deep Iterative Matching for 6D Pose Estimation	Estimating the 6D pose of objects from images is an important problem in various applications such as robot manipulation and virtual reality. While direct regression of images to object poses has limited accuracy, matching rendered images of an object against the input image can produce accurate results. In this work, we propose a novel deep neural network for 6D pose matching named DeepIM. Given an initial pose estimation, our network is able to iteratively refine the pose by matching the rendered image with the input image. The network is trained to predict a relative pose transformation using an untangled representation of 3D location and 3D orientation and an iterative training process. Experiments on two commonly used benchmarks for 6D pose estimation demonstrate that DeepIM achieves large improvements over state-of-the-art methods. We furthermore show that DeepIM is able to match previously unseen objects.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yi_Li_DeepIM_Deep_Iterative_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yi Li, Gu Wang, Xiangyang Ji, Yu Xiang, Dieter Fox
A Dataset for Lane Instance Segmentation in Urban Environments	Autonomous vehicles require knowledge of the surrounding road layout, which can be predicted by state-of-the-art CNNs. This work addresses the current lack of data for determining lane instances, which are needed for various driving manoeuvres. The main issue is the time-consuming manual labelling process, typically applied per image. We notice that driving the car is itself a form of annotation. Therefore, we propose a semi-automated method that allows for efficient labelling of image sequences by utilising an estimated road plane in 3D based on where the car has driven and projecting labels from this plane into all images of the sequence. The average labelling time per image is reduced to 5 seconds and only an inexpensive dash-cam is required for data capture. We are releasing a dataset of 24,000 images and additionally show experimental semantic segmentation and instance segmentation results.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Brook_Roberts_A_Dataset_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Brook Roberts, Sebastian Kaltwang, Sina Samangooei, Mark Pender-Bare, Konstantinos Tertikas, John Redford
Towards Human-Level License Plate Recognition	License plate recognition (LPR) is a fundamental component of various intelligent transport systems, which is always expected to be accurate and efficient enough. In this paper, we propose a novel LPR framework consisting of semantic segmentation and character counting, towards achieving human-level performance. Benefiting from innovative structure, our method can recognize a whole license plate once rather than conducting character detection or sliding window followed by per-character recognition. Moreover, our method can achieve higher recognition accuracy due to more effectively exploiting global information and avoiding sensitive character detection, and is time-saving due to eliminating one-by-one character recognition. Finally, we experimentally verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on two public datasets (AOLP and Media Lab) and our License Plate Dataset. The results demonstrate our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods, and achieves the accuracies of more than 99% for almost all settings.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jiafan_Zhuang_Towards_Human-Level_License_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jiafan Zhuang, Saihui Hou, Zilei Wang, Zheng-Jun Zha
BodyNet: Volumetric Inference of 3D Human Body Shapes	Human shape estimation is an important task for video editing, animation and fashion industry. Predicting 3D human body shape from natural images, however, is highly challenging due to factors such as variation in human bodies, clothing and viewpoint. Prior methods addressing this problem typically attempt to fit parametric body models with certain priors on pose and shape. In this work we argue for an alternative representation and propose BodyNet, a neural network for direct inference of volumetric body shape from a single image. BodyNet is an end-to-end trainable network that benefits from (i) a volumetric 3D loss, (ii) a multi-view re-projection loss, and (iii) intermediate supervision of 2D pose, 2D body part segmentation, and 3D pose. Each of them results in performance improvement as demonstrated by our experiments. To evaluate the method, we fit the SMPL model to our network output and show state-of-the-art results on the SURREAL and Unite the People datasets, outperforming recent approaches. Besides achieving state-of-the-art performance, our method also enables volumetric body-part segmentation.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Gul_Varol_BodyNet_Volumetric_Inference_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Gul Varol, Duygu Ceylan, Bryan Russell, Jimei Yang, Ersin Yumer, Ivan Laptev, Cordelia Schmid
Less is More: Picking Informative Frames for Video Captioning	In video captioning task, the best practice has been achieved by attention-based models which associate salient visual components with sentences in the video. However, existing study follows a common procedure which includes a frame-level appearance modeling and motion modeling on equal interval frame sampling, which may bring about redundant visual information, sensitivity to content noise and unnecessary computation cost. We propose a plug-and-play PickNet to perform informative frame picking in video captioning. Based on a standard encoder-decoder framework, we develop a reinforcement-learning-based procedure to train the network sequentially, where the reward of each frame picking action is designed by maximizing visual diversity and minimizing discrepancy between generated caption and the ground-truth. The rewarded candidate will be selected and the corresponding latent representation of encoder-decoder will be updated for future trials. This procedure goes on until the end of the video sequence. Consequently, a compact frame subset can be selected to represent the visual information and perform video captioning without performance degradation. Experiment results show that our model can achieve competitive performance across popular benchmarks while only 6~8 frames are used.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yangyu_Chen_Less_is_More_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yangyu Chen, Shuhui Wang, Weigang Zhang, Qingming Huang
Improving Deep Visual Representation for Person Re-identification by Global and Local Image-language Association	Person re-identification is an important task that requires learning discriminative visual features for distinguishing different person identities. Diverse auxiliary information has been utilized to improve the visual feature learning. In this paper, we propose to exploit natural language description as additional training supervisions for more effective features. Compared with other auxiliary information, language can describe a specific person from more compact and semantic visual aspects, thus is complementary to the pixel-level image data. Our method not only learns better global visual feature with the supervision of the overall description but also enforces semantic consistencies between local visual and linguistic features, which is achieved by building global and local image-language associations. The global image-language association is established according to the identity labels, while the local association is based upon the implicit correspondences between image regions and noun phrases. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of employing language as training supervisions with the two association schemes. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without utilizing any auxiliary information during testing and shows better performance than other joint embedding methods for the image-language association.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Dapeng_Chen_Improving_Deep_Visual_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Dapeng Chen, Hongsheng Li, Xihui Liu, Yantao Shen, Jing Shao, Zejian Yuan, Xiaogang Wang
Learning to Zoom: a Saliency-Based Sampling Layer for Neural Networks	We introduce a saliency-based distortion layer for convolutional neural networks that helps to improve the spatial sampling of input data for a given task. Our differentiable layer can be added as a preprocessing block to existing task networks and trained altogether in an end-to-end fashion. The effect of the layer is to efficiently estimate how to sample from the original data in order to boost task performance. For example, for an image classification task in which the original data might range in size up to several megapixels, but where the desired input images to the task network are much smaller, our layer learns how best to sample from the underlying high resolution data in a manner which preserves task-relevant information better than uniform downsampling. This has the effect of creating distorted, caricature-like intermediate images, in which idiosyncratic elements of the image that improve task performance are zoomed and exaggerated. Unlike alternative approaches such as spatial transformer networks, our proposed layer is inspired by image saliency, computed efficiently from uniformly downsampled data, and degrades gracefully to a uniform sampling strategy under uncertainty. We apply our layer to improve existing networks for the tasks of human gaze estimation and fine-grained object classification. Code for our method is available in: http://github.com/recasens/Saliency-Sampler	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Adria_Recasens_Learning_to_Zoom_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Adria Recasens, Petr Kellnhofer, Simon Stent, Wojciech Matusik, Antonio Torralba
A-Contrario Horizon-First Vanishing Point Detection Using Second-Order Grouping Laws	We show that, in images of man-made environments, the horizon line can usually be hypothesized based on an a contrario detection of second-order grouping events. This allows constraining the extraction of the horizontal vanishing points on that line, thus reducing false detections. Experiments made on three datasets show that our method, not only achieves state-of-the-art performance w.r.t. horizon line detection on two datasets, but also yields much less spurious vanishing points than the previous top-ranked methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Gilles_Simon_A_Contrario_Horizon-First_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Gilles Simon, Antoine Fond, Marie-Odile Berger
Stereo relative pose from line and point feature triplets	Stereo relative pose problem lies at the core of stereo visual odometry systems that are used in many applications. In this work we present two minimal solvers for stereo relative pose. We specifically con- sider the case when a minimal set consist of three point or line features and each of them has three known projections on two stereo cameras. We validate the importance of this formulation for practical purposes in our experiments with motion estimation. We then present a complete classi- fication of minimal cases with three point or line correspondences each having three projections, and present two new solvers that can handle all such cases. We demonstrate a considerable effect from the integration of the new solvers into a visual SLAM system.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Alexander_Vakhitov_Stereo_relative_pose_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Alexander Vakhitov, Victor Lempitsky, Yinqiang Zheng
Neural Graph Matching Networks for Fewshot 3D Action Recognition	We propose Neural Graph Matching (NGM) Networks, a novel framework that can learn to recognize a previous unseen 3D action class with only a few examples. We achieve this by leveraging the inherent structure of 3D data through a graphical representation. This allows us to modularize our model and lead to strong data-efficiency in few-shot learning. More specifically, NGM Networks jointly learn a graph generator and a graph matching metric function in a end-to-end fashion to directly optimize the few-shot learning objective. We evaluate NGM on two 3D action recognition datasets, CAD-120 and PiGraphs, and show that learning to generate and match graphs both lead to significant improvement of few-shot 3D action recognition over the holistic baselines.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Michelle_Guo_Neural_Graph_Matching_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Michelle Guo, Edward Chou, De-An Huang, Shuran Song, Serena Yeung, Li Fei-Fei
Proxy Clouds for Live RGB-D Stream Processing and Consolidation	We propose a new multiplanar superstructure for unified real-time processing of RGB-D data. Modern RGB-D sensors are widely used for indoor 3D capture, with applications ranging from modeling to robotics, through augmented reality. Nevertheless, their use is limited by their low resolution, with frames often corrupted with noise, missing data and temporal inconsistencies. Our approach, named Proxy Clouds, consists in generating and updating through time a single set of compact local statistics parameterized over detected planar proxies, which are fed from raw RGB-D data. Proxy Clouds provide several processing primitives, which improve the quality of the RGB-D stream on-the-fly or lighten further operations. Experimental results confirm that our light weight analysis framework copes well with embedded execution as well as moderate memory and computational capabilities compared to state-of-the-art methods. Processing of RGB-D data with Proxy Clouds includes noise and temporal flickering removal, hole filling and resampling. As a substitute of the observed scene, our proxy cloud can additionally be applied to compression and scene reconstruction. We present experiments performed with our framework in indoor scenes of different natures within a recent open RGB-D dataset.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Adrien_Kaiser_Proxy_Clouds_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Adrien Kaiser, Jose Alonso Ybanez Zepeda, Tamy Boubekeur
ECO: Efficient Convolutional Network for Online Video Understanding	The state of the art in video understanding suffers from two problems: (1) The major part of reasoning is performed locally in the video, thus missing important relationships within actions that span several seconds. (2) While there are local methods with fast per-frame processing, the processing of the whole video is not efficient and hampers fast video retrieval or online classification of long-term activities. In this paper, we introduce a network architecture that takes long-term content into account and enables fast per-video processing at the same time. The architecture is based on merging long-term content already in the network rather than in a post-hoc fusion. Together with a sampling strategy, which exploits that neighboring frames are largely redundant, this yields high-quality action classification and video captioning at up to 230 videos per second, where each video can consist of a few hundred frames. The approach achieves competitive performance across all datasets while being 10x to 80x faster than state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Mohammadreza_Zolfaghari_ECO_Efficient_Convolutional_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Mohammadreza Zolfaghari, Kamaljeet Singh, Thomas Brox
Deep Randomized Ensembles for Metric Learning	Learning embedding functions, which map semantically related inputs to nearby locations in a feature space supports a variety of classification and information retrieval tasks. In this work, we propose a novel, generalizable and fast method to define a family of embedding functions that can be used as an ensemble to give improved results. Each embedding function is learned by randomly bagging the training labels into small subsets. We show experimentally that these embedding ensembles create effective embedding functions. The ensemble output defines a metric space that improves state of the art performance for image retrieval on CUB-200-2011, Cars-196, In-Shop Clothes Retrieval and VehicleID.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hong_Xuan_Randomized_Ensemble_Embeddings_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hong Xuan, Richard Souvenir, Robert Pless
LQ-Nets: Learned Quantization for Highly Accurate and Compact Deep Neural Networks	Although weight and activation quantization is an effective approach for Deep Neural Network (DNN) compression and has a lot of potentials to increase inference speed leveraging bit-operations, there is still a noticeable gap in terms of prediction accuracy between the quantized model and the full-precision model. To address this gap, we propose to jointly train a quantized, bit-operation-compatible DNN and its associated quantizers, as opposed to using fixed, handcrafted quantization schemes such as uniform or logarithmic quantization. Our method for learning the quantizers applies to both network weights and activations with arbitrary-bit precision, and our quantizers are easy to train. The comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets show that our method works consistently well for various network structures such as AlexNet, VGG-Net, GoogLeNet, ResNet, and DenseNet, surpassing previous quantization methods in terms of accuracy by an appreciable margin.

Hand Pose Estimation via Latent 2.5D Heatmap Regression	Estimating the 3D pose of a hand is an essential part of human-computer interaction. Estimating 3D pose using depth or multi-view sensors has become easier with recent advances in computer vision, however, regressing pose from a single RGB image is much less straightforward. The main difficulty arises from the fact that 3D pose requires some form of depth estimates, which are ambiguous given only an RGB image. In this paper we propose a new method for 3D hand pose estimation from a monocular image through a novel 2.5D pose representation. Our new representation estimates pose up to a scaling factor, which can be estimated additionally if a prior of the hand size is given. We implicitly learn depth maps and heatmap distributions with a novel CNN architecture. Our system achieves the state-of-the-art estimation of 2D and 3D hand pose on several challenging datasets in presence of severe occlusions.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Umar_Iqbal_Hand_Pose_Estimation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Umar Iqbal, Pavlo Molchanov, Thomas Breuel Juergen Gall, Jan Kautz
Training Binary Weight Networks via Semi-Binary Decomposition	Recently binary weight networks have attracted lots of attentions due to their high computational efficiency and small parameter size. Yet they still suffer from large accuracy drops because of their limited representation capacity. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-binary decomposition method which decomposes a matrix into two binary matrices and a diagonal matrix. Since the matrix product of binary matrices has more numerical values than binary matrix, the proposed semi-binary decomposition has more representation capacity. Besides, we propose an alternating optimization method to solve the semi-binary decomposition problem while keeping binary constraints. Extensive experiments on AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (5 percentage higher in top1 accuracy). We also implement binary weight AlexNet on FPGA platform, which shows that our proposed method can achieve $sim 9 imes$ speed-ups while reducing the consumption of on-chip memory and dedicated multipliers significantly.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Qinghao_Hu_Training_Binary_Weight_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Qinghao Hu, Gang Li, Peisong Wang, Yifan Zhang, Jian Cheng
Robust Anchor Embedding for Unsupervised Video Person Re-Identification in the Wild	This paper addresses the scalability and robustness issues of estimating labels from imbalanced unlabeled data for unsupervised video-based person re-identification (re-ID). To achieve it, we propose a novel Robust AnChor Embedding (RACE) framework via deep feature representation learning for large-scale unsupervised video re-ID. Within this framework, anchor sequences representing different persons are firstly selected to formulate an anchor graph which also initializes the CNN model to get discriminative feature representations for later label estimation. To accurately estimate labels from unlabeled sequences with noisy frames, robust anchor embedding is introduced based on the regularized affine hull. Efficiency is ensured with kNN anchors embedding instead of the whole anchor set under manifold assumptions. After that, a robust and efficient top-k counts label prediction strategy is proposed to predict the labels of unlabeled image sequences. With the newly estimated labeled sequences, the unified anchor embedding framework enables the feature learning process to be further facilitated. Extensive experimental results on the large-scale dataset show that the proposed method outperforms existing unsupervised video re-ID methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Mang_YE_Robust_Anchor_Embedding_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Mang Ye, Xiangyuan Lan, Pong C.

Multi-view to Novel view: Synthesizing novel views with Self-Learned Confidence	In this paper, we address the task of multi-view novel view synthesis, where we are interested in synthesizing a target image with an arbitrary camera pose from given source images. We propose an end-to-end trainable framework that learns to exploit multiple viewpoints to synthesize a novel view without any 3D supervision. Specifically, our model consists of a flow prediction module and a pixel generation module to directly leverage information presented in source views as well as hallucinate missing pixels from statistical priors. To merge the predictions produced by the two modules given multi-view source images, we introduce a self-learned confidence aggregation mechanism. We evaluate our model on images rendered from 3D object models as well as real and synthesized scenes. We demonstrate that our model is able to achieve state-of-the-art results as well as progressively improve its predictions when more source images are available.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Shao-Hua_Sun_Multi-view_to_Novel_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Shao-Hua Sun, Minyoung Huh, Yuan-Hong Liao, Ning Zhang, Joseph J.

Coded Illumination and Imaging for Fluorescence Based Classification	The quick detection of specific substances in objects such as produce items via non-destructive visual cues is vital to ensuring the quality and safety of consumer products. At the same time, it is well-known that the fluorescence excitation-emission characteristics of many organic objects can serve as a kind of ``fingerprint'' for detecting the presence of specific substances in classification tasks such as determining if something is safe to consume. However, conventional capture of the fluorescence excitation-emission matrix can take on the order of minutes and can only be done for point measurements. In this paper, we propose a coded illumination approach whereby light spectra are learned such that key visual fluorescent features can be easily seen for material classification. We show that under a single coded illuminant, we can capture one RGB image and perform pixel-level classifications of materials at high accuracy. This is demonstrated through effective classification of different types of honey and alcohol using real images.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yuta_Asano_Coded_Illumination_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yuta Asano, Misaki Meguro, Chao Wang, Antony Lam, Yinqiang Zheng, Takahiro Okabe, Imari Sato
Reconstruction-based Pairwise Depth Dataset for Depth Image Enhancement Using CNN	Raw depth images captured by consumer depth cameras suffer from noisy and missing values. Despite the success of CNN-based image processing on color image restoration, similar approaches for depth enhancement have not been much addressed yet because of the lack of raw-clean pairwise dataset. In this paper, we propose a pairwise depth image dataset generation method using dense 3D surface reconstruction with a filtering method to remove low quality pairs. We also present a multi-scale Laplacian pyramid based neural network and structure preserving loss functions to progressively reduce the noise and holes from coarse to fine scales. Experimental results show that our network trained with our pairwise dataset can enhance the input depth images to become comparable with 3D reconstructions obtained from depth streams, and can accelerate the convergence of dense 3D reconstruction results.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Junho_Jeon_Reconstruction-based_Pairwise_Depth_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Junho Jeon, Seungyong Lee
Factorizable Net: An Efficient Subgraph-based Framework for Scene Graph Generation	Generating scene graph to describe all the relations inside an image gains increasing interests these years. However, most of the previous methods use complicated structures with slow inference speed or rely on the external data, which limits the usage of the model in real-life scenarios. To improve the efficiency of scene graph generation, we propose a subgraph-based connection graph to concisely represent the scene graph during the inference. A bottom-up clustering method is first used to factorize the entire scene graph into subgraphs, where each subgraph contains several objects and a subset of their relationships. By replacing the numerous relationship representations of the scene graph with fewer subgraph and object features, the computation in the intermediate stage is significantly reduced. In addition, spatial information is maintained by the subgraph features, which is leveraged by our proposed Spatial-weighted Message Passing (SMP) structure and Spatial-sensitive Relation Inference (SRI) module to facilitate the relationship recognition. On the recent Visual Relationship Detection and Visual Genome datasets, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method in both accuracy and speed.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yikang_LI_Factorizable_Net_An_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yikang Li, Wanli Ouyang, Bolei Zhou, Jianping Shi, Chao Zhang, Xiaogang Wang
Pixel2Mesh: Generating 3D Mesh Models from Single RGB Images	We propose an end-to-end deep learning architecture that produces a 3D shape in triangular mesh from a single color image. Limited by the nature of deep neural network, previous methods usually represent a 3D shape in volume or point cloud, and it is non-trivial to convert them to the more ready-to-use mesh model. Unlike the existing methods, our network represents 3D mesh in a graph-based convolutional neural network and produces correct geometry by progressively deforming an ellipsoid, leveraging perceptual features extracted from the input image. We adopt a coarse-to-fine strategy to make the whole deformation procedure stable, and define various of mesh related losses to capture properties of different levels to guarantee visually appealing and physically accurate 3D geometry. Extensive experiments show that our method not only qualitatively produces mesh model with better details, but also achieves higher 3D shape estimation accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Nanyang_Wang_Pixel2Mesh_Generating_3D_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Nanyang Wang, Yinda Zhang, Zhuwen Li, Yanwei Fu, Wei Liu, Yu-Gang Jiang

Snap Angle Prediction for 360° Panoramas	360° panoramas are a rich medium, yet notoriously difficult to visualize in the 2D image plane. We explore how intelligent rotations of a spherical image may enable content-aware projection with fewer perceptible distortions. Whereas existing approaches assume the viewpoint is fixed, intuitively some viewing angles within the sphere preserve high-level objects better than others. To discover the relationship between these optimal emph{snap angles} and the spherical panorama's content, we develop a reinforcement learning approach for the cubemap projection model. Implemented as a deep recurrent neural network, our method selects a sequence of rotation actions and receives reward for avoiding cube boundaries that overlap with important foreground objects. Our results demonstrate the impact both qualitatively and quantitatively.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Bo_Xiong_Snap_Angle_Prediction_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Bo Xiong, Kristen Grauman
Summarizing First-Person Videos from Third Persons' Points of View	Video highlight or summarization is among interesting topics in computer vision, which benefits a variety of applications like viewing, searching, or storage. However, most existing studies rely on training data of third-person videos, which cannot easily generalize to highlight the first-person ones. With the goal of deriving an effective model to summarize first-person videos, we propose a novel deep neural network architecture for describing and discriminating vital spatiotemporal information across videos with different points of view. Our proposed model is realized in a semi-supervised setting, in which fully annotated third-person videos, unlabeled first-person videos, and a small amount of annotated first-person ones are presented during training. In our experiments, qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both benchmarks and our collected first-person video datasets are presented.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/HSUAN-I_HO_Summarizing_First-Person_Videos_ECCV_2018_paper.php	HSUAN-I HO, Wei-Chen Chiu, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang
Small-scale Pedestrian Detection Based on Topological Line Localization and Temporal Feature Aggregation	A critical issue in pedestrian detection is to detect small-scale objects that will introduce feeble contrast and motion blur in images and videos, which in our opinion should partially resort to deep-rooted annotation bias. Motivated by this, we propose a novel method integrated with somatic topological line localization (TLL) and temporal feature aggregation for detecting multi-scale pedestrians, which works particularly well with small-scale pedestrians that are relatively far from the camera. Moreover, a post-processing scheme based on Markov Ran- dom Field (MRF) is introduced to eliminate ambiguities in occlusion cases. Applying with these methodologies comprehensively, we achieve best detection performance on Caltech benchmark and improve performance of small-scale objects signicantly (miss rate decreases from 74.53% to 60.79%). Beyond this, we also achieve competitive performance on CityPersons dataset and show the existence of annotation bias in KITTI dataset.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tao_Song_Small-scale_Pedestrian_Detection_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tao Song, Leiyu Sun, Di Xie, Haiming Sun, Shiliang Pu
CNN-PS: CNN-based Photometric Stereo for General Non-Convex Surfaces	Most conventional photometric stereo algorithms inversely solve a BRDF-based image formation model. However, the actual imaging process is often far more complex due to the global light transport on the non-convex surfaces. This paper presents a photometric stereo network that directly learns relationships between the photometric stereo input and surface normals of a scene. For handling unordered, arbitrary number of input images, we merge all the input data to the intermediate representation called {it observation map} that has a fixed shape, is able to be fed into a CNN. To improve both training and prediction phases, we take into account the rotational pseudo-invariance of the observation map that is derived from the isotropic constraint. For training the network, we create a synthetic photometric stereo dataset that is generated by a physics-based renderer, therefore the global light transport is considered. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that our method outperforms conventional BRDF-based photometric stereo algorithms especially when scenes are highly non-convex.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ikehata_CNN-PS_CNN-based_Photometric_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Satoshi Ikehata
Action Anticipation with RBF Kernelized Feature Mapping RNN	We introduce a novel Recurrent Neural Network-based algorithm for future video feature generation and action anticipation called ame. Our novel RNN architecture builds upon three effective principles of machine learning, 1. parameter sharing, 2. Radial basis function kernels and 3. Adversarial training. Using only a fraction of earliest frames of a video, we are able to generate accurate future features thanks to the generelization capacity of our novel RNN. Using a simple two layered MLP facilitated with a RBF kernel layer, we classify generated future features for the action anticipation. In our experiments, we obtain 18% improvement on JHMDB-21 dataset, 6% on UCF101-24 and 13% improvement on UT-Interaction datasets over prior state-of-the-art for action anticipation.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yuge_Shi_Action_Anticipation_with_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yuge Shi, Basura Fernando, Richard Hartley
Deep Structure Inference Network for Facial Action Unit Recognition	Facial expressions are combinations of basic components called Action Units (AU). Facial expressions are combinations of basic components called Action Units (AU). Recognizing AUs is key for developing general facial expression analysis. In recent years, most efforts in automatic AU recognition have been dedicated to learning combinations of local features and to exploiting correlations between Action Units. In this paper, we propose a deep neural architecture that tackles both problems by combining learned local and global features in its initial stages and replicating a message passing algorithm between classes similar to a graphical model inference approach in later stages. We show that by training the model end-to-end with increased supervision we improve state-of-the-art by 5.3% and 8.2% performance on BP4D and DISFA datasets, respectively.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ciprian_Corneanu_Deep_Structure_Inference_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ciprian Corneanu, Meysam Madadi, Sergio Escalera
Imagine This! Scripts to Compositions to Videos	Imagining a scene described in natural language with realistic layout and appearance of entities is the ultimate test of spatial, visual, and semantic world knowledge. As a step towards this goal, we present the Composition Retrieval and Fusion Networks (CRAFT), a model capable of learning this knowledge from video-caption data and applying it for generating videos from novel captions. CRAFT explicitly predicts a temporal-layout of mentioned entities (characters and objects), retrieves spatio-temporal entity segments from a video database and fuses them to generate scene videos. Our modeling contributions include sequential training of components of CRAFT while jointly modeling layout and appearances, and losses that encourage learning compositional representations for retrieval. We evaluate CRAFT on semantic fidelity to caption, composition consistency and visual quality. CRAFT outperforms direct pixel generation approaches and generalizes well to unseen captions as well as unseen video databases with no text annotations. We demonstrate CRAFT on FLINTSTONES, a new richly annotated video-caption dataset with over 25000 videos.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tanmay_Gupta_Imagine_This_Scripts_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tanmay Gupta, Dustin Schwenk, Ali Farhadi, Derek Hoiem, Aniruddha Kembhavi
Unsupervised Class-Specific Deblurring	In this paper, we present an end-to-end deblurring network designed specifically for a class of data. Unlike the prior supervised deep-learning works that extensively rely on large sets of paired data, which is highly demanding and challenging to obtain, we propose an unsupervised training scheme with unpaired data to achieve the same. Our model consists of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that learns a strong prior on the clean image domain using adversarial loss and maps the blurred image to its clean equivalent. To improve the stability of GAN and to preserve the image correspondence, we introduce an additional CNN module that reblurs the generated GAN output to match with the blurred input. Along with these two modules, we also make use of the blurred image itself to self-guide the network to constrain the solution space of generated clean images. This self-guidance is achieved by imposing a scale-space gradient error with an additional gradient module. We train our model on different classes and observe that adding the reblur and gradient modules help in better convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art supervised methods on both synthetic and real-world images even in the absence of any supervision.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Nimisha_T_M_Unsupervised_Class-Specific_Deblurring_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Thekke Madam Nimisha, Kumar Sunil, A.

Asynchronous, Photometric Feature Tracking using Events and Frames	"We present a method that leverages the complementarity of event cameras and standard cameras to track visual features with low-latency. Event cameras are novel sensors that output pixel-level brightness changes, called ""events"". They offer significant advantages over standard cameras, namely a very high dynamic range, no motion blur, and a latency in the order of microseconds. However, because the same scene pattern can produce different events depending on the motion direction, establishing event correspondences across time is challenging. By contrast, standard cameras provide intensity measurements (frames) that do not depend on motion direction. Our method extracts features on frames and subsequently tracks them asynchronously using events, thereby exploiting the best of both types of data: the frames provide a photometric representation that does not depend on motion direction and the events provide low-latency updates. In contrast to previous works, which are based on heuristics, this is the first principled method that uses raw intensity measurements directly, based on a generative event model within a maximum-likelihood framework. As a result, our method produces feature tracks that are both more accurate (subpixel accuracy) and longer than the state of the art, across a wide variety of scenes."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Daniel_Gehrig_Asynchronous_Photometric_Feature_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Daniel Gehrig, Henri Rebecq, Guillermo Gallego, Davide Scaramuzza
Zero-Shot Object Detection	We introduce and tackle the problem of zero-shot object detection (ZSD), which aims to detect object classes which are not observed during training. We work with a challenging set of object classes, not restricting ourselves to similar and/or fine-grained categories as in prior works on zero-shot classification. We present a principled approach by first adapting visual-semantic embeddings for ZSD. We then discuss the problems associated with selecting a background class and motivate two background-aware approaches for learning robust detectors. One of these models uses a fixed background class and the other is based on iterative latent assignments. We also outline the challenge associated with using a limited number of training classes and propose a solution based on dense sampling of the semantic label space using auxiliary data with a large number of categories. We propose novel splits of two standard detection datasets – MSCOCO and VisualGenome, and present extensive empirical results in both the traditional and generalized zero-shot settings to highlight the benefits of the proposed methods. We provide useful insights into the algorithm and conclude by posing some open questions to encourage further research.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ankan_Bansal_Zero-Shot_Object_Detection_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ankan Bansal, Karan Sikka, Gaurav Sharma, Rama Chellappa, Ajay Divakaran
Deep Attention Neural Tensor Network for Visual Question Answering	Visual question answering (VQA) has drawn great attention in cross-modal learning problems, which enables a machine to answer a natural language question given a reference image. Significant progress has been made by learning rich embedding features from images and questions by bilinear models, while neglects the key role from answers. In this paper, we propose a novel deep attention neural tensor network (DA-NTN) for visual question answering, which can discover the joint correlations over images, questions and answers with tensor-based representations. First, we model one of the pairwise interaction (e.g., image and question) by bilinear features, which is further encoded with the third dimension (e.g., answer) to be a triplet by bilinear tensor product. Second, we decompose the correlation of different triplets by different answer and question types, and further propose a slice-wise attention module on tensor to select the most discriminative reasoning process for inference. Third, we optimize the proposed DA-NTN by learning a label regression with KL-divergence losses. Such a design enables scalable training and fast convergence over a large number of answer set. We integrate the proposed DA-NTN structure into the state-of-the-art VQA models (e.g., MLB and MUTAN). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior accuracy than the original MLB and MUTAN models, with 1.98%, 1.70% relative increases on VQA-2.0 dataset, respectively.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yalong_Bai_Deep_Attention_Neural_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yalong Bai, Jianlong Fu, Tiejun Zhao, Tao Mei
Selective Zero-Shot Classification with Augmented Attributes	In this paper, we introduce a selective zero-shot classification problem: how can the classifier avoid making dubious predictions? Existing attribute-based zero-shot classification methods are shown to work poorly in the selective classification scenario. We argue the under-complete human defined attribute vocabulary accounts for the poor performance. We propose a selective zero-shot classifier based on both the human defined and the automatically discovered residual attributes. The proposed classifier is constructed by firstly learning the defined and the residual attributes jointly. Then the predictions are conducted within the subspace of the defined attributes. Finally, the prediction confidence is measured by both the defined and the residual attributes. Experiments conducted on several benchmarks demonstrate that our classifier produces a superior performance to other methods under the risk-coverage trade-off metric.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jie_Song_Selective_Zero-Shot_Classification_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jie Song, Chengchao Shen, Jie Lei, An-Xiang Zeng, Kairi Ou, Dacheng Tao, Mingli Song
Structured Siamese Network for Real-Time Visual Tracking	Local structure of target objects are essential for robust tracking. However, existing methods based on deep neural networks mostly describe the target appearance from the global view, leading to high sensitivity to non-rigid appearance change and partial occlusion. In this paper, we circumvent this issue by proposing a local structure learning method, which simultaneously considers the local patterns of the target and their structural relationships for more accurate target tracking. To this end, a local pattern detection module is designed to automatically identify discriminative regions of the target objects. The detection results are further refined by a message passing module, which enforces the structural context among local patterns to construct local structures. We show that the message passing module can be formulated as the inference process of a conditional random field (CRF) and implemented by differentiable operations, allowing the entire model to be trained in an end-to-end manner. By considering various combinations of the local structures, our tracker is able to form various types of structure patterns. Target tracking is finally achieved by a matching procedure of the structure patterns between target template and candidates. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed tracking algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods while running at a highly efficient speed of 45 fps.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yunhua_Zhang_Structured_Siamese_Network_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yunhua Zhang, Lijun Wang, Jinqing Qi, Dong Wang, Mengyang Feng, Huchuan Lu
A Zero-Shot Framework for Sketch based Image Retrieval	"Sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) is the task of retrieving images from a natural image database that correspond to a given hand-drawn sketch. Ideally, an SBIR model should learn to associate components in the sketch (say, feet, tail, etc.) with the corresponding components in the image. However, current evaluation methods simply focus only on coarse-grained evaluation where the focus is on retrieving images which belong to the same class as the sketch but not necessarily having the same components as in the sketch. As a result, existing methods simply learn to associate sketches with classes seen during training and hence fail to generalize to unseen classes. In this paper, we propose a new bench mark for zero-shot SBIR where the model is evaluated on novel classes that are not seen during training. We show through extensive experiments that existing models for SBIR which are trained in a discriminative setting learn only class specific mappings and fail to generalize to the proposed zero-shot setting. To circumvent this, we propose a generative approach for the SBIR task by proposing deep conditional generative models which take the sketch as an input and fill the missing information stochastically. Experiments on this new benchmark created from the ""Sketchy"" dataset, which is a large-scale database of sketch-photo pairs demonstrate that the performance of these generative models is significantly better than several state-of-the-art approaches in the proposed zero-shot framework of the coarse-grained SBIR task."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Sasikiran_Yelamarthi_A_Zero-Shot_Framework_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Sasi Kiran Yelamarthi, Shiva Krishna Reddy, Ashish Mishra, Anurag Mittal
Direct Sparse Odometry With Rolling Shutter	Neglecting the effects of rolling-shutter cameras for visual odometry (VO) severely degrades accuracy and robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel direct monocular VO method that incorporates a rolling-shutter model. Our approach extends direct sparse odometry which performs direct bundle adjustment of a set of recent keyframe poses and the depths of a sparse set of image points. We estimate the velocity at each keyframe and impose a constant-velocity prior for the optimization. In this way, we obtain a near real-time, accurate direct VO method. Our approach achieves improved results on challenging rolling-shutter sequences over state-of-the-art global-shutter VO.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/David_Schubert_Direct_Sparse_Odometry_ECCV_2018_paper.php	David Schubert, Nikolaus Demmel, Vladyslav Usenko, Jorg Stuckler, Daniel Cremers
Learning to Solve Nonlinear Least Squares for Monocular Stereo	Sum-of-squares objective functions are very popular in computer vision algorithms. However, these objective functions are not always easy to optimize. The underlying assumptions made by solvers are often not satisfied and many problems are inherently ill-posed. In this paper, we propose a neural nonlinear least squares optimization algorithm which learns to effectively optimize these cost functions even in the presence of adversities. Unlike traditional approaches, the proposed solver requires no hand-crafted regularizers or priors as these are implicitly learned from the data. We apply our method to the problem of motion stereo ie. jointly estimating the motion and scene geometry from pairs of images of a monocular sequence. We show that our learned optimizer is able to efficiently and effectively solve this challenging optimization problem.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ronald_Clark_Neural_Nonlinear_least_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ronald Clark, Michael Bloesch, Jan Czarnowski, Stefan Leutenegger, Andrew J.

Robust image stitching with multiple registrations	Panorama creation is one of the most widely deployed techniques in computer vision. In addition to industry applications such as Google Street View, it is also used by millions of consumers in smartphones and other cameras. Traditionally, the problem is decomposed into three phases: registration, which picks a single transformation of each source image to align it to the other inputs, seam finding, which selects a source image for each pixel in the final result, and blending, which fixes minor visual artifacts. Here, we observe that the use of a single registration often leads to errors, especially in scenes with significant depth variation or object motion. We propose instead the use of multiple registrations, permitting regions of the image at different depths to be captured with greater accuracy. MRF inference techniques naturally extend to seam finding over multiple registrations, and we show here that their energy functions can be readily modified with new terms that discourage duplication and tearing, common problems that are exacerbated by the use of multiple registrations. Our techniques are closely related to layer-based stereo, and move image stitching closer to explicit scene modeling. Experimental evidence demonstrates that our techniques often generate significantly better panoramas when there is substantial motion or parallax.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Charles_Herrmann_Robust_image_stitching_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Charles Herrmann, Chen Wang, Richard Strong Bowen, Emil Keyder, Michael Krainin, Ce Liu, Ramin Zabih
PersonLab: Person Pose Estimation and Instance Segmentation with a Bottom-Up, Part-Based, Geometric Embedding Model	We present a box-free bottom-up approach for the tasks of pose estimation and instance segmentation of people in multi-person images using an efficient single-shot model. The proposed PersonLab model tackles both semantic-level reasoning and object-part associations using part-based modeling. Our model employs a convolutional network which learns to detect individual keypoints and predict their relative displacements, allowing us to group keypoints into person pose instances. Further, we propose a part-induced geometric embedding descriptor which allows us to associate semantic person pixels with their corresponding person instance, delivering instance-level person segmentations. Our system is based on a fully-convolutional architecture and allows for efficient inference, with runtime essentially independent of the number of people present in the scene. Trained on COCO data alone, our system achieves COCO test-dev keypoint average precision of 0.665 using single-scale inference and 0.687 using multi-scale inference, significantly outperforming all previous bottom-up pose estimation systems. We are also the first bottom-up method to report competitive results for the person class in the COCO instance segmentation task, achieving a person category average precision of 0.417.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/George_Papandreou_PersonLab_Person_Pose_ECCV_2018_paper.php	George Papandreou, Tyler Zhu, Liang-Chieh Chen, Spyros Gidaris, Jonathan Tompson, Kevin Murphy
Deep Video Generation, Prediction and Completion of Human Action Sequences	Current video generation/prediction/completion results are limited, due to the severe ill-posedness inherent in these three problems. In this paper, we focus on human action videos, and propose a general, two-stage deep framework to generate human action videos with no constraints or arbitrary number of constraints, which uniformly address the three problems: video generation given no input frames, video prediction given the first few frames, and video completion given the first and last frames. To solve video generation from scratch, we build a two-stage framework where we first train a deep generative model that generates human pose sequences from random noise, and then train a skeleton-to-image network to synthesize human action videos given the human pose sequences generated. To solve video prediction and completion, we exploit our trained model and conduct optimization over the latent space to generate videos that best suit the given input frame constraints. With our novel method, we sidestep the original ill-posed problems and produce for the first time high-quality video generation/prediction/completion results of much longer duration. We present quantitative and qualitative evaluations to show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all three tasks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chunyan_Bai_Deep_Video_Generation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Haoye Cai, Chunyan Bai, Yu-Wing Tai, Chi-Keung Tang
Variable Ring Light Imaging: Capturing Transient Subsurface Scattering with An Ordinary Camera	Subsurface scattering plays a significant role in determining the appearance of real-world surfaces. A light ray penetrating into the subsurface is repeatedly scattered and absorbed by particles along its path before reemerging from the outer interface, which determines its spectral radiance. We introduce a novel imaging method that enables the decomposition of the appearance of a fronto-parallel real-world surface into images of light with bounded path lengths, i.e., transient subsurface light transport. Our key idea is to observe each surface point under a variable ring light: a circular illumination pattern of increasingly larger radius centered on it. We show that the path length of light captured in each of these observations is naturally lower-bounded by the ring light radius. By taking the difference of ring light images of incrementally larger radii, we compute transient images that encode light with bounded path lengths. Experimental results on synthetic and complex real-world surfaces demonstrate that the recovered transient images reveal the subsurface structure of general translucent inhomogeneous surfaces. We further show that their differences reveal the surface colors at different surface depths. The proposed method is the first to enable the unveiling of dense and continuous subsurface structures from steady-state external appearance using ordinary camera and illumination.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ko_Nishino_Variable_Ring_Light_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ko Nishino, Art Subpa-asa, Yuta Asano, Mihoko Shimano, Imari Sato
Learning to Capture Light Fields through a Coded Aperture Camera	We propose a learning-based framework for acquiring a light field through a coded aperture camera. Acquiring a light field is a challenging task due to the amount of data. To make the acquisition process efficient, coded aperture cameras were successfully adopted; using these cameras, a light field is computationally reconstructed from several images that are acquired with different aperture patterns. However, it is still difficult to reconstruct a high-quality light field from only a few acquired images. To tackle this limitation, we formulated the entire pipeline of light field acquisition from the perspective of an auto-encoder. This auto-encoder was implemented as a stack of fully convolutional layers and was trained end-to-end by using a collection of training samples. We experimentally show that our method can successfully learn good image-acquisition and reconstruction strategies. With our method, light fields consisting of 5 x 5 or 8 x 8 images can be successfully reconstructed only from a few acquired images. Moreover, our method achieved superior performance over several state-of-the-art methods. We also applied our method to a real prototype camera to show that it is capable of capturing a real 3-D scene.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yasutaka_Inagaki_Learning_to_Capture_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yasutaka Inagaki, Yuto Kobayashi, Keita Takahashi, Toshiaki Fujii, Hajime Nagahara
Rolling Shutter Pose and Ego-motion Estimation using Shape-from-Template	We propose a new method for the absolute camera pose problem (PnP) which handles Rolling Shutter (RS) effects. Unlike all existing methods which perform 3D-2D registration after augmenting the Global Shutter (GS) projection model with the velocity parameters under various kinematic models, we propose to use local differential constraints. These are established by drawing an analogy with Shape-from-Template (SfT). The main idea consists in considering that RS distortions due to camera ego-motion during image acquisition can be interpreted as virtual deformations of a template captured by a GS camera. Once the virtual deformations have been recovered using SfT, the camera pose and ego-motion are computed by registering the deformed scene on the original template. This 3D-3D registration involves a 3D cost function based on the Euclidean point distance, more physically meaningful than the re-projection error or the algebraic distance based cost functions used in previous work. Results on both synthetic and real data show that the proposed method outperforms existing RS pose estimation techniques in terms of accuracy and stability of performance in various configurations.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yizhen_Lao_Rolling_Shutter_Pose_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yizhen Lao, Omar Ait-Aider, Adrien Bartoli
Relaxation-Free Deep Hashing via Policy Gradient	In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective relaxation-free method to learn more effective binary codes via policy gradient for scalable image search. While a variety of deep hashing methods have been proposed in recent years, most of them are confronted by the dilemma to obtain optimal binary codes in a truly end-to-end manner with non-smooth sign activations. Unlike existing methods which usually employ a general relaxation framework to adapt to the gradient-based algorithms, our approach formulates the non-smooth part of the hashing network as sampling with a stochastic policy, so that the retrieval performance degradation caused by the relaxation can be avoided. Specifically, our method directly generates the binary codes and maximizes the expectation of rewards for similarity preservation, where the network can be trained directly via policy gradient. Hence, the differentiation challenge for discrete optimization can be naturally addressed, which leads to effective gradients and binary codes. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xin_Yuan_Towards_Optimal_Deep_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xin Yuan, Liangliang Ren, Jiwen Lu, Jie Zhou

W-TALC: Weakly-supervised Temporal Activity Localization and Classification	Most activity localization methods in the literature suffer from the burden of frame-wise annotation requirement. Learning from weak labels may be a potential solution towards reducing such manual labeling effort. Recent years have witnessed a substantial influx of tagged videos on the Internet, which can serve as a rich source of weakly-supervised training data. Specifically, the correlations between videos with similar tags can be utilized to temporally localize the activities. Towards this goal, we present W-TALC, a Weakly-supervised Temporal Activity Localization and Classification framework using only video-level labels. The proposed network can be divided into two sub-networks, namely the Two-Stream based feature extractor network and a weakly-supervised module, which we learn by optimizing two complimentary loss functions. Qualitative and quantitative results on two challenging datasets - Thumos14 and ActivityNet1.2, demonstrate that the proposed method is able to detect activities at a fine granularity and achieve better performance than current state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Sujoy_Paul_W-TALC_Weakly-supervised_Temporal_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Sujoy Paul, Sourya Roy, Amit K.

Learning to Detect and Track Visible and Occluded Body Joints in a Virtual World	Multi-People Tracking in an open-world setting requires a special effort in precise detection. Moreover, temporal continuity in the detection phase gains more importance when scene cluttering introduces the challenging problems of occluded targets. For the purpose, we propose a deep network architecture that jointly extracts people body parts and associates them across short temporal spans. Our model explicitly deals with occluded body parts, by hallucinating plausible solutions of not visible joints. We propose a new end-to-end architecture composed by four branches (visible heatmaps, occluded heatmaps, part affinity fields and temporal affinity fields) fed by a time linker feature extractor. To overcome the lack of surveillance data with tracking, body part and occlusion annotations we created the vastest Computer Graphics dataset for people tracking in urban scenarios by exploiting a photorealistic videogame. It is up to now the vastest dataset (about 500.000 frames, almost 10 million body poses) of human body parts for people tracking in urban scenarios. Our architecture trained on virtual data exhibits good generalization capabilities also on public real tracking benchmarks, when image resolution and sharpness are high enough, producing reliable tracklets useful for further batch data association or re-id modules.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Matteo_Fabbri_Learning_to_Detect_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Matteo Fabbri, Fabio Lanzi, Simone Calderara, Andrea Palazzi, Roberto Vezzani, Rita Cucchiara
Generalized Loss-Sensitive Adversarial Learning with Manifold Margins	The classic Generative Adversarial Net and its variants can be roughly categorized into two large families: the unregularized ver- sus regularized GANs. By relaxing the non-parametric assumption on the discriminator in the classic GAN, the regularized GANs have better generalization ability to produce new samples drawn from the real dis- tribution. It is well known that the real data like natural images are not uniformly distributed over the whole data space. Instead, they are often restricted to a low-dimensional manifold of the ambient space. Such a manifold assumption suggests the distance over the manifold should be a better measure to characterize the distinct between real and fake sam- ples. Thus, we define a pullback operator to map samples back to their data manifold, and a manifold margin is defined as the distance between the pullback representations to distinguish between real and fake sam- ples and learn the optimal generators. We justify the effectiveness of the proposed model both theoretically and empirically.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Marzieh_Edraki_Generalized_Loss-Sensitive_Adversarial_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Marzieh Edraki, Guo-Jun Qi
Large Scale Urban Scene Modeling from MVS Meshes	In this paper we present an effcient modeling framework for large scale urban scenes. Taking surface meshes derived from multi- view-stereo systems as input, our algorithm outputs simplied models with semantics at different levels of detail (LODs). Our key observation is that urban building is usually composed of planar roof tops connected with vertical walls. There are two major steps in our framework: segmentation and building modeling. The scene is first segmented into four classes with a Markov random field combining height and image features. In the following modeling step, various 2D line segments sketching the roof boundaries are detected and slice the plane into faces. Through assigning each face with a roof plane, the final model is constructed by extruding the faces to the corresponding planes. By combining geometric and appearance cues together, the proposed method is robust and fast compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Lingjie_Zhu_Large_Scale_Urban_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Lingjie Zhu, Shuhan Shen, Xiang Gao, Zhanyi Hu
Encoder-Decoder with Atrous Separable Convolution for Semantic Image Segmentation	Spatial pyramid pooling module or encode-decoder structure are used in deep neural networks for semantic segmentation task. The former networks are able to encode multi-scale contextual information by probing the incoming features with filters or pooling operations at multiple rates and multiple effective fields-of-view, while the latter networks can capture sharper object boundaries by gradually recovering the spatial information. In this work, we propose to combine the advantages from both methods. Specifically, our proposed model, DeepLabv3+, extends DeepLabv3 by adding a simple yet effective decoder module to refine the segmentation results especially along object boundaries. We further explore the Xception model and apply the depthwise separable convolution to both Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling and decoder modules, resulting in a faster and stronger encoder-decoder network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, achieving the test set performance of 89% and 82.1% without any post-processing.

CPlaNet: Enhancing Image Geolocalization by Combinatorial Partitioning of Maps	Image geolocalization is the task of identifying the location depicted in a photo based only on its visual information. This task is inherently challenging since many photos have only few, possibly ambiguous cues to their geolocation. Recent work has cast this task as a classification problem by partitioning the earth into a set of discrete cells that correspond to geographic regions. The granularity of this partitioning presents a critical trade-off; using fewer but larger cells results in lower location accuracy while using more but smaller cells reduces the number of training examples per class and increases model size, making the model prone to overfitting. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple but effective algorithm, combinatorial partitioning, which generates a large number of fine-grained output classes by intersecting multiple coarse-grained partitionings of the earth. Each classifier votes for the fine-grained classes that overlap with their respective coarse-grained ones. This technique allows us to predict locations at a fine scale while maintaining sufficient training examples per class. Our algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance in location recognition on multiple benchmark datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Paul_Hongsuck_Seo_Enhancing_Image_Geolocalization_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Paul Hongsuck Seo, Tobias Weyand, Jack Sim, Bohyung Han
Image Inpainting for Irregular Holes Using Partial Convolutions	Existing deep learning based image inpainting methods use a standard convolutional network over the corrupted image, using convolutional filter responses conditioned on both valid pixels as well as the substitute values in the masked holes (typically the mean value). This often leads to artifacts such as color discrepancy and blurriness. Post-processing is usually used to reduce such artifacts, but are expensive and may fail. We propose to use partial convolutions, where the convolution is masked and renormalized to be conditioned on only valid pixels. We further include a mechanism to automatically generate an updated mask for the next layer as part of the forward pass. Our model outperforms other methods for irregular masks. We show qualitative and quantitative comparisons with other inpainting methods to validate our approach.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Guilin_Liu_Image_Inpainting_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Guilin Liu, Fitsum A.

Joint & Progressive Learning from High-Dimensional Data for Multi-Label Classification	Despite the fact that nonlinear subspace learning techniques (e.g. manifold learning) have successfully applied to data representation, there is still room for improvement in explainability (explicit mapping), generalization (out-of-samples), and cost-effectiveness (linearization). To this end, a novel linearized subspace learning technique is developed in a joint and progressive way, called joint and progressive learning strategy (J-Play), with its application to multi-label classification. The J-Play learns high-level and semantically meaningful feature representation from high-dimensional data by 1) jointly performing multiple subspace learning and classification to find a latent subspace where samples are expected to be better classified; 2) progressively learning multi-coupled projections to linearly approach the optimal mapping bridging the original space with the most discriminative subspace; 3) locally embedding manifold structure in each learnable latent subspace. Extensive experiments are performed to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with previous state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Danfeng_Hong_Joint__Progressive_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Danfeng Hong, Naoto Yokoya, Jian Xu, Xiaoxiang Zhu
Dividing and Aggregating Network for Multi-view Action Recognition	In this paper, we propose a new Dividing and Aggregating Network (DA-Net) for multi-view action recognition. In our DA-Net, we learn view-independent representations shared by all views at lower layers, while we learn one view-specific representation for each view at higher layers. We then train view-specific action classifiers based on the view-specific representation for each view and a view classifier based on the shared representation at lower layers. The view classifier is used to predict how likely each video belongs to each view. Finally, the predicted view probabilities from multiple views are used as the weights when fusing the prediction scores of view-specific action classifiers. We also propose a new approach based on the conditional random field (CRF) formulation to pass message among view-specific representations from different branches to help each other. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DA-Net for multi-view action recognition.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Dongang_Wang_Dividing_and_Aggregating_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Dongang Wang, Wanli Ouyang, Wen Li, Dong Xu
Learning to Fuse Proposals from Multiple Scanline Optimizations in Semi-Global Matching	Semi-Global Matching (SGM) uses an aggregation scheme to combine costs from multiple 1D scanline optimizations that tends to hurt its accuracy in difficult scenarios. We propose replacing this aggregation scheme with a new learning-based method that fuses disparity proposals estimated using scanline optimization. Our proposed SGM-Forest algorithm solves this problem using per-pixel classification. SGM-Forest currently ranks 1st on the ETH3D stereo benchmark and is ranked competitively on the Middlebury 2014 and KITTI 2015 benchmarks. It consistently outperforms SGM in challenging settings and under difficult training protocols that demonstrate robust generalization, while adding only a small computational overhead to SGM.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Johannes_Schoenberger_Learning_to_Fuse_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Johannes L.

Learning Type-Aware Embeddings for Fashion Compatibility	Outfits in online fashion data are composed of items of many different types (e.g. top, bottom, shoes) that share some stylistic relationship with one another. A representation for building outfits requires a method that can learn both notions of similarity (for example, when two tops are interchangeable) and compatibility (items of possibly different type that can go together in an outfit). This paper presents an approach to learning an image embedding that respects item type, and jointly learns notions of item similarity and compatibility in an end-to-end model. To evaluate the learned representation, we crawled 68,306 outfits created by users on the Polyvore website. Our approach obtains 3-5% improvement over the state-of-the-art on outfit compatibility prediction and fill-in-the-blank tasks using our dataset, as well as an established smaller dataset, while supporting a variety of useful queries.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Mariya_Vasileva_Learning_Type-Aware_Embeddings_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Mariya I.

Burst Image Deblurring Using Permutation Invariant Convolutional Neural Networks	We propose a neural approach for fusing an arbitrary-length burst of photographs suffering from severe camera shake and noise into a sharp and noise-free image. Our novel convolutional architecture has a simultaneous view of all frames in the burst, and by construction treats them in an order-independent manner. This enables it to effectively detect and leverage subtle cues scattered across different frames, while ensuring that each frame gets a full and equal consideration regardless of its position in the sequence. We train the network with richly varied synthetic data consisting of camera shake, realistic noise, and other common imaging defects. The method demonstrates consistent state of the art burst image restoration performance for highly degraded sequences of real-world images, and extracts accurate detail that is not discernible from any of the individual frames in isolation.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Miika_Aittala_Burst_Image_Deblurring_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Miika Aittala, Fredo Durand
Dynamic Conditional Networks for Few-Shot Learning	This paper proposes a novel Dynamic Conditional Convolutional Network (DCCN) to handle conditional few-shot learning, i.e, only a few training samples are available for each condition. DCCN consists of dual subnets: DyConvNet contains a dynamic convolutional layer with a bank of basis filters; CondiNet predicts a set of adaptive weights from conditional inputs to linearly combine the basis filters. In this manner, a specific convolutional kernel can be dynamically obtained for each conditional input. The filter bank is shared between all conditions thus only a low-dimension weight vector needs to be learned. This significantly facilitates the parameter learning across different conditions when training data are limited. We evaluate DCCN on four tasks which can be formulated as conditional model learning, including specific object counting, multi-modal image classification, phrase grounding and identity based face generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in the conditional few-shot learning setting.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Fang_Zhao_Dynamic_Conditional_Networks_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Fang Zhao, Jian Zhao, Shuicheng Yan, Jiashi Feng
Key-Word-Aware Network for Referring Expression Image Segmentation	Referring expression image segmentation aims to segment out the object referred by a natural language query expression. Without considering the specific properties of visual and textual information, existing works usually deal with this task by directly feeding a foreground/background classifier with cascaded image and text features, which are extracted from each image region and the whole query, respectively. On the one hand, they ignore that each word in a query expression makes different contributions to identify the desired object, which requires a differential treatment in extracting text feature. On the other hand, the relationships of different image regions are not considered as well, even though they are greatly important to eliminate the undesired foreground object in accordance with specific query. To address aforementioned issues, in this paper, we propose a key-word-aware network, which contains a query attention model and a key-word-aware visual context model. In extracting text features, the query attention model attends to assign higher weights for the words which are more important for identifying object. Meanwhile, the key-word-aware visual context model describes the relationships among different image regions, according to corresponding query. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two referring expression image segmentation databases.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hengcan_Shi_Key-Word-Aware_Network_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hengcan Shi, Hongliang Li, Fanman Meng, Qingbo Wu
A Minimal Closed-Form Solution for Multi-Perspective Pose Estimation using Points and Lines	We propose a minimal solution for pose estimation using both points and lines for a multi-perspective camera. In this paper, we treat the multi-perspective camera as a collection of rigidly attached perspective cameras. These type of imaging devices are useful for several computer vision applications that require a large coverage such as surveillance, self-driving cars, and motion-capture studios. While prior methods have considered the cases using solely points or lines, the hybrid case involving both points and lines has not been solved for multi-perspective cameras. We present the solutions for two cases. In the first case, we are given 2D to 3D correspondences for two points and one line. In the later case, we are given 2D to 3D correspondences for one point and two lines. We show that the solution for the case of two points and one line can be formulated as a fourth degree equation. This is interesting because we can get a closed-form solution and thereby achieve high computational efficiency. The later case involving two lines and one point can be mapped to an eighth degree equation. We show simulations and real experiments to demonstrate the advantages and benefits over existing methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Pedro_Miraldo_A_Minimal_Closed-Form_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Pedro Miraldo, Tiago Dias, Srikumar Ramalingam
Hierarchical Metric Learning and Matching for 2D and 3D Geometric Correspondences	Interest point descriptors have fueled progress on almost every problem in computer vision. Recent advances in deep neural networks have enabled task-specific learned descriptors that outperform hand-crafted descriptors on many problems. We demonstrate that commonly used metric learning approaches do not optimally leverage the feature hierarchies learned in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), especially when applied to the task of geometric feature matching. While a metric loss applied to the deepest layer of a CNN, is often expected to yield ideal features irrespective of the task, in fact the growing receptive field as well as striding effects cause shallower features to be better at high precision matching tasks. We leverage this insight together with explicit supervision at multiple levels of the feature hierarchy for better regularization, to learn more effective descriptors in the context of geometric matching tasks. Further, we propose to use activation maps at different layers of a CNN, as an effective and principled replacement for the multi-resolution image pyramids often used for matching tasks. We propose concrete CNN architectures employing these ideas, and evaluate them on multiple datasets for 2D and 3D geometric matching as well as optical flow, demonstrating state-of-the-art results and generalization across datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Mohammed_Fathy_Hierarchical_Metric_Learning_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Mohammed E.

Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation with Stacked Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks	Recent studies on unsupervised image-to-image translation have made remarkable progress by training a pair of generative adversarial networks with a cycle-consistent loss. However, such unsupervised methods may generate inferior results when the image resolution is high or the two image domains are of significant appearance differences, such as the translations between semantic layouts and natural images in the Cityscapes dataset. In this paper, we propose novel Stacked Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (SCANs) by decomposing a single translation into multi-stage transformations, which not only boost the image translation quality but also enable higher resolution image-toimage translation in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Moreover, to properly exploit the information from the previous stage, an adaptive fusion block is devised to learn a dynamic integration of the current stage's output and the previous stage's output. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach can improve the translation quality compared with previous single-stage unsupervised methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Minjun_Li_Unsupervised_Image-to-Image_Translation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Minjun Li, Haozhi Huang, Lin Ma, Wei Liu, Tong Zhang, Yugang Jiang
Learning Shape Priors for Single-View 3D Completion and Reconstruction	The problem of single-view 3D shape completion or reconstruction is challenging, because among the many possible shapes that explain an observation, most are implausible and do not correspond to natural objects. Recent research in the field has tackled this problem by exploiting the expressiveness of deep convolutional networks. In fact, there is another level of ambiguity that is often overlooked: there are usually multiple plausible shapes that fit the 2D image equally well; i.e., the ground truth shape is non-deterministic given the input. Existing fully supervised approaches fail to address this issue, and often produce blurry mean shapes with smooth surfaces but no fine details. In this paper, we propose ShapeHD, pushing the limit of single-view shape completion and reconstruction by integrating deep generative models with adversarially learned shape priors. The learned priors serve as a regularizer, penalizing the model only if its output is unrealistic, not if it deviates from the ground truth. Our design thus overcomes both types of ambiguities aforementioned. Experiments demonstrate that ShapeHD outperforms state-of-the-arts by a large margin on both shape completion and shape reconstruction.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jiajun_Wu_Learning_3D_Shape_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jiajun Wu, Chengkai Zhang, Xiuming Zhang, Zhoutong Zhang, William T.

Two at Once: Enhancing Learning and Generalization Capacities via IBN-Net	Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great successes in many computer vision problems. Unlike existing works that designed CNN architectures to improve performance on a single task of a single domain and not generalizable, we present IBN-Net, a novel convolutional architecture, which remarkably enhances a CNN's modeling ability on one domain (e.g. Cityscapes) as well as its generalization capacity on another domain (e.g. GTA5) without finetuning. IBN-Net carefully integrates Instance Normalization (IN) and Batch Normalization (BN) as building blocks, and can be wrapped into many advanced deep networks to improve their performances. This work has three key contributions. (1) By delving into IN and BN, we disclose that IN learns features that are invariant to appearance changes, such as colors, styles, and virtuality/reality, while BN is essential for preserving content related information. (2) IBN-Net can be applied to many advanced deep architectures, such as DenseNet, ResNet, ResNeXt, and SENet, and consistently improve their performance without increasing computational cost. (3) When applying the trained networks to new domains, e.g. from GTA5 to Cityscapes, IBN-Net achieves comparable improvements as domain adaptation methods, even without using data from the target domain. With IBN-Net, we won the 1st place on the WAD 2018 Challenge Drivable Area track, with an mIoU of 86.18%.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xingang_Pan_Two_at_Once_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xingang Pan, Ping Luo, Jianping Shi, Xiaoou Tang
Recycle-GAN: Unsupervised Video Retargeting	We introduce a data-driven approach for unsupervised video retargeting that translates content from one domain to another while preserving the style native to a domain, i.e., if contents of John Oliver's speech were to be transferred to Stephen Colbert, then the generated content/speech should be in Stephen Colbert's style. Our approach combines both spatial and temporal information along with adversarial losses for content translation and style preservation. In this work, we first study the advantages of using spatiotemporal constraints over spatial constraints for effective retargeting. We then demonstrate the proposed approach for the problems where information in both space and time matters such as face-to-face translation, flower-to-flower, wind and cloud synthesis, sunrise and sunset.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Aayush_Bansal_Recycle-GAN_Unsupervised_Video_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Aayush Bansal, Shugao Ma, Deva Ramanan, Yaser Sheikh
Few-Shot Human Motion Prediction via Meta-Learning	Human motion prediction, forecasting human motion in a few milliseconds conditioning on a historical 3D skeleton sequence, is a long-standing problem in computer vision and robotic vision. Existing forecasting algorithms rely on extensive annotated motion capture data and are brittle to novel actions. This paper addresses the problem of few-shot human motion prediction, in the spirit of the recent progress on few-shot learning and meta-learning. More precisely, our approach is based on the insight that having a good generalization from few examples relies on both a generic initial model and an effective strategy for adapting this model to novel tasks. To accomplish this, we propose proactive and adaptive meta-learning (PAML) that introduces a novel combination of model-agnostic meta-learning and model regression networks and unifies them into an integrated, end-to-end framework. By doing so, our meta-learner produces a generic model initialization through aggregating contextual information from a variety of prediction tasks, while this model can effectively adapt to a specific task by leveraging learning-to-learn knowledge about how to transform few-shot model parameters to many-shot model parameters. The resulting PAML predictor model significantly improves the prediction performance on the heavily benchmarked H3.6M dataset in the small-sample size regime.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Liangyan_Gui_Few-Shot_Human_Motion_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Liang-Yan Gui, Yu-Xiong Wang, Deva Ramanan, Jose M.

Coded Two-Bucket Cameras for Computer Vision	"We introduce coded two-bucket (C2B) imaging, a new operating principle for computational sensors with applications in active 3D shape estimation and coded-exposure imaging. A C2B sensor modulates the light arriving at each pixel by controlling which of the pixel's two ""buckets"" should integrate it. C2B sensors output two images per video frame---one per bucket---and allow rapid, fully-programmable, per-pixel control of the active bucket. Using these properties as a starting point, we (1) develop an image formation model for these sensors, (2) couple them with programmable light sources to acquire illumination mosaics, i.e., images of a scene under many different illumination conditions whose pixels have been multiplexed onto the sensor plane and acquired in one shot, and (3) show how to process illumination mosaics to acquire time-varying depth or normal maps of dynamic scenes at the sensor's native resolution. We present the first experimental demonstration of these capabilities, using a fully functional C2B camera prototype. Key to this prototype is a C2B sensor that was designed by us, fabricated in a standard CMOS imaging technology, and demonstrated for the first time in this paper."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Mian_Wei_Coded_Two-Bucket_Cameras_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Mian Wei, Navid Sarhangnejad, Zhengfan Xia, Nikita Gusev, Nikola Katic, Roman Genov, Kiriakos N.

Deep Bilinear Learning for RGB-D Action Recognition	In this paper, we focus on exploring modality-temporal mutual information for RGB-D action recognition. In order to learn time-varying information and multi-modal features jointly, we propose a novel deep bilinear learning framework. In the framework, we propose bilinear blocks that consist of two linear pooling layers for pooling the input cube features from both modality and temporal directions, separately. To capture rich modality-temporal information and facilitate our deep bilinear learning, a new action feature called modality-temporal cube is presented in a tensor structure for characterizing RGB-D actions from a comprehensive perspective. Our method is extensively tested on two public datasets with four different evaluation settings, and the results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/HU_Jian-Fang_Deep_Bilinear_Learning_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jian-Fang Hu, Wei-Shi Zheng, Jiahui Pan, Jianhuang Lai, Jianguo Zhang
Characterizing Adversarial Examples Based on Spatial Consistency Information for Semantic Segmentation	Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in various recognition tasks. However, recently DNNs have been shown to be vulnerable against adversarial examples, which can mislead DNNs to make arbitrary incorrect predictions. While adversarial examples are mainly studied in classification, special properties may be inherited for those targeting on segmentation models which require additional components such as dilated convolutions and multiscale processing. In this paper, we aim to characterize adversarial examples based on spatial context information in segmentation. We observe that spatial consistency information can be potentially leveraged to recognize/detect adversarial examples robustly even when facing adaptive attacker who has access to the model and detection strategies. We also show that adversarial examples based on attacks we considered barely transfer among models, even though transferability is common in classification. Our observations shed new light on developing adversarial attacks and defenses to better understand the vulnerabilities of DNNs.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/CHAOWEI_XIAO_Characterize_Adversarial_Examples_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chaowei Xiao, Ruizhi Deng, Bo Li, Fisher Yu, Mingyan Liu, Dawn Song
Learning to Reconstruct High-quality 3D Shapes with Cascaded Fully Convolutional Networks	We present a data-driven approach to reconstructing high-resolution and detailed volumetric representations of 3D shapes. Although well studied, algorithms for volumetric fusion from multi-view depth scans are still prone to scanning noise and occlusions, making it hard to obtain high-fidelity 3D reconstructions. In this paper, inspired by recent advances in efficient 3D deep learning techniques, we introduce a novel cascaded 3D convolutional network architecture, which learns to reconstruct implicit surface representations from noisy and incomplete depth maps in a progressive, coarse-to-fine manner. To this end, we also develop an algorithm for end-to-end training of the proposed cascaded structure. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art work in terms of quality and fidelity of reconstructed models.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yan-Pei_Cao_Learning_to_Reconstruct_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yan-Pei Cao, Zheng-Ning Liu, Zheng-Fei Kuang, Leif Kobbelt, Shi-Min Hu
Spatio-Temporal Channel Correlation Networks for Action Classification	The work in this paper is driven by the question if spatio-temporal correlations are enough for 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN)? Most of the traditional 3D networks use local spatio-temporal features. We introduce a new block that models correlations between channels of a 3D CNN with respect to temporal and spatial features. This new block can be added as a residual unit to different parts of 3D CNNs. We name our novel block 'Spatio-Temporal Channel Correlation' (STC). By embedding this block to the current state-of-the-art architectures such as ResNext and ResNet, we improve the performance by 2-3% on the Kinetics dataset. Our experiments show that adding STC blocks to current state-of-the-art architectures outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the HMDB51, UCF101 and Kinetics datasets. The other issue in training 3D CNNs is about training them from scratch with a huge labeled dataset to get a reasonable performance. So the knowledge learned in 2D CNNs is completely ignored. Another contribution in this work is a simple and effective technique to transfer knowledge from a pre-trained 2D CNN to a randomly initialized 3D CNN for a stable weight initialization. This allows us to significantly reduce the number of training samples for 3D CNNs. Thus, by fine-tuning this network, we beat the performance of generic and recent methods in 3D CNNs, which were trained on large video datasets, e.g. Sports-1M, and fine-tuned on the target datasets, e.g. HMDB51/UCF101.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ali_Diba_Spatio-Temporal_Channel_Correlation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ali Diba, Mohsen Fayyaz, Vivek Sharma, M.

A Unified Framework for Multi-View Multi-Class Object Pose Estimation	One core challenge in object pose estimation is to ensure accurate and robust performance for large numbers of diverse foreground objects amidst complex background clutter. In this work, we present a scalable framework for accurately inferring six Degree-of-Freedom (6-DoF) pose for a large number of object classes from single or multiple views. To learn discriminative pose features, we integrate three new capabilities into a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): an inference scheme that combines both classification and pose regression based on a uniform tessellation of the Special Euclidean group in three dimensions (SE(3)), the fusion of class priors into the training process via a tiled class map, and an additional regularization using deep supervision with an object mask. Further, an efficient multi-view framework is formulated to address single-view ambiguity. We show that this framework consistently improves the performance of the single-view network. We evaluate our method on three large-scale benchmarks: YCB-Video, JHUScene-50 and ObjectNet-3D. Our approach achieves competitive or superior performance over the current state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chi_Li_A_Unified_Framework_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chi Li, Jin Bai, Gregory D.

ExplainGAN: Model Explanation via Decision Boundary Crossing Transformations	We introduce a new method for interpreting computer vision models: visually perceptible, decision-boundary crossing transformations. Our goal is to answer a simple question: why did a model classify an image as being of class A instead of class B? Existing approaches to model interpretation, including saliency and explanation-by-nearest neighbor, fail to visually illustrate examples of transformations required for a specific input to alter a model's prediction. On the other hand, algorithms for creating decision-boundary crossing transformations (e.g., adversarial examples) produce differences that are visually imperceptible and do not enable insightful explanation. To address this we introduce ExplainGAN, a generative model that produces visually perceptible decision-boundary crossing transformations. These transformations provide high-level conceptual insights which illustrate how a model makes decisions. We validate our model using both traditional quantitative interpretation metrics and introduce a new validation scheme for our approach and generative models more generally.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Nathan_Silberman_ExplainGAN_Model_Explanation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Pouya Samangouei, Ardavan Saeedi, Liam Nakagawa, Nathan Silberman
Descending, lifting or smoothing: Secrets of robust cost optimization	Robust cost optimization is the challenging task of fitting a large number of parameters to data points containing a significant and unknown fraction of outliers. In this work we identify three classes of deterministic second-order algorithms that are able to tackle this type of optimization problem: direct approaches that aim to optimize the robust cost directly with a second order method, lifting-based approaches that add so called lifting variables to embed the given robust cost function into a higher dimensional space, and graduated optimization methods that solve a sequence of smoothed cost functions. We study each of these classes of algorithms and propose improvements either to reduce their computational time or to make them find better local minima. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the superiority of our improved graduated optimization method over the state of the art algorithms both on synthetic and real data for four different problems.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Christopher_Zach_Descending_lifting_or_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Christopher Zach, Guillaume Bourmaud
Face Super-resolution Guided by Facial Component Heatmaps	State-of-the-art face super-resolution methods use deep convolutional neural networks to learn a mapping between low-resolution (LR) facial patterns and their corresponding high-resolution (HR) counterparts by exploring local information. However, most of them do not account for face structure and suffer from degradations due to large pose variations and misalignments of faces. Our method incorporates structural information of faces explicitly into face super-resolution by using a multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN). Our CNN has two branches: one for super-resolving face images and the other branch for predicting salient regions of a face coined facial component heatmaps. These heatmaps guide the up-sampling stream for generating better super-resolved faces with high-quality details. Our method uses not only the low-level information (ie intensity similarity), but also middle-level information (ie face structure) to further explore spatial constraints of facial components from LR inputs images. Therefore, we are able to super-resolve very small unaligned face images (16$ imes$16 pixels) with a large upscaling factor of 8$ imes$ while preserving face structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network achieves superior face hallucination results and outperforms the state-of-the-art.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xin_Yu_Face_Super-resolution_Guided_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xin Yu, Basura Fernando, Bernard Ghanem, Fatih Porikli, Richard Hartley
Unified Perceptual Parsing for Scene Understanding	Humans recognize the visual world at multiple levels: we effortlessly categorize scenes and detect objects inside, while also identifying the textures and surfaces of the objects along with their different compositional parts. In this paper, we study a new task called Unified Perceptual Parsing, which requires the machine vision systems to recognize as many visual concepts as possible from a given image. A multi-task framework called UPerNet and a training strategy are developed to learn from heterogeneous image annotations. We benchmark our framework on Unified Perceptual Parsing and show that it is able to effectively segment a wide range of concepts from images. The trained networks are further applied to discover visual knowledge in natural scenes.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tete_Xiao_Unified_Perceptual_Parsing_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tete Xiao, Yingcheng Liu, Bolei Zhou, Yuning Jiang, Jian Sun
Learning Data Terms for Non-blind Deblurring	Existing deblurring methods mainly focus on developing effective image priors and assume that blurred images contain insignificant amounts of noise. However, state-of-the-art deblurring methods do not perform well on real-world images degraded with significant noise or outliers. To address these issues, we show that it is critical to learn data fitting terms beyond the commonly used L1 or L2 norm. We propose a simple and effective discriminative framework to learn data terms that can adaptively handle blurred images in the presence of severe noise and outliers. Instead of learning the distribution of the data fitting errors, we directly learn the associated shrinkage function for the data term using a cascaded architecture, which is more flexible and efficient. Our analysis shows that the shrinkage functions learned at the intermediate stages can effectively suppress noise and preserve image structures. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jiangxin_Dong_Learning_Data_Terms_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jiangxin Dong, Jinshan Pan, Deqing Sun, Zhixun Su, Ming-Hsuan Yang
Bi-box Regression for Pedestrian Detection and Occlusion Estimation	Occlusions present a great challenge for pedestrian detection in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to simultaneous pedestrian detection and occlusion estimation by regressing two bounding boxes to localize the full body as well as the visible part of a pedestrian respectively. For this purpose, we learn a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) consisting of two branches, one for full body estimation and the other for visible part estimation. The two branches are treated differently during training such that they are learned to produce complementary outputs which can be further fused to improve detection performance. The full body estimation branch is trained to regress full body regions for positive pedestrian proposals, while the visible part estimation branch is trained to regress visible part regions for both positive and negative pedestrian proposals. The visible part region of a negative pedestrian proposal is forced to shrink to its center. In addition, we introduce a new criterion for selecting positive training examples, which contributes largely to heavily occluded pedestrian detection. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed bi-box regression approach on the Caltech and CityPersons datasets. Experimental results show that our approach achieves promising performance for detecting both non-occluded and occluded pedestrians, especially heavily occluded ones.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/CHUNLUAN_ZHOU_Bi-box_Regression_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chunluan Zhou, Junsong Yuan
Semi-convolutional Operators for Instance Segmentation	Object detection and instance segmentation are dominated by region-based methods such as Mask RCNN. However, there is a growing interest in reducing these problems to pixel labeling tasks, as the latter could be more efficient, could be integrated seamlessly in image-to-image network architectures as used in many other tasks, and could be more accurate for objects that are not well approximated by bounding boxes. In this paper we show theoretically and empirically that constructing dense pixel embeddings that can separate object instances cannot be easily achieved using convolutional operators. At the same time, we show that simple modifications, which we call semi-convolutional, have a much better chance of succeeding at this task. We use the latter to show a connection to Hough voting as well as to a variant of the bilateral kernel that is spatially steered by a convolutional network. We demonstrate that these operators can also be used to improve approaches such as Mask RCNN, demonstrating better segmentation of complex biological shapes and PASCAL VOC categories than achievable by Mask RCNN alone.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Samuel_Albanie_Semi-convolutional_Operators_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	David Novotny, Samuel Albanie, Diane Larlus, Andrea Vedaldi
From Face Recognition to Models of Identity: A Bayesian Approach to Learning about Unknown Identities from Unsupervised Data	Current face recognition systems robustly recognize identities across a wide variety of imaging conditions. In these systems recognition is performed via classification into known identities obtained from supervised identity annotations. There are two problems with this current paradigm: (1) current systems are unable to benefit from unlabelled data which may be available in large quantities; and (2) current systems equate successful recognition with labelling a given input image. Humans, on the other hand, regularly perform identification of individuals completely unsupervised, recognising the identity of someone they have seen before even without being able to name that individual. How can we go beyond the current classification paradigm towards a more human understanding of identities? We propose an integrated Bayesian model that coherently reasons about the observed images, identities, partial knowledge about names, and the situational context of each observation. While our model achieves good recognition performance against known identities, it can also discover new identities from unsupervised data and learns to associate identities with different contexts depending on which identities tend to be observed together. In addition, the proposed semi-supervised component is able to handle not only acquaintances, whose names are known, but also unlabelled familiar faces and complete strangers in a unified framework.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Daniel_Castro_From_Face_Recognition_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Daniel Coelho de Castro, Sebastian Nowozin
Multi-Attention Multi-Class Constraint for Fine-grained Image Recognition	Attention-based learning for fine-grained image recognition remains a challenging task, where most of the existing methods treat each object part in isolation, while neglecting the correlations among them. In addition, the multi-stage or multi-scale mechanisms involved make the existing methods less efficient and hard to be trained end-to-end. In this paper, we propose a novel attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) which regulates multiple object parts among different input images. Our method first learns multiple attention region features of each input image through the one-squeeze multi-excitation (OSME) module, and then apply the multi-attention multi-class constraint (MAMC) in a metric learning framework. For each anchor feature, the MAMC functions by pulling same-attention same-class features closer, while pushing different-attention or different-class features away. Our method can be easily trained end-to-end, and is highly efficient which requires only one training stage. Moreover, we introduce Dogs-in-the-Wild, a comprehensive dog species dataset that surpasses similar existing datasets by category coverage, data volume and annotation quality. This dataset will be released upon acceptance to facilitate the research of fine-grained image recognition. Extensive experiments are conducted to show the substantial improvements of our method on four benchmark datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ming_Sun_Multi-Attention_Multi-Class_Constraint_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ming Sun, Yuchen Yuan, Feng Zhou, Errui Ding
HGMR: Hierarchical Gaussian Mixtures for Adaptive 3D Registration	Point cloud registration sits at the core of many important and challenging 3D perception problems including autonomous navigation, SLAM, object/scene recognition, and augmented reality. In this paper, we present a new registration algorithm that is able to achieve state-of-the-art speed and accuracy through its use of a Hierarchical Gaussian Mixture representation. Our method, Hierarchical Gaussian Mixture Registration (HGMR), constructs a top-down multi-scale representation of point cloud data by recursively running many small-scale data likelihood segmentations in parallel on a GPU. We leverage the resulting representation using a novel optimization criterion that adaptively finds the best scale to perform data association between spatial subsets of point cloud data. Compared to previous Iterative Closest Point and GMM-based techniques, our tree-based point association algorithm performs data association in logarithmic-time while dynamically adjusting the level of detail to best match the complexity and spatial distribution characteristics of local scene geometry. In addition, unlike other GMM methods that restrict covariances to be isotropic, our new PCA-based optimization criterion well-approximates the true MLE solution even when fully anisotropic Gaussian covariances are used. Efficient data association, multi-scale adaptability, and a robust MLE approximation produce an algorithm that is up to an order of magnitude both faster and more accurate than current state-of-the-art on a wide variety of 3D datasets captured from LiDAR to structured light.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Benjamin_Eckart_Fast_and_Accurate_ECCV_2018_paper.php	B.

Sidekick Policy Learning for Active Visual Exploration	We consider an active visual exploration scenario, where an agent must intelligently select its camera motions to efficiently reconstruct the full environment from only a limited set of narrow field-of-view glimpses. While the agent has full observability of the environment during training, it has only partial observability once deployed, being constrained by what portions it has seen and what camera motions are permissible. We introduce sidekick policy learning to capitalize on this imbalance of observability. The main idea is a preparatory learning phase that attempts simplified versions of the eventual exploration task, then guides the agent via reward shaping or initial policy supervision. To support interpretation of the resulting policies, we also develop a novel policy visualization technique. Results on active visual exploration tasks with 360 scenes and 3D objects show that sidekicks consistently improve performance and convergence rates over existing methods. Code, data and demos are available.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Santhosh_Kumar_Ramakrishnan_Sidekick_Policy_Learning_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Santhosh K.

Part-Aligned Bilinear Representations for Person Re-Identification	Comparing the appearance of corresponding body parts is essential for person re-identification. As body parts are frequently misaligned between the detected human boxes, an image representation that can handle this misalignment is required. In this paper, we propose a network that learns a part-aligned representation for person re-identification. Our model consists of a two-stream network, which generates appearance and body part feature maps respectively, and a bilinear-pooling layer that fuses two feature maps to an image descriptor. We show that it results in a compact descriptor, where the image matching similarity is equivalent to an aggregation of the local appearance similarities of the corresponding body parts. Since the image similarity does not depend on the relative positions of parts, our approach significantly reduces the part misalignment problem. Training the network does not require any part annotation on the person re-identification dataset. Instead, we simply initialize the part sub-stream using a pre-trained sub-network of an existing pose estimation network and train the whole network to minimize the re-identification loss. We validate the effectiveness of our approach by demonstrating its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark datasets including Market-1501, CUHK03, CUHK01 and DukeMTMC, and standard video dataset MARS.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yumin_Suh_Part-Aligned_Bilinear_Representations_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yumin Suh, Jingdong Wang, Siyu Tang, Tao Mei, Kyoung Mu Lee
Compressing the Input for CNNs with the First-Order Scattering Transform	We consider the first-order scattering transform as a candidate for reducing the signal processed by a convolutional neural network (CNN). We study this transformation and show theoretical and empirical evidence that in the case of natural images and sufficiently small translation invariance, this transform preserves most of the signal information needed for classification while substantially reducing the spatial resolution and total signal size. We demonstrate that cascading a CNN with this representations permits to perform on par with Imagenet classification models commonly used in downstream tasks such as the Resnet-50. We subsequently apply our Imagenet trained hybrid model as a base model on a detection system, which typically has larger image inputs. On Pascal VOC and COCO detection tasks we find this leads to substantial improvements in inference speed and training memory consumption compared to models trained directly on the input image.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Edouard_Oyallon_Compressing_the_Input_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Edouard Oyallon, Eugene Belilovsky, Sergey Zagoruyko, Michal Valko
Implicit 3D Orientation Learning for 6D Object Detection from RGB Images	We propose a real-time RGB-based pipeline for object detection and 6D pose estimation. Our novel 3D orientation estimation is based on a variant of the Denoising Autoencoder that is trained on simulated views of a 3D model using Domain Randomization. This so-called Augmented Autoencoder has several advantages over existing methods: It does not require real, pose-annotated training data, generalizes to various test sensors and inherently handles object and view symmetries. Instead of learning an explicit mapping from input images to object poses, it provides an implicit representation of object orientations defined by samples in a latent space. Experiments on the T-LESS and LineMOD datasets show that our method outperforms similar model-based approaches and competes with state-of-the art approaches that require real pose-annotated images.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Martin_Sundermeyer_Implicit_3D_Orientation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Martin Sundermeyer, Zoltan-Csaba Marton, Maximilian Durner, Manuel Brucker, Rudolph Triebel
Open Set Learning with Counterfactual Images	In open set recognition, a classifier must label instances of known classes while detecting instances of unknown classes not encountered during training. To detect unknown classes while still generalizing to new instances of existing classes, we introduce a dataset augmentation technique that we call counterfactual image generation. Our approach, based on generative adversarial networks, generates examples that are close to training set examples yet do not belong to any training category. By augmenting training with examples generated by this optimization, we can reformulate open set recognition as classification with one additional class, which includes the set of novel and unknown examples. Our approach outperforms existing open set recognition algorithms on a selection of image classification tasks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Lawrence_Neal_Open_Set_Learning_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Lawrence Neal, Matthew Olson, Xiaoli Fern, Weng-Keen Wong, Fuxin Li
Deep Recursive HDRI: Inverse Tone Mapping using Generative Adversarial Networks	High dynamic range images contain luminance information of the physical world and provide more realistic experience than conventional low dynamic range images. Because most images have a low dynamic range, recovering the lost dynamic range from a single low dynamic range image is still prevalent. We propose a novel method for restoring the lost dynamic range from a single low dynamic range image through a deep neural network. The proposed method is the first framework to create high dynamic range images based on the estimated multi-exposure stack using the conditional generative adversarial network structure. In this architecture, we train the network by setting an objective function that is a combination of L1 loss and generative adversarial network loss. In addition, this architecture has a simplified structure than the existing networks. In the experimental results, the proposed network generated a multi-exposure stack consisting of realistic images with varying exposure values while avoiding artifacts on public benchmarks, compared with the existing methods. In addition, both the multi-exposure stacks and high dynamic range images estimated by the proposed method are significantly similar to the ground truth than other state-of-the-art algorithms.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Siyeong_Lee_Deep_Recursive_HDRI_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Siyeong Lee, Gwon Hwan An, Suk-Ju Kang
Quadtree Convolutional Neural Networks	This paper presents a Quadtree Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) for efficiently learning from image datasets representing sparse data such as handwriting, pen strokes, freehand sketches, etc. Instead of storing the sparse sketches in regular dense tensors, our method decomposes and represents the image as a linear quadtree that is only refined in the non-empty portions of the image. The actual image data corresponding to non-zero pixels is stored in the finest nodes of the quadtree. Convolution and pooling operations are restricted to the sparse pixels, leading to better efficiency in computation time as well as memory usage. Specifically, the computational and memory costs in QCNN grow linearly in the number of non-zero pixels, as opposed to traditional CNNs where the costs are quadratic in the number of pixels. This enables QCNN to learn from sparse images much faster and process high resolution images without the memory constraints faced by traditional CNNs. We study QCNN on four sparse image datasets for classification and sketch simplification tasks. The results show that QCNN can obtain comparable accuracy with large reduction in computational and memory costs.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Pradeep_Kumar_Jayaraman_Quadtree_Convolutional_Neural_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Pradeep Kumar Jayaraman, Jianhan Mei, Jianfei Cai, Jianmin Zheng
Combining 3D Model Contour Energy and Keypoints for Object Tracking	We present a new combined approach for monocular model-based 3D tracking. A preliminary object pose is estimated by using a keypoint-based technique. The pose is then refined by optimizing the contour energy function. The energy determines the degree of correspondence between the contour of the model projection and the image edges. It is calculated based on both the intensity and orientation of the raw image gradient. For optimization, we propose a technique and search area constraints that allow overcoming the local optima and taking into account information obtained through keypoint-based pose estimation. Owing to its combined nature, our method eliminates numerous issues of keypoint-based and edge-based approaches. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by comparing it with state-of-the-art methods on a public benchmark dataset that includes videos with various lighting conditions, movement patterns, and speed.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Bogdan_Bugaev_Combining_3D_Model_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Bogdan Bugaev, Anton Kryshchenko, Roman Belov
Pairwise Confusion for Fine-Grained Visual Classification	Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) datasets contain small sample sizes, along with significant intra-class variation and inter-class similarity. While prior work has addressed intra-class variation using localization and segmentation techniques, inter-class similarity may also affect feature learning and reduce classification performance. In this work, we address this problem using a novel optimization procedure for the end-to-end neural network training on FGVC tasks. Our procedure, called Pairwise Confusion (PC) reduces overfitting by intentionally introducing confusion in the activations. With PC regularization, we obtain state-of-the-art performance on six of the most widely-used FGVC datasets and demonstrate improved localization ability. PC is easy to implement, does not need excessive hyperparameter tuning during training, and does not add significant overhead during test time.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Abhimanyu_Dubey_Improving_Fine-Grained_Visual_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Abhimanyu Dubey, Otkrist Gupta, Pei Guo, Ramesh Raskar, Ryan Farrell, Nikhil Naik
Image Manipulation with Perceptual Discriminators	Systems that perform image manipulation using deep convolutional networks have achieved remarkable realism. Perceptual losses and losses based on adversarial discriminators are the two main classes of learning objectives behind these advances. In this work, we show how these two ideas can be combined in a principled and non-additive manner for unaligned image translation tasks. This is accomplished through a special architecture of the discriminator network inside generative adversarial learning framework. The new architecture, that we call a perceptual discriminator, embeds the convolutional parts of a pre-trained deep classification network inside the discriminator network. The resulting architecture can be trained on unaligned image datasets, while benefiting from the robustness and efficiency of perceptual losses. We demonstrate the merits of the new architecture in a series of qualitative and quantitative comparisons with baseline approaches and state-of-the-art frameworks for unaligned image translation.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Diana_Sungatullina_Image_Manipulation_with_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Diana Sungatullina, Egor Zakharov, Dmitry Ulyanov, Victor Lempitsky
Visual Question Generation for Class Acquisition of Unknown Objects	Traditional image recognition methods only consider objects belonging to already learned classes. However, since training a recognition model with every object class in the world is unfeasible, a way of getting information on unknown objects (i.e., objects whose class has not been learned) is necessary. A way for an image recognition system to learn new classes could be asking a human about objects that are unknown. In this paper, we propose a method for generating questions about unknown objects in an image, as means to get information about classes that have not been learned. Our method consists of a module for proposing objects, a module for identifying unknown objects, and a module for generating questions about unknown objects. The experimental results via human evaluation show that our method can successfully get information about unknown objects in an image dataset.

Robust fitting in computer vision: easy or hard?	"Robust model fitting plays a vital role in computer vision, and research into algorithms for robust fitting continues to be active. Arguably the most popular paradigm for robust fitting in computer vision is consensus maximisation, which strives to find the model parameters that maximise the number of inliers. Despite the significant developments in algorithms for consensus maximisation, there has been a lack of fundamental analysis of the problem in the computer vision literature. In particular, whether consensus maximisation is ""tractable"" remains a question that has not been rigorously dealt with, thus making it difficult to assess and compare the performance of proposed algorithms, relative to what is theoretically achievable. To shed light on these issues, we present several computational hardness results for consensus maximisation. Our results underline the fundamental intractability of the problem, and resolve several ambiguities existing in the literature."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tat-Jun_Chin_Robust_fitting_in_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tat-Jun Chin, Zhipeng Cai, Frank Neumann
MVTec D2S: Densely Segmented Supermarket Dataset	We introduce the Densely Segmented Supermarket (D2S) dataset, a novel benchmark for instance-aware semantic segmentation in an industrial domain. It contains 21000 high-resolution images with pixel-wise labels of all object instances. The objects comprise groceries and everyday products from 60 categories. The benchmark is designed such that it resembles the real-world setting of an automatic checkout, inventory, or warehouse system. The training images only contain objects of a single class on a homogeneous background, while the validation and test sets are much more complex and diverse. To further benchmark the robustness of instance segmentation methods, the scenes are acquired with different lightings, rotations, and backgrounds. We ensure that there are no ambiguities in the labels and that every instance is labeled comprehensively. The annotations are pixel-precise and allow using crops of single instances for articial data augmentation. The dataset covers several challenges highly relevant in the field, such as a limited amount of training data and a high diversity in the test and validation sets. The evaluation of state-of-the-art object detection and instance segmentation methods on D2S reveals significant room for improvement.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Patrick_Follmann_D2S_Densely_Segmented_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Patrick Follmann, Tobias Bottger, Philipp Hartinger, Rebecca Konig, Markus Ulrich
Deep Variational Metric Learning	Deep metric learning has been extensively explored recently, which trains a deep neural network to produce discriminative embedding features. Most existing methods usually enforce the model to be indiscriminating to intra-class variance, which makes the model over-fitting to the training set to minimize loss functions on these specific changes and leads to low generalization power on unseen classes. However, these methods ignore a fact that in the central latent space, the distribution of variance within classes is actually independent on classes. In this paper, we propose a deep variational metric learning (DVML) framework to explicitly model the intra-class variance and disentangle the intra-class invariance, namely, the class centers. With the learned distribution of intra-class variance, we can simultaneously generate discriminative samples to improve robustness. Our method is applicable to most of existing metric learning algorithms, and extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets including CUB-200-2011, Cars196 and Stanford Online Products show that our DVML significantly boosts the performance of currently popular deep metric learning methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xudong_Lin_Deep_Variational_Metric_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xudong Lin, Yueqi Duan, Qiyuan Dong, Jiwen Lu, Jie Zhou
Collaborative Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Object Tracking	In this paper, we propose a collaborative deep reinforcement learning (C-DRL) method for multi-object tracking. Most existing multi-object tracking methods employ the tracking-by-detection strategy which first detects objects in each frame and then associates them across different frames. However, the performance of these methods rely heavily on the detection results, which are usually unsatisfied in many real applications, especially in crowded scenes. To address this, we develop a deep prediction-decision network in our C-DRL, which simultaneously detects and predicts objects under a unified network via deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, we consider each object as an agent and track it via the prediction network, and seek the optimal tracked results by exploiting the collaborative interactions of different agents and environments via the decision network, so that the influences of occlusions and noisy detection results can be well alleviated. Experimental results on the challenging MOT15 and MOT16 benchmarks are presented to show the efficiency of our approach.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Liangliang_Ren_Collaborative_Deep_Reinforcement_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Liangliang Ren, Jiwen Lu, Zifeng Wang, Qi Tian, Jie Zhou
ExFuse: Enhancing Feature Fusion for Semantic Segmentation	Modern semantic segmentation frameworks usually combine low-level and high-level features from pre-trained backbone convolutional models to boost performance. In this paper, we first point out that a simple fusion of low-level and high-level features could be less effective because of the gap in semantic levels and spatial resolution. We find that introducing semantic information into low-level features and high-resolution details into high-level features are more effective for the later fusion. Based on this observation, we propose a new framework, named ExFuse, to bridge the gap between low-level and high-level features thus significantly improve the segmentation quality by 4.0% in total. Furthermore, we evaluate our approach on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark and achieve 87.9% mean IoU, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art results.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhenli_Zhang_ExFuse_Enhancing_Feature_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhenli Zhang, Xiangyu Zhang, Chao Peng, Xiangyang Xue, Jian Sun
Massively Parallel Video Networks	We introduce a class of causal video understanding models that aims to improve efficiency of video processing by maximising throughput, minimising latency, and reducing the number of clock cycles. Leveraging operation pipelining and multi-rate clocks, these models perform a minimal amount of computation (e.g. as few as four convolutional layers) for each frame per timestep to produce an output. The models are still very deep, with dozens of such operations being performed but in a pipelined fashion that enables depth-parallel computation. We illustrate the proposed principles by applying them to existing image architectures and analyse their behaviour on two video tasks: action recognition and human keypoint localisation. The results show that a significant degree of parallelism, and implicitly speedup, can be achieved with little loss in performance.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Viorica_Patraucean_Massively_Parallel_Video_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Joao Carreira, Viorica Patraucean, Laurent Mazare, Andrew Zisserman, Simon Osindero
Fast and Accurate Intrinsic Symmetry Detection	In computer vision and graphics, various types of symmetries are extensively studied since symmetry present in objects is a fundamental cue for understanding the shape and the structure of objects. In this work, we detect the intrinsic reflective symmetry in triangle meshes where we have to find the intrinsically symmetric point for each point of the shape. We establish correspondences between functions defined on the shapes by extending the functional map framework and then recover the point-to-point correspondences. Previous approaches using the functional map for this task find the functional correspondences matrix by solving a non-linear optimization problem which makes them slow. In this work, we propose a closed form solution for this matrix which makes our approach faster. We find the closed-form solution based on our following results. If the given shape is intrinsically symmetric, then the shortest length geodesic between two intrinsically symmetric points is also intrinsically symmetric. If an eigenfunction of the Laplace-Beltrami operator for the given shape is an even (odd) function, then its restriction on the shortest length geodesic between two intrinsically symmetric points is also an even (odd) function. The sign of a low-frequency eigenfunction is the same on the neighboring points. Our method is invariant to the ordering of the eigenfunctions and has the least time complexity. We achieve the best performance on the SCAPE dataset and comparable performance with the state-of-the-art methods on the TOSCA dataset.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Rajendra_Nagar_Fast_and_Accurate_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Rajendra Nagar, Shanmuganathan Raman
Recognition in Terra Incognita	It is desirable for detection and classification algorithms to generalize to unfamiliar environments, but suitable benchmarks for quantitatively studying this phenomenon are not yet available. We present a dataset designed to measure recognition generalization to novel environments. The images in our dataset are harvested from twenty camera traps deployed to monitor animal populations. Camera traps are fixed at one location, hence the background changes little across images; capture is triggered automatically, hence there is no human bias. The challenge is learning recognition in a handful of locations, and generalizing animal detection and classification to new locations where no training data is available. In our experiments state-of-the-art algorithms show excellent performance when tested at the same location where they were trained. However, we find that generalization to new locations is poor, especially for classification systems.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Beery_Recognition_in_Terra_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Sara Beery, Grant Van Horn, Pietro Perona
Hashing with Binary Matrix Pursuit	We propose theoretical and empirical improvements for two-stage hashing methods. We first provide a theoretical analysis on the quality of the binary codes and show that, under mild assumptions, a residual learning scheme can construct binary codes that fit any neighborhood structure with arbitrary accuracy. Secondly, we show that with high-capacity hash functions such as CNNs, binary code inference can be greatly simplified for many standard neighborhood definitions, yielding smaller optimization problems and more robust codes. Incorporating our findings, we propose a novel two-stage hashing method that significantly outperforms previous hashing studies on widely used image retrieval benchmarks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Fatih_Cakir_Hashing_with_Binary_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Fatih Cakir, Kun He, Stan Sclaroff
Choose Your Neuron: Incorporating Domain Knowledge through Neuron-Importance	"Individual neurons in convolutional neural networks supervised for image-level classification tasks have been shown to implicitly learn semantically meaningful concepts ranging from simple textures and shapes to whole or partial objects – forming a ""dictionary"" of concepts acquired through the learning process. In this work we introduce a simple, efficient zero-shot learning approach based on this observation. Our approach, which we call Neuron Importance-Aware Weight Transfer (NIWT), learns to map domain knowledge about novel ""unseen"" classes onto this dictionary of learned concepts and then optimizes for network parameters that can effectively combine these concepts – essentially learning classifiers by discovering and composing learned semantic concepts in deep networks. Our approach shows improvements over previous approaches on the CUBirds and AWA2 generalized zero-shot learning benchmarks. We demonstrate our approach on a diverse set of semantic inputs as external domain knowledge including attributes and natural language captions. Moreover by learning inverse mappings, NIWT can provide visual and textual explanations for the predictions made by the newly learned classifiers and provide neuron names.

Efficient Dense Point Cloud Object Reconstruction using Deformation Vector Fields	Most existing CNN-based methods for single-view 3D object reconstruction represent a 3D object as either a 3D voxel occupancy grid or multiple depth-mask image pairs. However, these representations are inefficient since empty voxels or background pixels are wasteful. We propose a novel approach that addresses this limitation by replacing masks with ''deformation-fields''. Given a single image at an arbitrary viewpoint, a CNN predicts multiple surfaces, each in a canonical location relative to the object. Each surface comprises a depth-map and corresponding deformation-field that ensures every pixel-depth pair in the depth-map lies on the object surface. These surfaces are then fused to form the full 3D shape. During training, we use a combination of per-view and multi-view losses. The novel multi-view loss encourages the 3D points back-projected from a particular view to be consistent across views. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our method on single-view 3D object reconstruction.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Kejie_Li_Efficient_Dense_Point_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Kejie Li, Trung Pham, Huangying Zhan, Ian Reid
CornerNet: Detecting Objects as Paired Keypoints	We propose CornerNet, a new approach to object detection where we detect an object bounding box as a pair of keypoints, the top-left corner and the bottom-right corner, using a single convolution neural network. By detecting objects as paired keypoints, we eliminate the need for designing a set of anchor boxes commonly used in prior single-stage detectors. In addition to our novel formulation, we introduce corner pooling, a new type of pooling layer that helps the network better localize the corners. Experiments show that CornerNet achieves a 42.1% AP on MS COCO, outperforming all existing one-stage detectors.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hei_Law_CornerNet_Detecting_Objects_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hei Law, Jia Deng
Clustering Convolutional Kernels to Compress Deep Neural Networks	In this paper, we propose a novel method to compress CNNs by reconstructing the network from a small set of spatial convolution kernels. Starting from a pre-trained model, we extract representative 2D kernel centroids using k-means clustering. Each centroid replaces the corresponding kernels of the same cluster, and we use indexed representations instead of saving whole kernels. Kernels in the same cluster share their weights, and we fine-tune the model while keeping the compressed state. Furthermore, we also suggest an efficient way of removing redundant calculations in the compressed convolutional layers. We experimentally show that our technique works well without harming the accuracy of widely-used CNNs. Also, our ResNet-18 even outperforms its uncompressed counterpart at ILSVRC2012 classification task with over 10x compression ratio.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Sanghyun_Son_Clustering_Kernels_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Sanghyun Son, Seungjun Nah, Kyoung Mu Lee
Learning Category-Specific Mesh Reconstruction from Image Collections	We present a learning framework for recovering the 3D shape, camera, and texture of an object from a single image. The shape is represented as a deformable 3D mesh model of an object category where a shape is parameterized by a learned mean shape and per-instance predicted deformation. Our approach allows leveraging an annotated image collection for training, where the deformable model and the 3D prediction mechanism are learned without relying on ground-truth 3D or multi-view supervision. Our representation enables us to go beyond existing 3D prediction approaches by incorporating texture inference as prediction of an image in a canonical appearance space. Additionally, we show that semantic keypoints can be easily associated with the predicted shapes. We present qualitative and quantitative results of our approach on CUB and PASCAL3D datasets and show that we can learn to predict diverse shapes and textures across birds using only annotated image collections.

Dynamic Filtering with Large Sampling Field for ConvNets	We propose a dynamic filtering strategy with large sampling field for ConvNets (LS-DFN), where the position-specific kernels learn from not only the identical position but also multiple sampled neighbour regions. During sampling, residual learning is introduced to ease training and an attention mechanism is applied to fuse features from different samples. Such multiple samples enlarge the kernels' receptive fields significantly without requiring more parameters. While LS-DFN inherits the advantages of DFN, namely avoiding feature map blurring by position-wise kernels while keeping translation invariance, it also efficiently alleviates the overfitting issue caused by much more parameters than normal CNNs. Our model is efficient and can be trained end-to-end via standard back-propagation. We demonstrate the merits of our LS-DFN on both sparse and dense prediction tasks involving object detection, semantic segmentation and flow estimation. Our results show LS-DFN enjoys stronger recognition abilities in object detection and semantic segmentation tasks on VOC benchmark and sharper responses in flow estimation on FlyingChairs dataset compared to strong baselines.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jialin_Wu_Dynamic_Sampling_Convolutional_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jialin Wu, Dai Li, Yu Yang, Chandrajit Bajaj, Xiangyang Ji
CAR-Net: Clairvoyant Attentive Recurrent Network	We present an interpretable framework for path prediction that leverages dependencies between agents' behaviors and their spatial navigation environment. We exploit two sources of information: the past motion trajectory of the agent of interest and a wide top-view image of the navigation scene. We propose a Clairvoyant Attentive Recurrent Network (CAR-Net) that learns where to look in a large image of the scene when solving the path prediction task. Our method can attend to any area, or a combination of areas, within the raw image (e.g., road intersections) when predicting the trajectory of the agent. This allows us to visualize fine-grained semantic elements of navigation scenes that influence the prediction of trajectories. To study the impact of space on agents' trajectories, we build a new dataset made of top-view images of hundreds of scenes (Formula One racing tracks) where agents' behaviors are heavily influenced by known areas in the images (e.g., upcoming turns). CAR-Net successfully attends to these salient regions. Additionally, CAR-Net reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on the standard trajectory forecasting benchmark, Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). Finally, we show CAR-Net's ability to generalize to unseen scenes.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Amir_Sadeghian_CAR-Net_Clairvoyant_Attentive_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Amir Sadeghian, Ferdinand Legros, Maxime Voisin, Ricky Vesel, Alexandre Alahi, Silvio Savarese
PM-GANs: Discriminative Representation Learning for Action Recognition Using Partial-modalities	Data of different modalities generally convey complimentary but heterogeneous information, and a more discriminative representation is often preferred by combining multiple data modalities like the RGB and infrared features. However in reality, obtaining both data channels is challenging due to many limitations. For example, the RGB surveillance cameras are often restricted from private spaces, which is in conflict with the need of abnormal activity detection for personal security. As a result, using partial data channels to build a full representation of multi-modalities is clearly desired. In this paper, we propose a novel Partial-modal Generative Adversarial Networks (PM-GANs) that learns a full-modal representation using data from only partial modalities. The full representation is achieved by a generated representation in place of the missing data channel. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the performance of our proposed method on action recognition, compared with four state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, a new Infrared-Visible Dataset for action recognition is introduced, and will be the first publicly available action dataset that contains paired infrared and visible spectrum.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Lan_Wang_PM-GANs_Discriminative_Representation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Lan Wang, Chenqiang Gao, Luyu Yang, Yue Zhao, Wangmeng Zuo, Deyu Meng

In our setting, the training data for the source categories have bounding box annotations, while those for the target categories only have image-level annotations. Current state-of-the-art approaches focus on image-level visual or semantic similarity to adapt a detector trained on the source categories to the new target categories. In contrast, our key idea is to (i) use similarity not at the image-level, but rather at the region-level, and (ii) leverage richer common-sense (based on attribute, spatial, etc.) to guide the algorithm towards learning the correct detections. We acquire such common-sense cues automatically from readily-available knowledge bases without any extra human effort. On the challenging MS COCO dataset, we find that common-sense knowledge can substantially improve detection performance over existing transfer-learning baselines.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Krishna_Kumar_Singh_Transferring_Common-Sense_Knowledge_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Krishna Kumar Singh, Santosh Divvala, Ali Farhadi, Yong Jae Lee
Mutual Learning to Adapt for Joint Human Parsing and Pose Estimation	This paper presents a novel Mutual Learning to Adapt model (MuLA) for joint human parsing and pose estimation. It effectively exploits mutual benefits from both tasks and simultaneously boosts their performance. Different from existing post-processing or multi-task learning based methods, MuLA predicts dynamic task-specific model parameters via recurrently leveraging guidance information from its parallel tasks. Thus MuLA can fast adapt parsing and pose models to provide more powerful representations by incorporating information from their counterparts, giving more robust and accurate results. MuLA is implemented with convolutional neural networks and end-to-end trainable. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks LIP and extended PASCAL-Person-Part demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MuLA model with superior performance to well established baselines.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xuecheng_Nie_Mutual_Learning_to_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xuecheng Nie, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan
Joint Blind Motion Deblurring and Depth Estimation of Light Field	Removing camera motion blur from a single light field is a challenging task since it is highly ill-posed inverse problem. The problem becomes even worse when blur kernel varies spatially due to scene depth variation and high-order camera motion. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate all blur model variables jointly, including latent sub-aperture image, camera motion, and scene depth from the blurred 4D light field. Exploiting multi-view nature of a light field relieves the inverse property of the optimization by utilizing strong depth cues and multi-view blur observation. The proposed joint estimation achieves high quality light field deblurring and depth estimation simultaneously under arbitrary 6-DOF camera motion and unconstrained scene depth. Intensive experiment on real and synthetic blurred light field confirms that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art light field deblurring and depth estimation methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Dongwoo_Lee_Joint_Blind_Motion_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Dongwoo Lee, Haesol Park, In Kyu Park, Kyoung Mu Lee
Action Search: Spotting Actions in Videos and Its Application to Temporal Action Localization	State-of-the-art temporal action detectors inefficiently search the entire video for specific actions. Despite the encouraging progress these methods achieve, it is crucial to design automated approaches that only explore parts of the video which are the most relevant to the actions being searched for. To address this need, we propose the new problem of action spotting in video, which we define as finding a specific action in a video while observing a small portion of that video. Inspired by the observation that humans are extremely efficient and accurate in spotting and finding action instances in video, we propose Action Search, a novel Recurrent Neural Network approach that mimics the way humans spot actions. Moreover, to address the absence of data recording the behavior of human annotators, we put forward the Human Searches dataset, which compiles the search sequences employed by human annotators spotting actions in the AVA and THUMOS14 datasets. We consider temporal action localization as an application of the action spotting problem. Experiments on the THUMOS14 dataset reveal that our model is not only able to explore the video efficiently (observing on average 17.3% of the video) but it also accurately finds human activities with 30.8% mAP.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Humam_Alwassel_Action_Search_Spotting_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Humam Alwassel, Fabian Caba Heilbron, Bernard Ghanem
RefocusGAN: Scene Refocusing using a Single Image	Post-capture control of the focus position of an image is a useful photographic tool. Changing the focus of a single image involves the complex task of simultaneously estimating the radiance and the defocus radius of all scene points. We introduce RefocusGAN, a deblur-then-reblur approach to single image refocusing. We train conditional adversarial networks for deblurring and refocusing using wide-aperture images created from light-fields. By appropriately conditioning our networks with a focus measure, an in-focus image and a refocus control parameter, we are able to achieve generic free-form refocusing over a single image.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Parikshit_Sakurikar_Single_Image_Scene_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Parikshit Sakurikar, Ishit Mehta, Vineeth N.

Efficient Sliding Window Computation for NN-Based Template Matching	Template matching is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with many applications. Existing methods use sliding window computation for choosing an image-window that best matches the tem- plate. For classic algorithms based on SSD, SAD and normalized cross- correlation, efficient algorithms have been developed allowing them to run in real-time. Current state of the art algorithms are based on nearest neighbor (NN) matching of small patches within the template to patches in the image. These algorithms yield state-of-the-art results since they can deal better with changes in appearance, viewpoint, illumination, non- rigid transformations, and occlusion. However, NN-based algorithms are relatively slow not only due to NN computation for each image patch, but also since their sliding window computation is inecient. We there- fore propose in this paper an efficient NN-based algorithm. Its accuracy is similar (in some cases slightly better) than the existing algorithms and its running time is 44-200 times faster depending on the sizes of the images and templates used. The main contribution of our method is an algorithm for incrementally computing the score of each image window based on the score computed for the previous window. This is in con- trast to computing the score for each image window independently, as in previous NN-based methods. The complexity of our method is there- fore O(|I|) instead of O(|I||T|), where I and T are the image and the template respectively.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Lior_Talker_Efficient_Sliding_Window_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Lior Talker, Yael Moses, Ilan Shimshoni
SDC-Net: Video prediction using spatially-displaced convolution	We present an approach for high-resolution video frame prediction by conditioning on both past frames and past optical flows. Previous approaches rely on resampling past frames, guided by a learned future optical flow, or on direct generation of pixels. Resampling based on flow is insufficient because it cannot deal with disocclusions. Generative models currently lead to blurry results. Recent approaches synthesis a pixel by convolving input patches with a predicted kernel. However, their memory requirement increases with kernel size. Here, we present spatially-displaced convolution (SDC) module for video frame prediction. We learn a motion vector and a kernel for each pixel and synthesize a pixel by applying the kernel at a displaced location in the source image, defined by the predicted motion vector. Our approach inherits the merits of both vector-based and kernel-based approaches, while ameliorating their respective disadvantages. We train our model on 428K unlabelled 1080p video game frames. Our approach produces state-of-the-art results, achieving an SSIM score of 0.904 on high-definition YouTube-8M videos, 0.918 on Caltech Pedestrian videos. Our model handles large motion effectively and synthesizes crisp frames with consistent motion.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Fitsum_Reda_SDC-Net_Video_prediction_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Fitsum A.

GeoDesc: Learning Local Descriptors by Integrating Geometry Constraints	Learned local descriptors based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved significant improvements on patch-based benchmarks, whereas not having demonstrated strong generalization ability on recent benchmarks of image-based 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we mitigate this limitation by proposing a novel local descriptor learning approach that integrates geometry constraints from multi-view reconstructions, which benefit the learning process in data generation, data sampling and loss computation. We refer to the proposed descriptor as GeoDesc, and demonstrate its superior performance on various large-scale benchmarks, and in particular show its great success on challenging reconstruction cases. Moreover, we provide guidelines towards practical integration of learned descriptors in Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines, showing the good trade-off that GeoDesc delivers to 3D reconstruction tasks between accuracy and efficiency.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zixin_Luo_Learning_Local_Descriptors_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zixin Luo, Tianwei Shen, Lei Zhou, Siyu Zhu, Runze Zhang, Yao Yao, Tian Fang, Long Quan
Hierarchical Relational Networks for Group Activity Recognition and Retrieval	Modeling structured relationships between people in a scene is an important step toward visual understanding. We present a Hierarchical Relational Network that computes relational representations of people, given graph structures describing potential interactions. Each relational layer is fed individual person representations and a potential relationship graph. Relational representations of each person are created based on their connections in this particular graph. We demonstrate the efficacy of this model by applying it in both supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms. First, given a video sequence of people doing a collective activity, the relational scene representation is utilized for multi-person activity recognition. Second, we propose a Relational Autoencoder model for unsupervised learning of features for action and scene retrieval. Finally, a Denoising Autoencoder variant is presented to infer missing people in the scene from their context. Empirical results demonstrate that this approach learns relational feature representations that can effectively discriminate person and group activity classes.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Mostafa_Ibrahim_Hierarchical_Relational_Networks_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Mostafa S.

Deep High Dynamic Range Imaging with Large Foreground Motions	This paper proposes the first non-flow-based deep framework for high dynamic range (HDR) imaging of dynamic scenes with large-scale foreground motions. In state-of-the-art deep HDR imaging, input images are first aligned using optical flows before merging, which are still error-prone due to occlusion and large motions. In stark contrast to flow-based methods, we formulate HDR imaging as an image translation problem without optical flows. Moreover, our simple translation network can automatically hallucinate plausible HDR details in the presence of total occlusion, saturation and under-exposure, which are otherwise almost impossible to recover by conventional optimization approaches. Our framework can also be extended for different reference images. We performed extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons to show that our approach produces excellent results where color artifacts and geometric distortions are significantly reduced compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and is robust across various inputs, including images without radiometric calibration.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Shangzhe_Wu_Deep_High_Dynamic_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Shangzhe Wu, Jiarui Xu, Yu-Wing Tai, Chi-Keung Tang
End-to-End Learning of Driving Models with Surround-View Cameras and Route Planners	For human drivers, having rear and side-view mirrors is vital for safe driving. They deliver a more complete view of what is happening around the car. Human drivers also heavily exploit their mental map for navigation. Nonetheless, several methods have been published that learn driving models with only a front-facing camera and without a route planner. This lack of information renders the self-driving task quite intractable. We investigate the problem in a more realistic setting, which consists of a surround-view camera system with eight cameras, a route planner, and a CAN bus reader. In particular, we develop a sensor setup that provides data for a 360-degree view of the area surrounding the vehicle, the driving route to the destination, and low-level driving maneuvers (e.g. steering angle and speed) by human drivers. With such a sensor setup we collect a new driving dataset, covering diverse driving scenarios and varying weather/illumination conditions. Finally, we learn a novel driving model by integrating information from the surround-view cameras and the route planner. Two route planners are exploited: 1) by representing the planned routes on OpenStreetMap as a stack of GPS coordinates, and 2) by rendering the planned routes on TomTom Go Mobile and recording the progression into a video. Our experiments show that: 1) 360-degree surround-view cameras help avoid failures made with a single front-view camera, in particular for city driving and intersection scenarios; and 2) route planners help the driving task significantly, especially for steering angle prediction.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Simon_Hecker_Learning_to_Drive_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Simon Hecker, Dengxin Dai, Luc Van Gool
Generative Semantic Manipulation with Mask-Contrasting GAN	Despite the promising results on paired/unpaired image-to-image translation achieved by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), prior works often only transfer the low-level information (e.g. color or texture changes), but fail to manipulate high-level semantic meanings (e.g., geometric structure or content) of different object regions. On the other hand, while some researches can synthesize compelling real-world images given a class label or caption, they cannot condition on arbitrary shapes or structures, which largely limits their application scenarios and interpretive capability of model results. In this work, we focus on a more challenging semantic manipulation task, aiming at modifying the semantic meaning of an object while preserving its own characteristics (e.g. viewpoints and shapes), such as cow$ ightarrow$sheep, motor$ ightarrow$ bicycle, cat$ ightarrow$dog. To tackle such large semantic changes, we introduce a contrasting GAN (contrast-GAN) with a novel adversarial contrasting objective which is able to perform all types of semantic translations with one category-conditional generator. Instead of directly making the synthesized samples close to target data as previous GANs did, our adversarial contrasting objective optimizes over the distance comparisons between samples, that is, enforcing the manipulated data be semantically closer to the real data with target category than the input data. Equipped with the new contrasting objective, a novel mask-conditional contrast-GAN architecture is proposed to enable disentangle image background with object semantic changes. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on several semantic manipulation tasks on ImageNet and MSCOCO dataset show considerable performance gain by our contrast-GAN over other conditional GANs.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Liang_Generative_Semantic_Manipulation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiaodan Liang, Hao Zhang, Liang Lin, Eric Xing
Visual Question Answering as a Meta Learning Task	The predominant approach to Visual Question Answering (VQA) demands that the model represents within its weights all of the information required to answer any question about any image. Learning this information from any real training set seems unlikely, and representing it in a reasonable number of weights doubly so. We propose instead to approach VQA as a meta learning task, thus separating the question answering method from the information required. At test time, the method is provided with a support set of example questions/answers, over which it reasons to resolve the given question. The support set is not fixed and can be extended without retraining, thereby expanding the capabilities of the model. To exploit this dynamically provided information, we adapt a state-of-the-art VQA model with two techniques from the recent meta learning literature, namely prototypical networks and meta networks. Experiments demonstrate the capability of the system to learn to produce completely novel answers (i.e. never seen during training) from examples provided at test time. In comparison to the existing state of the art, the proposed method produces qualitatively distinct results with higher recall of rare answers, and a better sample efficiency that allows training with little initial data. More importantly, it represents an important step towards vision-and-language methods that can learn and reason on-the-fly.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Damien_Teney_Visual_Question_Answering_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Damien Teney, Anton van den Hengel
Toward Scale-Invariance and Position-Sensitive Region Proposal Networks	Accurately localising object proposals is an important precondition for high detection rate for the state-of-the-art object detection frameworks. The accuracy of an object detection method has been shown highly related to the average recall (AR) of the proposals. In this work, we propose an advanced object proposal network in favour of translation-invariance for objectness classification, translation-variance for bounding box regression, large effective receptive fields for capturing global context and scale-invariance for dealing with a range of object sizes from extremely small to large. The design of the network architecture aims to be simple while being effective and with real-time performance. Without bells and whistles the proposed object proposal network significantly improves AR at 1,000 proposals by 35% and 45% on PASCAL VOC and COCO dataset respectively and has a fast inference time of 44.8 ms for input image size of 640x640. Empirical studies have also shown that the proposed method is class-agnostic to be generalised for general object proposal.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hsueh-Fu_Lu_Toward_Scale-Invariance_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hsueh-Fu Lu, Xiaofei Du, Ping-Lin Chang
Weakly-supervised Video Summarization using Variational Encoder-Decoder and Web Prior	Video summarization is a challenging under-constrained problem because the underlying summary of a single video strongly depends on users' subjective understandings. Data-driven approaches, such as deep neural networks, can deal with the ambiguity inherent in this task to some extent, but it is extremely expensive to acquire the temporal annotations of a large-scale video dataset. To leverage the plentiful web-crawled videos to improve the performance of video summarization, we present a generative modelling framework to learn the latent semantic video representations to bridge the benchmark data and web data. Specifically, our framework couples two important components: a variational autoencoder for learning the latent semantics from web videos, and an encoder-attention-decoder for saliency estimation of raw video and summary generation. A loss term to learn the semantic matching between the generated summaries and web videos is presented, and the overall framework is further formulated into a unified conditional variational encoder-decoder, called variational encoder-summarizer-decoder (VESD). Experiments conducted on the challenging datasets CoSum and TVSum demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed VESD to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Simultaneous Edge Alignment and Learning	Edge detection is among the most fundamental vision problems for its role in perceptual grouping and its wide applications. Recent advances in representation learning have led to considerable improvements in this area. Many state of the art edge detection models are learned with fully convolutional networks (FCNs). However, FCN-based edge learning tends to be vulnerable to misaligned labels due to the delicate structure of edges. While such problem was considered in evaluation benchmarks, similar issue has not been explicitly addressed in general edge learning. In this paper, we show that label misalignment can cause considerably degraded edge learning quality, and address this issue by proposing a simultaneous edge alignment and learning framework. To this end, we formulate a probabilistic model where edge alignment is treated as latent variable optimization, and is learned end-to-end during network training. Experiments show several applications of this work, including improved edge detection with state of the art performance, and automatic refinement of noisy annotations.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhiding_Yu_SEAL_A_Framework_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhiding Yu, Weiyang Liu, Yang Zou, Chen Feng, Srikumar Ramalingam, B.

Online Multi-Object Tracking with Dual Matching Attention Networks	In this paper, we propose an online Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) approach which integrates the merits of single object tracking and data association methods in a unified framework to handle noisy detections and frequent interactions between targets. Specifically, for applying single object tracking in MOT, we introduce a cost-sensitive tracking loss based on the state-of-the-art visual tracker, which encourages the model to focus on hard negative distractors during online learning. For data association, we propose Dual Matching Attention Networks (DMAN) with both spatial and temporal attention mechanisms. The spatial attention module generates dual attention maps which enable the network to focus on the matching patterns of the input image pair, while the temporal attention module adaptively allocates different levels of attention to different samples in the tracklet to suppress noisy observations. Experimental results on the MOT benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against both online and offline trackers in terms of identity-preserving metrics.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ji_Zhu_Online_Multi-Object_Tracking_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ji Zhu, Hua Yang, Nian Liu, Minyoung Kim, Wenjun Zhang, Ming-Hsuan Yang
Dual-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Deformable Face Tracking	In this paper, we propose a dual-agent deep reinforcement learning (DADRL) method for deformable face tracking, which generates bounding boxes and detects facial landmarks interactively from face videos. Most existing deformable face tracking methods learn models for these two tasks individually, and perform these two procedures subsequently during the testing phase, which ignore the intrinsic connections of these two tasks. Motivated by the fact that the performance of facial landmark detection depends heavily on the accuracy of the generated bounding boxes, we exploit the interactions of these two tasks in probabilistic manner by following a Bayesian model and propose a unified framework for simultaneous bounding box tracking and landmark detection. By formulating it as a Markov decision process, we define two agents to exploit the relationships and pass messages via an adaptive sequence of actions under a deep reinforcement learning framework to iteratively adjust the positions of the bounding boxes and facial landmarks. Our proposed DADRL achieves performance improvements over the state-of-the-art deformable face tracking methods on the most challenging category of the 300-VW dataset.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Minghao_Guo_Dual-Agent_Deep_Reinforcement_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Minghao Guo, Jiwen Lu, Jie Zhou
Receptive Field Block Net for Accurate and Fast Object Detection	Current top-performing object detectors depend on deep CNN backbones, such as ResNet-101 and Inception, benefiting from their powerful feature representations but suffering from high computational costs. Conversely, some lightweight model based detectors fulfil real time processing, while their accuracies are often criticized. In this paper, we explore an alternative to build a fast and accurate detector by strengthening lightweight features using a hand-crafted mechanism. Inspired by the structure of Receptive Fields (RFs) in human visual systems, we propose a novel RF Block (RFB) module, which takes the relationship between the size and eccentricity of RFs into account, to enhance the feature discriminability and robustness. We further assemble RFB to the top of SSD, constructing the RFB Net detector. To evaluate its effectiveness, experiments are conducted on two major benchmarks and the results show that RFB Net is able to reach the performance of advanced very deep detectors while keeping the real-time speed. Code is available at https://github.com/ruinmessi/RFBNet.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Songtao_Liu_Receptive_Field_Block_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Songtao Liu, Di Huang, andYunhong Wang
Fighting Fake News: Image Splice Detection via Learned Self-Consistency	Advances in photo editing and manipulation tools have made it significantly easier to create fake imagery, highlighting the need for better visual forensics algorithms. However, learning to detect manipulations from labelled training data is difficult due to the lack of good datasets of manipulated visual content. In this paper, we introduce a self-supervised method for learning to detect a visual manipulations using only unlabeled data. Given a large collection of real photographs with automatically recorded EXIF meta-data, we train a model to determine whether an image is self-consistent -- that is, whether its content could have been produced by a single imaging pipeline. We apply this self-supervised learning method to the task of localizing spliced image content. Our forensics model achieves state of the art results on many benchmarks, despite being trained without examples of actual manipulations, and without modeling specific detection cues. Beyond handcrafted benchmarks, we also show promising results spotting fakes on Reddit and The Onion, as well as detecting computer-generated splices.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jacob_Huh_Fighting_Fake_News_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Minyoung Huh, Andrew Liu, Andrew Owens, Alexei A.

Local Spectral Graph Convolution for Point Set Feature Learning	Feature learning on point clouds has shown great promise, with the introduction of effective and generalizable deep learning frameworks such as pointnet++. Thus far, however, point features have been abstracted in an independent and isolated manner, ignoring the relative layout of neighboring points as well as their features. In the present article, we propose to overcome this limitation by using spectral graph convolution on a local graph, combined with a novel graph pooling strategy. In our approach, graph convolution is carried out on a nearest neighbor graph constructed from a point's neighborhood, such that features are jointly learned. We replace the standard max pooling step with a recursive clustering and pooling strategy, devised to aggregate information from within clusters of nodes that are close to one another in their spectral coordinates, leading to richer overall feature descriptors. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets, we show a consistent demonstrable advantage for the tasks of both point set classification and segmentation.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chu_Wang_Local_Spectral_Graph_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chu Wang, Babak Samari, Kaleem Siddiqi
Deep Domain Generalization via Conditional Invariant Adversarial Networks	Domain generalization aims to learn a classification model from multiple source domains and generalize it to unseen target domains. A critical problem in domain generalization involves learning domain-invariant representations. Let $X$ and $Y$ denote the features and the labels, respectively. Under the assumption that the conditional distribution $P(Y|X)$ remains unchanged across domains, earlier approaches to domain generalization learned the invariant representation $T(X)$ by minimizing the discrepancy of the marginal distribution $P(T(X))$. However, such an assumption of stable $P(Y|X)$ does not necessarily hold in practice. In addition, the representation learning function $T(X)$ is usually constrained to a simple linear transformation or shallow networks. To address the above two drawbacks, we propose an end-to-end conditional invariant deep domain generalization approach by leveraging deep neural networks for domain-invariant representation learning. The domain-invariance property is guaranteed through a conditional invariant adversarial network that can learn domain-invariant representations w.r.t. the joint distribution $P(T(X),Y)$ if the target domain data are not severely class unbalanced. We perform various experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ya_Li_Deep_Domain_Generalization_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ya Li, Xinmei Tian, Mingming Gong, Yajing Liu, Tongliang Liu, Kun Zhang, Dacheng Tao
Eigendecomposition-free Training of Deep Networks with Zero Eigenvalue-based Losses	Many classical Computer Vision problems, such as essential matrix computation and pose estimation from 3D to 2D correspondences, can be solved by finding the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest, or zero, eigenvalue of a matrix representing a linear system. Incorporating this in deep learning frameworks would allow us to explicitly encode known notions of geometry, instead of having the network implicitly learn them from data. However, performing eigendecomposition within a network requires the ability to differentiate this operation. Unfortunately, while theoretically doable, this introduces numerical instability in the optimization process in practice. In this paper, we introduce an eigendecomposition-free approach to training a deep network whose loss depends on the eigenvector corresponding to a zero eigenvalue of a matrix predicted by the network. We demonstrate on several tasks, including keypoint matching and 3D pose estimation, that our approach is much more robust than explicit differentiation of the eigendecomposition, It has better convergence properties and yields state-of-the-art results on both tasks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zheng_Dang_Eigendecomposition-free_Training_of_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zheng Dang, Kwang Moo Yi, Yinlin Hu, Fei Wang, Pascal Fua, Mathieu Salzmann
Visual Psychophysics for Making Face Recognition Algorithms More Explainable	Scientific fields that are interested in faces have developed their own sets of concepts and procedures for understanding how a target model system (be it a person or algorithm) perceives a face under varying conditions. In computer vision, this has largely been in the form of dataset evaluation for recognition tasks where summary statistics are used to measure progress. While aggregate performance has continued to improve, understanding individual causes of failure has been difficult, as it is not always clear why a particular face fails to be recognized, or why an impostor is recognized by an algorithm. Importantly, other fields studying vision have addressed this via the use of visual psychophysics: the controlled manipulation of stimuli and careful study of the responses they evoke in a model system. In this paper, we suggest that visual psychophysics is a viable methodology for making face recognition algorithms more explainable. A comprehensive set of procedures is developed for assessing face recognition algorithm behavior, which is then deployed over state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks and more basic, yet still widely used, shallow and handcrafted feature-based approaches.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Brandon_RichardWebster_Visual_Psychophysics_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Brandon RichardWebster, So Yon Kwon, Christopher Clarizio, Samuel E.

Learning to Look around Objects for Top-View Representations of Outdoor Scenes	Given a single RGB image of a complex outdoor road scene in the perspective view, we address the novel problem of estimating an occlusion-reasoned semantic scene layout in the top-view. This challenging problem not only requires an accurate understanding of both the 3D geometry and the semantics of the visible scene, but also of occluded areas. We propose a convolutional neural network that learns to predict occluded portions of the scene layout by looking around foreground objects like cars or pedestrians. But instead of hallucinating RGB values, we show that directly predicting the semantics and depths in the occluded areas enables a better transformation into the top-view. We further show that this initial top-view representation can be significantly enhanced by learning priors and rules about typical road layouts from simulated or, if available, map data. Crucially, training our model does not require costly or subjective human annotations for occluded areas or the top-view, but rather uses readily available annotations for standard semantic segmentation in the perspective view. We extensively evaluate and analyze our approach on the KITTI and Cityscapes data sets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Samuel_Schulter_Learning_to_Look_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Samuel Schulter, Menghua Zhai, Nathan Jacobs, Manmohan Chandraker
Adaptively Transforming Graph Matching	Recently, many graph matching methods that incorporate pairwise constraints and that can be formulated as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP) have been proposed. Although these methods demonstrate promising results for the graph matching problem, they have high complexity in space or time. In this paper, we introduce an adaptively transforming graph matching (ATGM) method from the perspective of functional representation. More precisely, under a transformation formulation, we aim to match two graphs by minimizing the discrepancy between the original graph and the transformed graph. With a linear representation map of the transformation, the pairwise edge attributes of graphs are explicitly represented by unary node attributes, which enables us to reduce the space and time complexity significantly. Due to an efficient Frank-Wolfe method-based optimization strategy, we can handle graphs with hundreds and thousands of nodes within an acceptable amount of time. Meanwhile, because transformation map can preserve graph structures, a domain adaptation-based strategy is proposed to remove the outliers.

WildDash - Creating Hazard-Aware Benchmarks	Test datasets should contain many different challenging aspects so that the robustness and real-world applicability of algorithms can be assessed. In this work, we present a new test dataset for semantic and instance segmentation for the automotive domain. We have conducted a thorough risk analysis to identify situations and aspects that can reduce the output performance for these tasks. Based on this analysis we have designed our new dataset. Meta-information is supplied to mark which individual visual hazards are present in each test case. Furthermore, a new benchmark evaluation method is presented that uses the meta-information to calculate the robustness of a given algorithm with respect to the individual hazards. We show how this new approach allows for a more expressive characterization of algorithm robustness by comparing three baseline algorithms.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Oliver_Zendel_WildDash_-_Creating_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Oliver Zendel, Katrin Honauer, Markus Murschitz, Daniel Steininger, Gustavo Fernandez Dominguez
3DMV: Joint 3D-Multi-View Prediction for 3D Semantic Scene Segmentation	We present 3DMV, a novel method for 3D semantic scene segmentation of RGB-D scans using a joint 3D-multi-view prediction network. In contrast to existing methods that either use geometry or RGB data as input for this task, we combine both data modalities in a joint, end-to-end network architecture. Rather than simply projecting color data into a volumetric grid and operating solely in 3D -- which would result in insufficient detail -- we first extract feature maps from associated RGB images. These features are then directly projected into the volumetric feature grid of a 3D network using a differentiable backprojection layer. Since our target is 3D scanning scenarios with possibly many frames, we use a multi-view pooling approach in order to handle a varying number of RGB input views. This learned combination of RGB and geometric features with our joint 2D-3D architecture achieves significantly better results than existing baselines. For instance, our final result on the ScanNet 3D segmentation benchmark increases from 52.8% to 75% accuracy compared to existing volumetric architectures.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Angela_Dai_3DMV_Joint_3D-Multi-View_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Angela Dai, Matthias Niessner
DYAN: A Dynamical Atoms-Based Network For Video Prediction	The ability to anticipate the future is essential when making real time critical decisions, provides valuable information to understand dynamic natural scenes, and can help unsupervised video representation learning. State-of-art video prediction is based on complex architectures that need to learn large numbers of parameters, are potentially hard to train, slow to run, and may produce blurry predictions. In this paper, we introduce DYAN, a novel network with very few parameters and easy to train, which produces accurate, high quality frame predictions, significantly faster than previous approaches. DYAN owes its good qualities to its encoder and decoder, which are designed following concepts from systems identification theory and exploit the dynamics-based invariants of the data. Extensive experiments using several standard video datasets show that DYAN is superior generating frames and that it generalizes well across domains.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Wenqian_Liu_DYAN_A_Dynamical_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Wenqian Liu, Abhishek Sharma, Octavia Camps, Mario Sznaier
Generalizing A Person Retrieval Model Hetero- and Homogeneously	Person re-identification (re-ID) poses unique challenges for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in that classes in the source and target sets (domains) are entirely different and that image variations are largely caused by cameras. Given a labeled source training set and an unlabeled target training set, we aim to improve the generalization ability of re-ID models on the target testing set. To this end, we introduce a Hetero-Homogeneous Learning (HHL) method. Our method enforces two properties simultaneously: 1) camera invariance, learned via positive pairs formed by unlabeled target images and their camera style transferred counterparts; 2) domain connectedness, by regarding source / target images as negative matching pairs to the target / source images. The first property is implemented by homogeneous learning because training pairs are collected from the same domain. The second property is achieved by heterogeneous learning because we sample training pairs from both the source and target domains. On Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03, we show that the two properties contribute indispensably and that very competitive re-ID UDA accuracy is achieved.

YouTube-VOS: Sequence-to-Sequence Video Object Segmentation	Learning long-term spatial-temporal features are critical for many video analysis tasks. However, existing video segmentation methods predominantly rely on static image segmentation techniques, and methods capturing temporal dependency for segmentation have to depend on pretrained optical flow models, leading to suboptimal solutions for the problem. End-to-end sequential learning to explore spatial-temporal features for video segmentation is largely limited by the scale of available video segmentation datasets, i.e., even the largest video segmentation dataset only contains 90 short video clips. To solve this problem, we build a new large-scale video object segmentation dataset called YouTube Video Object Segmentation dataset (YouTube-VOS). Our dataset contains 3,252 YouTube video clips and 78 categories including common objects and human activities. This is by far the largest video object segmentation dataset to our knowledge and we have released it at https://youtube-vos.org. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence network to fully exploit long-term spatial-temporal information in videos for segmentation. We demonstrate that our method is able to achieve the best results on our YouTube-VOS test set and comparable results on DAVIS 2016 compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. Experiments show that the large scale dataset is indeed a key factor to the success of our model.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ning_Xu_YouTube-VOS_Sequence-to-Sequence_Video_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ning Xu, Linjie Yang, Yuchen Fan, Jianchao Yang, Dingcheng Yue, Yuchen Liang, Brian Price, Scott Cohen, Thomas Huang
Multi-modal Cycle-consistent Generalized Zero-Shot Learning	In generalized zero shot learning (GZSL), the set of classes are split into seen and unseen classes, where training relies on the semantic features of the seen and unseen classes and the visual representations of only the seen classes, while testing uses the visual representations of the seen and unseen classes. Current methods address GZSL by learning a transformation from the visual to the semantic space, exploring the assumption that the distribution of classes in the semantic and visual spaces is relatively similar. Such methods tend to transform unseen testing visual representations into one of the seen classes' semantic features instead of the semantic features of the correct unseen class, resulting in low accuracy GZSL classification. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GAN) have been explored to synthesize visual representations of the unseen classes from their semantic features - the synthesized representations of the seen and unseen classes are then used to train the GZSL classifier. This approach has been shown to boost GZSL classification accuracy, but there is one important missing constraint: there is no guarantee that synthetic visual representations can generate back their semantic feature in a multi-modal cycle-consistent manner. This missing constraint can result in synthetic visual representations that do not represent well their semantic features, which means that the use of this constraint can improve GAN-based approaches. In this paper, we propose the use of such constraint based on a new regularization for the GAN training that forces the generated visual features to reconstruct their original semantic features. Once our model is trained with this multi-modal cycle-consistent semantically, we can then synthesize more representative visual features for the seen and, more importantly, for the unseen classes. Our proposed approach shows the best GZSL classification results in the field in several publicly available datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/RAFAEL_FELIX_Multi-modal_Cycle-consistent_Generalized_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Rafael Felix, Vijay Kumar B.

Does Haze Removal Help CNN-based Image Classification?	Hazy images are common in real scenarios and many dehazing methods have been developed to automatically remove the haze from images. Typically, the goal of image dehazing is to produce clearer images from which human vision can better identify the object and structural details present in the images. When the ground-truth haze-free image is available for a hazy image, quantitative evaluation of image dehazing is usually based on objective metrics, such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity (SSIM). However, in many applications, large-scale images are collected not for visual examination by human. Instead, they are used for many high-level vision tasks, such as automatic classification, recognition and categorization. One fundamental problem here is whether various dehazing methods can produce clearer images that can help improve the performance of the high-level tasks. In this paper, we empirically study this problem in the important task of image classification by using both synthetic and real hazy image datasets. From the experimental results, we find that the existing image-dehazing methods cannot improve much the image-classification performance and sometimes even reduce the image classification performance.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yanting_Pei_Does_Haze_Removal_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yanting Pei, Yaping Huang, Qi Zou, Yuhang Lu, Song Wang
Deep Feature Pyramid Reconfiguration for Object Detection	State-of-the-art object detectors usually learn multi-scale representations to get better results by employing feature pyramids. However, the current designs for feature pyramids are still inefficient to integrate the semantic information over different scales. In this paper, we begin by investigating current feature pyramids solutions, and then reformulate the feature pyramid construction as the feature reconfiguration process. Finally, we propose a novel reconfiguration architecture to combine low-level representations with high-level semantic features in a highly-nonlinear yet efficient way. In particular, our architecture which consists of global attention and local reconfigurations, is able to gather task-oriented features across different spatial locations and scales, globally and locally. Both the global attention and local reconfiguration are lightweight, in-place, and end-to-end trainable. Using this method in the basic SSD system, our models achieve consistent and significant boosts compared with the original model and its other variations, without losing real-time processing speed.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tao_Kong_Deep_Feature_Pyramid_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tao Kong, Fuchun Sun, Chuanqi Tan, Huaping Liu, Wenbing Huang
GridFace: Face Rectification via Learning Local Homography Transformations	In this paper, we propose a novel method, called GridFace, to reduce facial geometric variations and improve the recognition performance. Our method rectifies the face by local homography transformations, which are estimated by a face rectification network. To encourage the image generation with canonical views, we apply a regularization based on the natural face distribution. We learn the rectification network and recognition network in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments show our method greatly reduces geometric variations, and gains significant improvements in unconstrained face recognition scenarios.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhou_GridFace_Face_Rectification_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Erjin Zhou, Zhimin Cao, Jian Sun
Fully Motion-Aware Network for Video Object Detection	Video objection detection is challenging in the presence of appearance deterioration in certain video frames. One of typical solutions is to enhance per-frame features through aggregating neighboring frames. But the features of objects are usually not spatially calibrated across frames due to motion from object and camera. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model called fully motion-aware network (MANet), which jointly calibrates the features of objects on both pixel-level and instance-level in a unified framework. The pixel-level calibration is flexible in modeling detailed motion while the instance-level calibration captures more global motion cues in order to be robust to occlusion. To our best knowledge, MANet is the first work that can jointly train the two modules and dynamically combine them according to the motion patterns. It achieves leading performance on the large-scale ImageNet VID dataset.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Shiyao_Wang_Fully_Motion-Aware_Network_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Shiyao Wang, Yucong Zhou, Junjie Yan, Zhidong Deng
Learning Monocular Depth by Distilling Cross-domain Stereo Networks	Monocular depth estimation aims at estimating a pixelwise depth map for a single image, which has wide applications in scene understanding and autonomous driving. Existing supervised and unsupervised methods face great challenges. Supervised methods require large amounts of depth measurement data, which are generally difficult to obtain, while unsupervised methods are usually limited in estimation accuracy. Synthetic data generated by graphics engines provide a possible solution for collecting large amounts of depth data. However, the large domain gaps between synthetic and realistic data make directly training with them challenging. In this paper, we propose to use the stereo matching network as a proxy to learn depth from synthetic data and use predicted stereo disparity maps for supervising the monocular depth estimation network. Cross-domain synthetic data could be fully utilized in this novel framework. Different strategies are proposed to ensure learned depth perception capability well transferred across different domains. Our extensive experiments show state-of-the-art results of monocular depth estimation on KITTI dataset.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiaoyang_Guo_Learning_Monocular_Depth_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiaoyang Guo, Hongsheng Li, Shuai Yi, Jimmy Ren, Xiaogang Wang
RIDI: Robust IMU Double Integration	This paper proposes a novel data-driven approach for inertial navigation, which learns to estimate trajectories of natural human motions just from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) in every smartphone. The key observation is that human motions are repetitive and consist of a few major modes (e.g., standing, walking, or turning). Our algorithm regresses a velocity vector from the history of linear accelerations and angular velocities, then corrects low-frequency bias in the linear accelerations, which are integrated twice to estimate positions. We have acquired training data with ground-truth motions across multiple human subjects and multiple phone placements (e.g., in a bag or a hand-held). The qualitatively and quantitatively evaluations have demonstrated that our algorithm has surprisingly shown comparable results to full Visual Inertial navigation. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to integrate sophisticated machine learning techniques with inertial navigation, potentially opening up a new line of research in the domain of data-driven inertial navigation. We will publicly share our code and data to facilitate further research.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hang_Yan_RIDI_Robust_IMU_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hang Yan, Qi Shan, Yasutaka Furukawa
Self-Calibration of Cameras with Euclidean Image Plane in Case of Two Views and Known Relative Rotation Angle	The internal calibration of a pinhole camera is given by five parameters that are combined into an upper-triangular $3 imes 3$ calibration matrix. If the skew parameter is zero and the aspect ratio is equal to one, then the camera is said to have Euclidean image plane. In this paper, we propose a non-iterative self-calibration algorithm for a camera with Euclidean image plane in case the remaining three internal parameters --- the focal length and the principal point coordinates --- are fixed but unknown. The algorithm requires a set of $N geq 7$ point correspondences in two views and also the measured relative rotation angle between the views. We show that the problem generically has six solutions (including complex ones). The algorithm has been implemented and tested both on synthetic data and on publicly available real dataset. The experiments demonstrate that the method is correct, numerically stable and robust.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Martyushev_Self-Calibration_of_Cameras_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Evgeniy Martyushev
Self-produced Guidance for Weakly-supervised Object Localization	Weakly supervised methods usually generate localization results based on attention maps produced by classification networks. However, the attention maps exhibit the most discriminative parts of the object which are small and sparse. We propose to generate Self-produced Guidance (SPG) masks which separate the foreground, the object of interest, from the background to provide the classification networks with spatial correlation information of pixels. A stagewise approach is proposed to incorporate high confident object regions to learn the SPG masks. The high confident regions within attention maps are utilized to progressively learn the SPG masks. The masks are then used as an auxiliary pixel-level supervision to facilitate the training of classification networks. Extensive experiments on ILSVRC demonstrate that SPG is effective in producing high-quality object localizations maps. Particularly, the proposed SPG achieves the Top-1 localization error rate of 43.83% on the ILSVRC validation set, which is a new state-of-the-art error rate.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiaolin_Zhang_Self-produced_Guidance_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiaolin Zhang, Yunchao Wei, Guoliang Kang, Yi Yang, Thomas Huang
Skeleton-Based Action Recognition with Spatial Reasoning and Temporal Stack Learning	Skeleton-based action recognition has made great progress recently, but many problems still remain unsolved. For example, the representations of skeleton sequences captured by most of the previous methods lack spatial structure information and detailed temporal dynamics features. In this paper, we propose a novel model with spatial reasoning and temporal stack learning (SR-TSL) for skeleton-based action recognition, which consists of a spatial reasoning network (SRN) and a temporal stack learning network (TSLN). The SRN can capture the high-level spatial structural information within each frame by a residual graph neural network, while the TSLN can model the detailed temporal dynamics of skeleton sequences by a composition of multiple skip-clip LSTMs. During training, we propose a clip-based incremental loss to optimize the model. We perform extensive experiments on the SYSU 3D Human-Object Interaction dataset and NTU RGB+D dataset and verify the effectiveness of each network of our model. The comparison results illustrate that our approach achieves much better results than the state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chenyang_Si_Skeleton-Based_Action_Recognition_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chenyang Si, Ya Jing, Wei Wang, Liang Wang, Tieniu Tan
SRFeat: Single Image Super-Resolution with Feature Discrimination	Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have recently been adopted to single image super resolution (SISR) and showed impressive results with realistically synthesized high-frequency textures. However, the results of such GAN based approaches tend to include less meaningful high-frequency noise that is irrelevant to the input image. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based SISR method that overcomes the limitation and produces more realistic results by attaching an additional discriminator that works in the feature domain. Our additional discriminator encourages the generator to produce structural high-frequency features rather than noisy artifacts as it distinguishes synthetic and real images in terms of features. We also design a new generator that utilizes long-range skip connections so that information between distant layers can be transferred more effectively. Experiments show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in terms of both PSNR and perceptual quality compared to recent GAN-based methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Seong-Jin_Park_SRFeat_Single_Image_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Seong-Jin Park, Hyeongseok Son, Sunghyun Cho, Ki-Sang Hong, Seungyong Lee
Modular Generative Adversarial Networks	Existing methods for multi-domain image-to-image translation attempt to directly map inputs to outputs using a single model. However, these methods have limited scalability and robustness. Inspired by module networks, this paper propose ModularGAN for multi-domain image-to-image translation that consists of several reusable and compatible modules of different functions. These modules can be trained simultaneously, and chosen and combined with each other to construct specific networks according to the domains of the image translation task involves. This leads to ModularGAN's superior flexibility of translating an input image to any desired domain. Experimental results demonstrate that our model not only presents compelling perceptual results but also outperform state-of-the-art results on multi-domain facial attribute transfer task.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Bo_Zhao_Modular_Generative_Adversarial_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Bo Zhao, Bo Chang, Zequn Jie, Leonid Sigal
A Geometric Perspective on Structured Light Coding	We present a mathematical framework for analysis and design of high performance structured light (SL) coding schemes. Using this framework, we design Hamiltonian SL coding, a novel family of SL coding schemes that can recover 3D shape with extreme precision, with a small number (as few as three) of images. We establish structural similarity between popular discrete (binary) SL coding methods, and Hamiltonian coding, which is a continuous coding approach. Based on this similarity, and by leveraging design principles from several different SL coding families, we propose a general recipe for designing Hamiltonian coding patterns with specific desirable properties, such as patterns with high spatial frequencies for dealing with global illumination. We perform several experiments to evaluate the proposed approach, and demonstrate that Hamiltonian coding based SL approaches outperform existing methods in challenging scenarios, including scenes with dark albedos, strong ambient light, and interreflections.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Mohit_Gupta_A_Geometric_Perspective_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Mohit Gupta, Nikhil Nakhate
Geometric Constrained Joint Lane Segmentation and Lane Boundary Detection	Lane detection is playing an indispensable role in advanced driver assistance systems. The existing approaches for lane detection can be categorized as lane area segmentation and lane boundary detection. Most of these methods abandon a great quantity of complementary information, such as geometric priors, when exploiting the lane area and the lane boundaries alternatively. In this paper, we establish a multiple-task learning framework to segment lane areas and detect lane boundaries simultaneously. The main contributions of the proposed frame- work are highlighted in two facets: (1) We put forward a multiple-task learning framework with mutually interlinked sub-structures between lane segmentation and lane boundary detection to improve overall performance. (2) A novel loss function is proposed with two geometric constraints considered, as assumed that the lane boundary is predicted as the outer contour of the lane area while the lane area is predicted as the area integration result within the lane boundary lines. With an end-to-end training process, these improvements extremely enhance the robustness and accuracy of our approach on several metrics. The proposed framework is evaluated on KITTI dataset, CULane dataset and RVD dataset. Compared with the state of the arts, our approach achieves the best performance on the metrics and a more robust detection in varied traffic scenes.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jie_Zhang_Geometric_Constrained_Joint_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jie Zhang, Yi Xu, Bingbing Ni, Zhenyu Duan
Adversarial Open-World Person Re-Identification	In a typical real-world application of re-id, a watch-list (gallery set) of a handful of target people (e.g. suspects) to track around a large volume of non-target people are demanded across camera views, and this is called the open-world person re-id. Different from conventional (closed-world) person re-id, a large portion of probe samples are not from target people in the open-world setting. And, it always happens that a non-target person would look similar to a target one and therefore would seriously challenge a re-id system. In this work, we introduce a deep open-world group-based person re-id model based on adversarial learning to alleviate the attack problem caused by similar non-target people. The main idea is learning to attack feature extractor on the target people by using GAN to generate very target-like images (imposters), and in the meantime the model will make the feature extractor learn to tolerate the attack by discriminative learning so as to realize group-based verification. The framework we proposed is called the adversarial open-world person re-identification, and this is realized by our Adversarial PersonNet (APN) that jointly learns a generator, a person discriminator, a target discriminator and a feature extractor, where the feature extractor and target discriminator share the same weights so as to makes the feature extractor learn to tolerate the attack by imposters for better group-based verification. While open-world person re-id is challenging, we show for the first time that the adversarial-based approach helps stabilize person re-id system under imposter attack more effectively.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiang_Li_Adversarial_Open-World_Person_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiang Li, Ancong Wu, Wei-Shi Zheng
Video Re-localization	Many methods have been developed to help people find the video content they want efficiently. However, there are still some unsolved problems in this area. For example, given a query video and a reference video, how to accurately localize a segment in the reference video such that the segment semantically corresponds to the query video? We define a distinctively new task, namely extbf{video re-localization}, to address this need. Video re-localization is an important enabling technology with many applications, such as fast seeking in videos, video copy detection, as well as video surveillance. Meanwhile, it is also a challenging research task because the visual appearance of a semantic concept in videos can have large variations. The first hurdle to clear for the video re-localization task is the lack of existing datasets. It is labor expensive to collect pairs of videos with semantic coherence or correspondence, and label the corresponding segments. We first exploit and reorganize the videos in ActivityNet to form a new dataset for video re-localization research, which consists of about 10,000 videos of diverse visual appearances associated with the localized boundary information. Subsequently, we propose an innovative cross gated bilinear matching model such that every time-step in the reference video is matched against the attentively weighted query video. Consequently, the prediction of the starting and ending time is formulated as a classification problem based on the matching results. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yang_Feng_Video_Re-localization_via_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yang Feng, Lin Ma, Wei Liu, Tong Zhang, Jiebo Luo
Probabilistic Video Generation using Holistic Attribute Control	Videos express highly structured spatio-temporal patterns of visual data. A video can be thought of as being governed by two factors: (i) temporally invariant (e.g., person identity), or slowly varying (e.g., activity), attribute-induced appearance, encoding the persistent content of each frame, and (ii) an inter-frame motion or scene dynamics (e.g., encoding evolution of the person executing the action). Based on this intuition, we propose a generative framework for video generation and future prediction. The proposed framework generates a video (short clip) by decoding samples sequentially drawn from a latent space distribution into full video frames. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are used as a means of encoding/decoding frames into/from the latent space and RNN as a way to model the dynamics in the latent space. We improve the video generation consistency through temporally-conditional sampling and quality by structuring the latent space with attribute controls; ensuring that attributes can be both inferred and conditioned on during learning/generation. As a result, given attributes and/or the first frame, our model is able to generate diverse but highly consistent sets of video sequences, accounting for the inherent uncertainty in the prediction task. Experimental results on three challenging datasets, along with detailed comparison to the state-of-the-art, verify effectiveness of the framework.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jiawei_He_Probabilistic_Video_Generation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jiawei He, Andreas Lehrmann, Joseph Marino, Greg Mori, Leonid Sigal
DDRNet: Depth Map Denoising and Refinement for Consumer Depth Cameras Using Cascaded CNNs	Consumer depth sensors are more and more popular and come to our daily lives marked by its recent integration in the latest Iphone X. However, they still suffer from heavy noises which limit their applications. Although plenty of progresses have been made to reduce the noises and boost geometric details, due to the inherent illness and the real-time requirement, the problem is still far from been solved. We propose a cascaded Depth Denoising and Refinement Network (DDRNet) to tackle this problem by leveraging the multi-frame fused geometry and the accompanying high quality color image through a joint training strategy. The rendering equation is exploited in our network in an unsupervised manner. In detail, we impose an unsupervised loss based on the light transport to extract the high-frequency geometry. Experimental results indicate that our network achieves real-time single depth enhancement on various categories of scenes. Thanks to the well decoupling of the low and high frequency information in the cascaded network, we achieve superior performance over the state-of-the-art techniques.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Shi_Yan_DDRNet_Depth_Map_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Shi Yan, Chenglei Wu, Lizhen Wang, Feng Xu, Liang An, Kaiwen Guo, Yebin Liu
Seeing Tree Structure from Vibration	Humans recognize object structure from both their appearance and motion; often, motion helps to resolve ambiguities in object structure that arise when we observe object appearance only. There are particular scenarios, however, where neither appearance nor spatial-temporal motion signals are informative: occluding twigs may look connected and have almost identical movements, though they belong to different, possibly disconnected branches. We propose to tackle this problem through spectrum analysis of motion signals, because vibrations of disconnected branches, though visually similar, often have distinctive natural frequencies. We propose a novel formulation of tree structure based on a physics-based link model, and validate its effectiveness by theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and empirical experiments. With this formulation, we use nonparametric Bayesian inference to reconstruct tree structure from both spectral vibration signals and appearance cues. Our model performs well in recognizing hierarchical tree structure from real-world videos of trees and vessels.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tianfan_Xue_Seeing_Tree_Structure_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tianfan Xue, Jiajun Wu, Zhoutong Zhang, Chengkai Zhang, Joshua B.

Multiresolution Tree Networks for 3D Point Cloud Processing	We present multiresolution tree-structured networks to process point clouds for 3D shape understanding and generation tasks. Our network represents a 3D shape as set of locality-preserving 1D ordered list of points at multiple resolutions. This allows efficient feed-forward processing through 1D convolutions, coarse-to-fine analysis through a multi-grid architecture, and it leads to faster convergence and small memory footprint during training. The proposed tree-structured encoders can be used to classify shapes and outperform existing point-based architectures on shape classification benchmarks, while tree-structured decoders can be used for generating point clouds directly and they outperform existing approaches for image-to-shape inference tasks learned using the ShapeNet dataset. Our model also allows unsupervised learning of point-cloud based shapes by using a variational autoencoder, leading to higher-quality generated shapes.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Matheus_Gadelha_Multiresolution_Tree_Networks_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Matheus Gadelha, Rui Wang, Subhransu Maji
Visual Reasoning with Multi-hop Feature Modulation	Recent breakthroughs in computer vision and natural language processing have spurred interest in challenging multi-modal tasks such as visual question-answering and visual dialogue. For such tasks, one successful approach is to condition image-based convolutional network computation on language via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layers, i.e., per-channel scaling and shifting. By alternating between attending to the language input and generating FiLM layer parameters, this approach is better able to scale to settings with longer input sequences such as dialogue. We demonstrate that multi-hop FiLM generation significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art on the GuessWhat?! visual dialogue task and matches state-of-the art on the ReferIt object retrieval task, and we provide additional qualitative analysis.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Florian_Strub_Visual_Reasoning_with_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Florian Strub, Mathieu Seurin, Ethan Perez, Harm de Vries, Jeremie Mary, Philippe Preux, Aaron CourvilleOlivier Pietquin
BSN: Boundary Sensitive Network for Temporal Action Proposal Generation	"Temporal action proposal generation is an important yet challenging problem, since temporal proposals with rich action content are indispensable for analysing real-world videos with long duration and high proportion irrelevant content. This problem requires methods not only generating proposals with precise temporal boundaries, but also retrieving proposals to cover truth action instances with high recall and high overlap using relatively fewer proposals. To address these difficulties, we introduce an effective proposal generation method, named Boundary-Sensitive Network (BSN), which adopts ""local to global"" fashion. Locally, BSN first locates temporal boundaries with high probabilities, then directly combines these boundaries as proposals. Globally, with Boundary-Sensitive Proposal feature, BSN retrieves proposals by evaluating the confidence of whether a proposal contains an action within its region. We conduct experiments on two challenging datasets: ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS14, where BSN outperforms other state-of-the-art temporal action proposal generation methods with high recall and high temporal precision. Finally, further experiments demonstrate that by combining existing action classifiers, our method significantly improves the state-of-the-art temporal action detection performance."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tianwei_Lin_BSN_Boundary_Sensitive_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tianwei Lin, Xu Zhao, Haisheng Su, Chongjing Wang, Ming Yang
Learning with Biased Complementary Labels	In this paper, we study the classification problem in which we have access to easily obtainable surrogate for true labels, namely complementary labels, which specify classes that observations do extbf{not} belong to. Let $Y$ and $ar{Y}$ be the true and complementary labels, respectively. We first model the annotation of complementary labels via transition probabilities $P(ar{Y}=i|Y=j), i eq jin{1,cdots,c}$, where $c$ is the number of classes. Previous methods implicitly assume that $P(ar{Y}=i|Y=j), forall i eq j$, are identical, which is not true in practice because humans are biased toward their own experience. For example, as shown in Figure ef{complementary_label_cases}, if an annotator is more familiar with monkeys than prairie dogs when providing complementary labels for meerkats, she is more likely to employ ``monkey'' as a complementary label. We therefore reason that the transition probabilities will be different. In this paper, we propose a framework that contributes three main innovations to learning with extbf{biased} complementary labels: (1) It estimates transition probabilities with no bias. (2) It provides a general method to modify traditional loss functions and extends standard deep neural network classifiers to learn with biased complementary labels. (3) It theoretically ensures that the classifier learned with complementary labels converges to the optimal one learned with true labels. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our method to current state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiyu_Yu_Learning_with_Biased_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiyu Yu, Tongliang Liu, Mingming Gong, Dacheng Tao
Deep Regionlets for Object Detection	"In this paper, we propose a novel object detection framework named ""Deep Regionlets"" by establishing a bridge between deep neural networks and conventional detection schema for accurate generic object detection. Motivated by the abilities of regionlets for modeling object deformation and multiple aspect ratios, we incorporate regionlets into an end-to-end trainable deep learning framework. The deep regionlets framework consists of a region selection network and a deep regionlet learning module. Specifically, given a detection bounding box proposal, the region selection network provides guidance on where to select regions to learn the features from. The regionlet learning module focuses on local feature selection and transformation to alleviate local variations. To this end, we first realize non-rectangular region selection within the detection framework to accommodate variations in object appearance. Moreover, we design a ``gating network"" within the regionlet leaning module to enable soft regionlet selection and pooling. The Deep Regionlets framework is trained end-to-end without additional efforts. We perform ablation studies and conduct extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and Microsoft COCO datasets. The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, such as RetinaNet and Mask R-CNN, even without additional segmentation labels."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hongyu_Xu_Deep_Regionlets_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hongyu Xu, Xutao Lv, Xiaoyu Wang, Zhou Ren, Navaneeth Bodla, Rama Chellappa
Pose Proposal Networks	We propose a novel method to detect an unknown number of articulated 2D poses in real time. To decouple the runtime complexity of pixel-wise body part detectors from their convolutional neural network (CNN) feature map resolutions, our approach, called pose proposal networks, introduces a state-of-the-art single-shot object detection paradigm using grid-wise image feature maps in a bottom-up pose detection scenario. Body part proposals, which are represented as region proposals, and limbs are detected directly via a single-shot CNN. Specialized to such detections, a bottom-up greedy parsing step is probabilistically redesigned to take into account the global context. Experimental results on the MPII Multi-Person benchmark confirm that our method achieves 72.8% mAP comparable to state-of-the-art bottom-up approaches while its total runtime using a GeForce GTX1080Ti card reaches up to 5.6 ms (180 FPS), which exceeds the bottleneck runtimes that are observed in state-of-the-art approaches.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Sekii_Pose_Proposal_Networks_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Taiki Sekii
DeepJDOT: Deep Joint Distribution Optimal Transport for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation	In computer vision, one is often confronted with problems of domain shifts, which occur when one applies a classifier trained on a source dataset to target data sharing similar characteristics (e.g. same classes), but also different latent data structures (e.g. different acquisition conditions). In such a situation, the model will perform poorly on the new data, since the classifier is specialized to recognize visual cues specific to the source domain. In this work we explore a solution, named DeepJDOT, to tackle this problem: through a measure of discrepancy on joint deep representations/labels based on optimal transport, we not only learn new data representations aligned between the source and target domain, but also simultaneously preserve the discriminative information used by the classifier. We applied DeepJDOT to a series of visual recognition tasks, where it compares favorably against state-of-the-art deep domain adaptation methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Bharath_Bhushan_Damodaran_DeepJDOT_Deep_Joint_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Bharath Bhushan Damodaran, Benjamin Kellenberger, Remi Flamary, Devis Tuia, Nicolas Courty
Learning-based Video Motion Magnification	Video motion magnification techniques allow us to see small motions previously invisible to the naked eyes, such as those of vibrating airplane wings, or swaying buildings under the influence of the wind. Because the motion is small, the magnification results are prone to noise or excessive blurring. The state of the art relies on hand-designed filters to extract representations that may not be optimal. In this paper, we seek to learn the filters directly from examples using deep convolutional neural networks. To make training tractable, we carefully design a synthetic dataset that captures small motion well, and use two-frame input for training. We show that the learned filters achieve high-quality results on real videos, with less ringing artifacts and better noise characteristics than previous methods. While our model is not trained with temporal filters, we found that the temporal filters can be used with our extracted representations up to a moderate magnification, enabling a frequency-based motion selection. Finally, we analyze the learned filters and show that they behave similarly to the derivative filters used in previous works. Our code, trained model, and datasets will be available online.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tae-Hyun_Oh_Learning-based_Video_Motion_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tae-Hyun Oh, Ronnachai Jaroensri, Changil Kim, Mohamed Elgharib, Fr'edo Durand, William T.

Deep Model-Based 6D Pose Refinement in RGB	We present a novel approach for model-based 6D pose refinement in color data. Building on the established idea of contour-based pose tracking, we teach a deep neural network to predict a translational and rotational update. At the core, we propose a new visual loss that drives the pose update by aligning object contours, thus avoiding the definition of any explicit appearance model. In contrast to previous work our method is correspondence-free, segmentation-free, can handle occlusion and is agnostic to geometrical symmetry as well as visual ambiguities. Additionally, we observe a strong robustness towards rough initialization. The approach can run in real-time and produces pose accuracies that come close to 3D ICP without the need for depth data. Furthermore, our networks are trained from purely synthetic data and will be published together with the refinement code to ensure reproducibility.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Fabian_Manhardt_Deep_Model-Based_6D_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Fabian Manhardt, Wadim Kehl, Nassir Navab, Federico Tombari
Single Image Intrinsic Decomposition without a Single Intrinsic Image	Intrinsic image decomposition---decomposing a natural image into a set of images corresponding to different physical causes---is one of the key and fundamental problems of computer vision. Previous intrinsic decomposition approaches either address the problem in a fully supervised manner, or require multiple images of the same scene as input. These approaches are less desirable in practice, as ground truth intrinsic images are extremely difficult to acquire, and requirement of multiple images pose severe limitation on applicable scenarios. In this paper, we propose to bring the best of both worlds. We present a two stream convolutional neural network framework that is capable of learning the decomposition effectively in the absence of any ground truth intrinsic images, and can be easily extended to a (semi-)supervised setup. At inference time, our model can be easily reduced to a single stream module that performs intrinsic decomposition on a single input image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive experimental study on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing superior performance over previous approaches in both single-image and multi-image settings. Notably, our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art single image methods while using only 50% of ground truth supervision.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Wei-Chiu_Single_Image_Intrinsic_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Wei-Chiu Ma, Hang Chu, Bolei Zhou, Raquel Urtasun, Antonio Torralba
Deep Virtual Stereo Odometry: Leveraging Deep Depth Prediction for Monocular Direct Sparse Odometry	Monocular visual odometry approaches that purely rely on geometric cues are prone to scale drift and require sufficient motion parallax in successive frames for motion estimation and 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we propose to leverage deep monocular depth prediction to overcome limitations of geometry-based monocular visual odometry. To this end, we incorporate deep depth predictions into Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO) as direct virtual stereo measurements. For depth prediction, we design a novel deep network that refines predicted depth from a single image in a two-stage process. We train our network in a semi-supervised way on photoconsistency in stereo images and on consistency with accurate sparse depth reconstructions from Stereo DSO. Our deep predictions excel state-of-the-art approaches for monocular depth on the KITTI benchmark. Moreover, our Deep Virtual Stereo Odometry clearly exceeds previous monocular and deep-learning based methods in accuracy. It even achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art stereo methods, while only relying on a single camera.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Nan_Yang_Deep_Virtual_Stereo_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Nan Yang, Rui Wang, Jorg Stuckler, Daniel Cremers
3D-CODED: 3D Correspondences by Deep Deformation	We present a new deep learning approach for matching deformable shapes by introducing Shape Deformation Networks which jointly encode 3D shapes and correspondences. This is achieved by factoring the surface representation into (i) a template, that parameterizes the surface, and (ii) a learnt global feature vector that parameterizes the transformation of the template into the input surface. By predicting this feature for a new shape, we implicitly predict correspondences between this shape and the template. We show that these correspondences can be improved by an additional step which improves the shape feature by minimizing the Chamfer distance between the input and transformed template. We demonstrate that our simple approach improves on state-of-the-art results on the difficult FAUST-inter challenge, with an average correspondence error of 2.88cm. We show, on the TOSCA dataset, that our method is robust to many types of perturbations, and generalizes to non-human shapes. This robustness allows it to perform well on real unclean, meshes from the the SCAPE dataset.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Thibault_Groueix_Shape_correspondences_from_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Thibault Groueix, Matthew Fisher, Vladimir G.

SegStereo: Exploiting Semantic Information for Disparity Estimation	Disparity estimation for binocular stereo images finds a wide range of applications. Traditional algorithms may fail on featureless regions, which could be handled by high-level clues such as semantic segments. In this paper, we suggest that appropriate incorporation of semantic cues can greatly rectify prediction in commonly-used disparity estimation frameworks. Our method conducts semantic feature embedding and regularizes semantic cues as the loss term to improve learning disparity. Our unified model SegStereo employs semantic features from segmentation and introduces semantic softmax loss, which helps improve the prediction accuracy of disparity maps. The semantic cues work well in both unsupervised and supervised manners. SegStereo achieves state-of-the-art results on KITTI Stereo benchmark and produces decent prediction on both CityScapes and FlyingThings3D datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Guorun_Yang_SegStereo_Exploiting_Semantic_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Guorun Yang, Hengshuang Zhao, Jianping Shi, Zhidong Deng, Jiaya Jia
Simultaneous 3D Reconstruction for Water Surface and Underwater Scene	This paper presents the first approach for simultaneously recovering the 3D shape of both the wavy water surface and the moving underwater scene. A portable camera array system is constructed, which captures the scene from multiple viewpoints above the water. The correspondences across these cameras are estimated using an optical flow method and are used to infer the shape of the water surface and the underwater scene. We assume that there is only one refraction occurring at the water interface. Under this assumption, two estimates of the water surface normals should agree: one from Snell's law of light refraction and another from local surface structure. The experimental results using both synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented approach.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yiming_Qian_Simultaneous_3D_Reconstruction_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yiming Qian, Yinqiang Zheng, Minglun Gong, Yee-Hong Yang
Concept Mask: Large-Scale Segmentation from Semantic Concepts	Existing works on semantic segmentation typically consider a small number of labels, ranging from tens to a few hundreds. With a large number of labels, training and evaluation of such task become extremely challenging due to correlation between labels and lack of datasets with complete annotations. We formulate semantic segmentation as a problem of image segmentation given a semantic concept, and propose a novel system which can potentially handle an unlimited number of concepts, including objects, parts, stuff, and attributes. We achieve this using a weakly and semi-supervised framework leveraging multiple datasets with different levels of supervision. We first train a deep neural network on a 6M stock image dataset with only image-level labels to learn visual-semantic embedding on 18K concepts. Then, we refine and extend the embedding network to predict an attention map, using a curated dataset with bounding box annotations on 750 concepts. Finally, we train an attention-driven class agnostic segmentation network using an 80-category fully annotated dataset. We perform extensive experiments to validate that the proposed system performs competitively to the state of the art on fully supervised concepts, and is capable of producing accurate segmentations for weakly learned and unseen concepts.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yufei_Wang_ConceptMask_Large-Scale_Segmentation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yufei Wang, Zhe Lin, Xiaohui Shen, Jianming Zhang, Scott Cohen
TrackingNet: A Large-Scale Dataset and Benchmark for Object Tracking in the Wild	Despite the numerous developments in object tracking, further development of current tracking algorithms is limited by small and mostly saturated datasets. As a matter of fact, data-hungry trackers based on deep-learning currently rely on object detection datasets due to the scarcity of dedicated large-scale tracking datasets. In this work, we present TrackingNet, the first large-scale dataset and benchmark for object tracking in the wild. We provide more than 30K videos with more than 14 million dense bounding box annotations. Our dataset covers a wide selection of object classes in broad and diverse context. By releasing such a large-scale dataset, we expect deep trackers to further improve and generalize. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark composed of 500 novel videos, modeled with a distribution similar to our training dataset. By sequestering the annotation of the test set and providing an online evaluation server, we provide a fair benchmark for future development of object trackers. Deep trackers fine-tuned on a fraction of our dataset improve their performance by up to 1.6% on OTB100 and up to 1.7% on TrackingNet Test. We provide an extensive benchmark on TrackingNet by evaluating more than 20 trackers. Our results suggest that object tracking in the wild is far from being solved.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Matthias_Muller_TrackingNet_A_Large-Scale_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Matthias Muller, Adel Bibi, Silvio Giancola, Salman Alsubaihi, Bernard Ghanem
Interactive Boundary Prediction for Object Selection	Interactive image segmentation is critical for many image editing tasks. While recent advanced methods on interactive segmentation focus on the region-based paradigm, more traditional boundary-based methods such as Intelligent Scissor are still popular in practice as they allow users to have active control of the object boundaries. Existing methods for boundary-based segmentation solely rely on low-level image features, such as edges for boundary extraction, which limits their ability to adapt to high-level image content and user intention. In this paper, we introduce an interaction-aware method for boundary-based image segmentation. Instead of relying on pre-defined low-level image features, our method adaptively predicts object boundaries according to image content and user interactions. Therein, we develop a fully convolutional encoder-decoder network that takes both the image and user interactions (e.g. clicks on boundary points) as input and predicts semantically meaningful boundaries that match user intentions. Our method explicitly models the dependency of boundary extraction results on image content and user interactions. Experiments on two public interactive segmentation benchmarks show that our method significantly improves the boundary quality of segmentation results compared to state-of-the-art methods while requiring fewer user interactions.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hoang_Le_Interactive_Boundary_Prediction_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hoang Le, Long Mai, Brian Price, Scott Cohen, Hailin Jin, Feng Liu
An Adversarial Approach to Hard Triplet Generation	While deep neural networks have demonstrated competitive results for many visual recognition and image retrieval tasks, the major challenge lies in distinguishing similar images from different categories (i.e., hard negative examples) while clustering images with large variations from the same category (i.e., hard positive examples). The current state-of-the-art is to mine the most hard triplet examples from the mini-batch to train the network. However, mining-based methods tend to look into these triplets that are hard in terms of the current estimated network, rather than deliberately generating those hard triplets that really matter in globally optimizing the network. For this purpose, we propose an adversarial network for Hard Triplet Generation (HTG) to optimize the network ability in distinguishing similar examples of different categories as well as grouping varied examples of the same categories. We evaluate our method on the real-world challenging datasets, such as CUB200-2011, CARS196, DeepFashion and VehicleID datasets, and show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yiru_Zhao_A_Principled_Approach_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yiru Zhao, Zhongming Jin, Guo-jun Qi, Hongtao Lu, Xian-sheng Hua
What do I Annotate Next? An Empirical Study of Active Learning for Action Localization	Despite tremendous progress achieved in temporal action localization, state-of-the-art methods still struggle to train accurate models when annotated data is scarce. In this paper, we introduce a novel active learning framework for temporal localization that aims to mitigate this data dependency issue. We equip our framework with active selection functions that can reuse knowledge from previously annotated datasets. We study the performance of two state-of-the-art active selection functions as well as two widely used active learning baselines. To validate the effectiveness of each one of these selection functions, we conduct simulated experiments on ActivityNet. We find that using previously acquired knowledge as a bootstrapping source is crucial for active learners aiming to localize actions. When equipped with the right selection function, our proposed framework exhibits significantly better performance than standard active learning strategies, such as uncertainty sampling. Finally, we employ our framework to augment the newly compiled Kinetics action dataset with ground-truth temporal annotations. As a result, we collect Kinetics-Localization, a novel large-scale dataset for temporal action localization, which contains more than 15K YouTube videos.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Fabian_Caba_What_do_I_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Fabian Caba Heilbron, Joon-Young Lee, Hailin Jin, Bernard Ghanem
Verisimilar Image Synthesis for Accurate Detection and Recognition of Texts in Scenes	"The requirement of large amounts of annotated images has become one grand challenge while training deep neural network models for various visual detection and recognition tasks. This paper presents a novel image synthesis technique that aims to generate a large amount of annotated scene text images for training accurate and robust scene text detection and recognition models. The proposed technique consists of three innovative designs. First, it realizes ""semantic coherent"" synthesis by embedding texts at semantically sensible regions within the background image, where the semantic coherence is achieved by leveraging the semantic annotations of objects and image regions that have been created in the prior semantic segmentation research. Second, it exploits visual saliency to determine the embedding locations within each semantic sensible region, which coincides with the fact that texts are often placed around homogeneous regions for better visibility in scenes. Third, it designs an adaptive text appearance model that determines the color and brightness of embedded texts by learning from the feature of real scene text images adaptively. The proposed technique has been evaluated over five public datasets and the experiments show its superior performance in training accurate and robust scene text detection and recognition models."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Fangneng_Zhan_Verisimilar_Image_Synthesis_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Fangneng Zhan, Shijian Lu, Chuhui Xue
TBN: Convolutional Neural Network with Ternary Inputs and Binary Weights	Despite the remarkable success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on generalized visual tasks, high computational and memory costs restrict their comprehensive applications on consumer electronics (e.g., portable or smart wearable devices). Recent advancements in binarized networks have demonstrated progress on reducing computational and memory costs, however, they suffer from significant performance degradation comparing to their full-precision counterparts. Thus, a highly-economical yet effective CNN that is authentically applicable to consumer electronics is at urgent need. In this work, we propose a Ternary-Binary Network (TBN), which provides an efficient approximation to standard CNNs. Based on an accelerated ternary-binary matrix multiplication, TBN replaces the arithmetical operations in standard CNNs with efficient XOR, AND and bitcount operations, and thus provides an optimal tradeoff between memory, efficiency and performance. TBN demonstrates its consistent effectiveness when applied to various CNN architectures (e.g., AlexNet and ResNet) on multiple datasets of different scales, and provides ~32x memory savings and 40x faster convolutional operations. Meanwhile, TBN can outperform XNOR-Network by up to 5.5% (top-1 accuracy) on the ImageNet classification task, and up to 4.4% (mAP score) on the PASCAL VOC object detection task.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Diwen_Wan_TBN_Convolutional_Neural_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Diwen Wan, Fumin Shen, Li Liu, Fan Zhu, Jie Qin, Ling Shao, Heng Tao Shen
Semi-supervised Adversarial Learning to Generate Photorealistic Face Images of New Identities from 3D Morphable Model	We propose a novel end-to-end semi-supervised adversarial framework to generate photorealistic face images of new identities with a wide range of expressions, poses, and illuminations conditioned by synthetic images sampled from a 3D morphable model. Previous adversarial style-transfer methods either supervise their networks with a large volume of paired data or train highly under-constrained two-way generative networks in an unsupervised fashion. We propose a semi-supervised adversarial learning framework to constrain the two-way networks by a small number of paired real and synthetic images, along with a large volume of unpaired data. A set-based loss is also proposed to preserve identity coherence of generated images. Qualitative results show that generated face images of new identities contain pose, lighting and expression diversity. They are also highly constrained by the synthetic input images while adding photorealism and retaining identity information. We combine face images generated by the proposed method with a real data set to train face recognition algorithms and evaluate the model quantitatively on two challenging data sets: LFW and IJB-A. The generated images by our framework consistently improve the performance of deep face recognition networks trained with the Oxford VGG Face dataset, and achieve comparable results to the state-of-the-art.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Baris_Gecer_Semi-supervised_Adversarial_Learning_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Baris Gecer, Binod Bhattarai, Josef Kittler, Tae-Kyun Kim
Explainable Neural Computation via Stack Neural Module Networks	In complex inferential tasks like question answering, machine learning models must confront two challenges: the need to implement a compositional reasoning process, and, in many applications, the need for this reasoning process to be interpretable to assist users in both development and prediction. Existing models designed to produce interpretable traces of their decision-making process typically require these traces to be supervised at training time. In this paper, we present a novel neural modular approach that performs compositional reasoning by automatically inducing a desired sub-task decomposition without relying on strong supervision. Our model allows linking different reasoning tasks though shared modules that handle common routines across tasks. Experiments show that the model is more interpretable to human evaluators compared to other state-of-the-art models: users can better understand the model's underlying reasoning procedure and predict when it will succeed or fail based on observing its intermediate outputs.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ronghang_Hu_Explainable_Neural_Computation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ronghang Hu, Jacob Andreas, Trevor Darrell, Kate Saenko
Value-aware Quantization for Training and Inference of Neural Networks	We propose a novel value-aware quantization which applies aggressively reduced precision to the majority of data while separately handling a small amount of large data in high precision, which reduces total quantization errors under very low precision. We present new techniques to apply the proposed quantization to training and inference. The experiments show that our method with 3-bit activations (with 2% of large ones) can give the same training accuracy as full-precision one while offering significant (41.6% and 53.7%) reductions in the memory cost of activations in ResNet-152 and Inception-v3 compared with the state-of-the-art method. Our experiments also show that deep networks such as Inception-v3, ResNet-101 and DenseNet-121 can be quantized for inference with 4-bit weights and activations (with 1% 16-bit data) within 1% top-1 accuracy drop.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Eunhyeok_Park_Value-aware_Quantization_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Eunhyeok Park, Sungjoo Yoo, Peter Vajda
Stereo Computation for a Single Mixture Image	This paper proposes an original problem of emph{stereo computation from a single (additive) mixture image}-- a challenging problem that had not been researched before. The goal is to separate (ie unmix) a single mixture image into two constitute image layers, such that the two layers form a left-right stereo image pair, from which a valid disparity map can be recovered. This is a severely illposed problem, from one input image one effectively aims to recover three (ie, left image, right image and a disparity map). In this work we give a novel deep-learning based solution, by jointly solving the two subtasks of image layer separation as well as stereo matching. Training our deep net is a simple task, as it does not need to have disparity maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yiran_Zhong_Stereo_Computation_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yiran Zhong, Yuchao Dai, Hongdong Li
Person Search in Videos with One Portrait Through Visual and Temporal Links	In real-world applications, e.g. law enforcement and video retrieval, one often needs to search a certain person in long videos with just one portrait. This is much more challenging than the conventional settings for person re-identification, as the search may need to be carried out in an environments different from where the portrait was taken. In this paper, we aim to tackle this challenge and propose a novel framework, which takes into account the identity invariance along a tracklet, thus allowing person identities to be propagated via both the visual and the temporal links. We also develop a novel scheme called Progressive Propagation via Competitive Consensus, which significantly improves the reliability of the propagation process. To promote the study of person search, we construct a large-scale benchmark, which contains 127K manually annotated tracklets from 192 movies. Experiments show that our approach remarkably outperforms mainstream person re-id methods, raising the mAP from 42.16% to 62.27%.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Qingqiu_Huang_Person_Search_in_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Qingqiu Huang, Wentao Liu, Dahua Lin
Egocentric Activity Prediction via Event Modulated Attention	Predicting future activities from an egocentric viewpoint is of particular interest in assisted living. However, state-of-the-art egocentric activity understanding techniques are mostly NOT capable of predictive tasks, as their synchronous processing architecture performs poorly in either modeling event dependency or pruning temporal redundant features. This work explicitly addresses these issues by proposing an asynchronous gaze-event driven attentive activity prediction network. This network is built on a gaze-event extraction module inspired by the fact that gaze moving in/out a certain object most probably indicates the occurrence/ending of a certain activity. The extracted gaze events are input to: 1) an asynchronous module which reasons about the temporal dependency between events and 2) a synchronous module which softly attends to informative temporal durations for more compact and discriminative feature extraction. Both modules are seamlessly integrated for collaborative prediction. Extensive experimental results on egocentric activity prediction as well as recognition well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yang_Shen_Egocentric_Activity_Prediction_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yang Shen, Bingbing Ni, Zefan Li, Ning Zhuang
SwapNet: Garment Transfer in Single View Images	We present SwapNet, a framework to transfer garments across images of people with arbitrary body pose, shape, and clothing. Garment transfer is a challenging task that requires (i) disentangling the features of the clothing from the body pose and shape and (ii) realistic synthesis of the garment texture on the new body. We present a neural network architecture that tackles these sub-problems with two task-specific sub-networks. Since acquiring pairs of images showing the same clothing on different bodies is difficult, we propose a novel weakly-supervised approach that generates training pairs from a single image via data augmentation. We present the first fully automatic method for garment transfer in unconstrained images without solving the difficult 3D reconstruction problem. We demonstrate a variety of transfer results and highlight our advantages over traditional image-to-image and analogy pipelines.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Amit_Raj_SwapNet_Garment_Transfer_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Amit Raj, Patsorn Sangkloy, Huiwen Chang, Jingwan Lu, Duygu Ceylan, James Hays
The Devil of Face Recognition is in the Noise	The growing scale of face recognition datasets empowers us to train strong convolutional networks for face recognition. While a variety of architectures and loss functions have been devised, we still have a limited understanding of the source and consequence of label noise inherent in existing datasets. We make the following contributions: 1) We contribute cleaned subsets of popular face databases, i.e., MegaFace and MS-Celeb-1M datasets, and build a new large-scale noise-controlled IMDb-Face dataset. 2) With the original datasets and cleaned subsets, we profile and analyze label noise properties of MegaFace and MS-Celeb-1M. We show that a few orders more samples are needed to achieve the same accuracy yielded by a clean subset. 3) We study the association between different types of noise, i.e., label flips and outliers, with the accuracy of face recognition models. 4) We investigate ways to improve data cleanliness, including a comprehensive user study on the influence of data labeling strategies to annotation accuracy.

Weakly Supervised Region Proposal Network and Object Detection	The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based region proposal generation method (i.e. region proposal network), trained using bounding box annotations, is an essential component in modern fully supervised object detectors. However, Weakly Supervised Object Detection (WSOD) has not benefited from CNN-based proposal generation due to the absence of bounding box annotations, and is relying on standard proposal generation methods such as selective search. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised region proposal network which is trained using only image-level annotations. The weakly supervised region proposal network consists of two stages. The first stage evaluates the objectness scores of sliding window boxes by exploiting the low-level information in CNN and the second stage refines the proposals from the first stage using a region-based CNN classifier. Our proposed region proposal network is suitable for WSOD, can be plugged into a WSOD network easily, and can share its convolutional computations with the WSOD network. Experiments on the PASCAL VOC and ImageNet detection datasets show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance for WSOD with performance gain of about 3% on average.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Peng_Tang_Weakly_Supervised_Region_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Peng Tang, Xinggang Wang, Angtian Wang, Yongluan Yan, Wenyu Liu, Junzhou Huang, Alan Yuille
Unveiling the Power of Deep Tracking	In the field of generic object tracking numerous attempts have been made to exploit deep features. Despite all expectations, deep trackers are yet to reach an outstanding level of performance compared to methods solely based on handcrafted features. In this paper, we investigate this key issue and propose an approach to unlock the true potential of deep features for tracking. We systematically study the characteristics of both deep and shallow features, and their relation to tracking accuracy and robustness. We identify the limited data and low spatial resolution as the main challenges, and propose strategies to counter these issues when integrating deep features for tracking. Furthermore, we propose a novel adaptive fusion approach that leverages the complementary properties of deep and shallow features to improve both robustness and accuracy. Extensive experiments are performed on four challenging datasets. On VOT2017, our approach significantly outperforms the top performing tracker from the challenge with a relative gain of 17% in EAO.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Goutam_Bhat_Unveiling_the_Power_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Goutam Bhat, Joakim Johnander, Martin Danelljan, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Michael Felsberg
Video Summarization Using Fully Convolutional Sequence Networks	This paper addresses the problem of video summarization. Given an input video, the goal is to select a subset of the frames to create a summary video that optimally captures the important information of the input video. With the large amount of videos available online, video summarization provides a useful tool that assists video search, retrieval, browsing, etc. In this paper, we formulate video summarization as a sequence labeling problem. Unlike existing approaches that use recurrent models, we propose fully convolutional sequence models to solve video summarization. We firstly establish a novel connection between semantic segmentation and video summarization, and then adapt popular semantic segmentation networks for video summarization. Extensive experiments and analysis on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our models.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Mrigank_Rochan_Video_Summarization_Using_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Mrigank Rochan, Linwei Ye, Yang Wang
Stacked Cross Attention for Image-Text Matching	In this paper, we study the problem of image-text matching. Inferring the latent semantic alignment between objects or other salient stuff (e.g. snow, sky, lawn) and the corresponding words in sentences allows to capture fine-grained interplay between vision and language, and makes image-text matching more interpretable. Prior work either simply aggregates the similarity of all possible pairs of regions and words without attending differentially to more and less important words or regions, or uses a multi-step attentional process to capture limited number of semantic alignments which is less interpretable. In this paper, we present Stacked Cross Attention to discover the full latent alignments using both image regions and words in a sentence as context and infer image-text similarity. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art results on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets. On Flickr30K, our approach outperforms the current best methods by 22.1% relatively in text retrieval from image query, and 18.2% relatively in image retrieval with text query (based on Recall@1). On MS-COCO, our approach improves sentence retrieval by 17.8% relatively and image retrieval by 16.6% relatively (based on Recall@1 using the 5K test set).

Learning 3D Keypoint Descriptors for Non-Rigid Shape Matching	In this paper, we present a novel deep learning framework that derives discriminative local descriptors for 3D surface shapes. In contrast to previous convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that rely on rendering multi-view images or extracting intrinsic shape properties, we parameterize the multi-scale localized neighborhoods of a keypoint into regular 2D grids, which are termed as `geometry images'. The benefits of such geometry images include retaining sufficient geometric information, as well as allowing the usage of standard CNNs. Specifically, we leverage a triplet network to perform deep metric learning, which takes a set of triplets as input, and a newly designed triplet loss function is minimized to distinguish between similar and dissimilar pairs of keypoints. At the testing stage, given a geometry image of a point of interest, our network outputs a discriminative local descriptor for it. Experimental results for non-rigid shape matching on several benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our learned descriptors over traditional descriptors and the state-of-the-art learning-based alternatives.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hanyu_Wang_Learning_3D_Keypoint_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hanyu Wang, Jianwei Guo, Dong-Ming Yan, Weize Quan, Xiaopeng Zhang
Conditional Prior Networks for Optical Flow	Classical computation of optical flow involves generic priors (regularizers) that capture rudimentary statistics of images, but not long-range correlations or semantics. On the other hand, fully supervised methods learn the regularity in the annotated data, without explicit regularization and with the risk of overfitting. We seek to learn richer priors on the set of possible flows that are statistically compatible with an image. Once the prior is learned in a supervised fashion, one can easily learn the full map to infer optical flow directly from two or more images, without any need for (additional) supervision. We introduce a novel architecture, called Conditional Prior Network (CPN), and show how to train it to yield a conditional prior. When used in conjunction with a simple optical flow architecture, the CPN beats all variational method and all unsupervised learning-based ones. It performs comparably to fully supervised ones, that however are fine-tuned to a particular dataset. Our method, on the other hand, performs well even when transferred between datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yanchao_Yang_Conditional_Prior_Networks_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yanchao Yang, Stefano Soatto
Occlusion-aware Hand Pose Estimation Using Hierarchical Mixture Density Network	Learning and predicting the pose parameters of a 3D hand model given an image, such as locations of hand joints, is challenging due to large viewpoint changes and articulations, and severe self-occlusions exhibited particularly in egocentric views. Both feature learning and prediction modeling have been investigated to tackle the problem. Though effective, most existing discriminative methods yield a single deterministic estimation of target poses. Due to their single-value mapping intrinsic, they fail to adequately handle self-occlusion problems, where occluded joints present multiple modes. In this paper, we tackle the self-occlusion issue and provide a complete description of observed poses given an input depth image by a novel method called hierarchical mixture density networks (HMDN). The proposed method leverages the state-of-the-art hand pose estimators based on Convolutional Neural Networks to facilitate feature learning, while it models the multiple modes in a two-level hierarchy to reconcile single-valued and multi-valued mapping in its output. The whole framework with a mixture of two differentiable density functions is naturally end-to-end trainable. In the experiments, HMDN produces interpretable and diverse candidate samples, and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two benchmarks with occlusions, and performs comparably on another benchmark free of occlusions.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Qi_Ye_Occlusion-aware_Hand_Pose_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Qi Ye, Tae-Kyun Kim
HiDDeN: Hiding Data with Deep Networks	Recent work has shown that deep neural networks are highly sensitive to tiny perturbations of input images, giving rise to adversarial examples. Though this property is usually considered a weakness of learned models, we explore whether it can be beneficial. We find that neural networks can learn to use invisible perturbations to encode a rich amount of useful information. In fact, one can exploit this capability for the task of data hiding. We jointly train encoder and decoder networks, where given an input message and cover image, the encoder produces a visually indistinguishable encoded image, from which the decoder can recover the original message. We show that these encodings are competitive with existing data hiding algorithms, and further that they can be made robust to noise: our models learn to reconstruct hidden information in an encoded image despite the presence of Gaussian blurring, pixelwise dropout, cropping, and JPEG compression. Even though JPEG is non-differentiable, we show that a robust model can be trained using differentaible approximations. Finally, we demonstrate that adversarial training improves the visual quality of encoded images.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jiren_Zhu_HiDDeN_Hiding_Data_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jiren Zhu, Russell Kaplan, Justin Johnson, Li Fei-Fei
Neural Stereoscopic Image Style Transfer	Neural style transfer is an emerging technique which is able to endow daily-life images with attractive artistic styles. Previous work has succeeded in applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to style transfer for monocular images or videos. However, style transfer for stereoscopic images is still a missing piece. Different from processing a monocular image, the two views of a stylized stereoscopic pair are required to be consistent to provide observers a comfortable visual experience. In this paper, we propose a novel dual path network for view-consistent style transfer on stereoscopic images. While each view of the stereoscopic pair is processed in an individual path, a novel feature aggregation strategy is proposed to effectively share information between the two paths. Besides a traditional perceptual loss being used for controlling the style transfer quality in each view, a multi-layer view loss is leveraged to enforce the network to coordinate the learning of both the paths to generate view-consistent stylized results. Extensive experiments show that, compared against previous methods, our proposed model can produce stylized stereoscopic images which achieve decent view consistency.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xinyu_Gong_Neural_Stereoscopic_Image_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xinyu Gong, Haozhi Huang, Lin Ma, Fumin Shen, Wei Liu, Tong Zhang
Temporal Modular Networks for Retrieving Complex Compositional Activities in Videos	A major challenge in computer vision is scaling activity understanding to the long tail of complex activities without requiring collecting large quantities of data for new actions. The task of video retrieval using natural language descriptions seeks to address this through rich, unconstrained supervision about complex activities. However, while this formulation offers hope of leveraging underlying compositional structure in activity descriptions, existing approaches typically do not explicitly model compositional reasoning. In this work, we introduce an approach for explicitly and dynamically reasoning about compositional natural language descriptions of activity in videos. We take a modular neural network approach that, given a natural language query, extracts the semantic structure to assemble a compositional neural network layout and corresponding network modules. We show that this approach is able to achieve state-of-the-art results on the DiDeMo video retrieval dataset.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Bingbin_Liu_Temporal_Modular_Networks_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Bingbin Liu, Serena Yeung, Edward Chou, De-An Huang, Li Fei-Fei, Juan Carlos Niebles
Bi-Real Net: Enhancing the Performance of 1-bit CNNs with Improved Representational Capability and Advanced Training Algorithm	In this work, we study the 1-bit convolutional neural networks (CNNs), of which both the weights and activations are binary. While being efficient, the classification accuracy of the current 1-bit CNNs is much worse compared with their counterpart real-valued CNN models on the large-scale dataset, like ImageNet. To shrink the performance gap between the 1-bit and real-valued CNN models, we propose a novel model, dubbed Bi-Real net, which connects the real activations (after the 1-bit convolution and/or BatchNorm layer, before the sign function) to that of the consecutive block, through an identity shortcut. Consequently, compared to the standard 1-bit CNN, the representational capability of the Bi-Real net is significantly enhanced, only with a negligible additional cost on computation. Moreover, we develop a specific training algorithm including three technical novelties for 1-bit CNNs. First, we derive a tight approximation to the derivative of the non-differentiable sign function with respect to activation. Second, we propose a magnitude-aware gradient with respect to weight to update the weight parameter. Last, we pre-train the real-valued CNN model with a clip function, rather than the ReLU function, to provide a better initialization for Bi-Real net. Experiments on ImageNet show that the Bi-Real net with proposed training algorithm achieves 56.4% and 62.2% top-1 accuracy with 18 layers and 34 layers, respectively, and achieves up to 23.9X memory saving and 17.0X computational reduction.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/zechun_liu_Bi-Real_Net_Enhancing_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zechun Liu, Baoyuan Wu, Wenhan Luo, Xin Yang, Wei Liu, Kwang-Ting Cheng
Understanding Degeneracies and Ambiguities in Attribute Transfer	We study the problem of building models that can transfer selected attributes from one image to another without affecting the other attributes. Towards this goal, we develop analysis and a training methodology for autoencoding models, whose encoded features aim to disentangle attributes. These features are explicitly split into two components: one that should represent attributes in common between pairs of images, and another that should represent attributes that change between pairs of images. We show that achieving this objective faces two main challenges: One is that the model may learn degenerate mappings, which we call shortcut problem, and the other is that the attribute representation for an image is not guaranteed to follow the same interpretation on another image, which we call reference ambiguity. To address the shortcut problem, we introduce novel constraints on image pairs and triplets and show their effectiveness both analytically and experimentally. In the case of the reference ambiguity, we formally prove that a model that guarantees an ideal feature separation cannot be built. We validate our findings on several datasets and show that, surprisingly, trained neural networks often do not exhibit the reference ambiguity.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Attila_Szabo_Understanding_Degeneracies_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Attila Szabo, Qiyang Hu, Tiziano Portenier, Matthias Zwicker, Paolo Favaro
A Closed-form Solution to Photorealistic Image Stylization	Photorealistic image stylization concerns transferring style of a reference photo to a content photo with the constraint that the stylized photo should remain photorealistic. While several photorealistic image stylization methods exist, they tend to generate spatially inconsistent stylizations with noticeable artifacts. In this paper, we propose a method to address these issues. The proposed method consists of a stylization step and a smoothing step. While the stylization step transfers the style of the reference photo to the content photo, the smoothing step ensures spatially consistent stylizations. Each of the steps has a closed-form solution and can be computed efficiently. We conduct extensive experimental validations. The results show that the proposed method generates photorealistic stylization outputs that are more preferred by human subjects as compared to those by the competing methods while running much faster. Source code and additional results are available at https://github.com/NVIDIA/FastPhotoStyle.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yijun_Li_A_Closed-form_Solution_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yijun Li, Ming-Yu Liu, Xueting Li, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Jan Kautz
Toward Characteristic-Preserving Image-based Virtual Try-On Network	Image-based virtual try-on systems for fitting new in-shop clothes into a person image have attracted increasing research attention, yet is still challenging. A desirable pipeline should not only transform the target clothes into the most fitting shape seamlessly but also preserve well the clothes identity in the generated image, that is, the key characteristics (e.g. texture, logo, embroidery) that depict the original clothes. However, previous image-conditioned generation works fail to meet these critical requirements towards the plausible virtual try-on performance since they fail to handle large spatial misalignment between the input image and target clothes. Prior work explicitly tackled spatial deformation using shape context matching, but failed to preserve clothing details due to its coarse-to-fine strategy. In this work, we propose a new fully-learnable Characteristic-Preserving Virtual Try-On Network(CP-VTON) for addressing all real-world challenges in this task. First, CP-VTON learns a thin-plate spline transformation for transforming the in-shop clothes into fitting the body shape of the target person via a new Geometric Matching Module (GMM) rather than computing correspondences of interest points as prior works did. Second, to alleviate boundary artifacts of warped clothes and make the results more realistic, we employ a Try-On Module that learns a composition mask to integrate the warped clothes and the rendered image to ensure smoothness. Extensive experiments on a fashion dataset demonstrate our CP-VTON achieves the state-of-the-art virtual try-on performance both qualitatively and quantitatively.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Bochao_Wang_Toward_Characteristic-Preserving_Image-based_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Bochao Wang, Huabin Zheng, Xiaodan Liang, Yimin Chen, Liang Lin, Meng Yang
ADVISE: Symbolism and External Knowledge for Decoding Advertisements	In order to convey the most content in their limited space, advertisements embed references to outside knowledge via symbolism. For example, a motorcycle stands for adventure (a positive property the ad wants associated with the product being sold), and a gun stands for danger (a negative property to dissuade viewers from undesirable behaviors). We show how to use symbolic references to better understand the meaning of an ad. We further show how anchoring ad understanding in general-purpose object recognition and image captioning improves results. We formulate the ad understanding task as matching the ad image to human-generated statements that describe the action that the ad prompts, and the rationale it provides for taking this action. Our proposed method outperforms the state of the art on this task, and on an alternative formulation of question-answering on ads. We show additional applications of our learned representations for matching ads to slogans, and clustering ads according to their topic, without extra training.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Keren_Ye_ADVISE_Symbolism_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Keren Ye, Adriana Kovashka
Appearance-Based Gaze Estimation via Evaluation-Guided Asymmetric Regression	Eye gaze estimation has been increasingly demanded by recent intelligent systems to accomplish a range of interaction-related tasks, by using simple eye images as input. However, learning the highly complex regression between eye images and gaze directions is nontrivial, and thus the problem is yet to be solved efficiently. In this paper, we propose the Asymmetric Regression-Evaluation Network (ARE-Net), and try to improve the gaze estimation performance to its full extent. At the core of our method is the notion of ``two eye asymmetry'' observed during gaze estimation for the left and right eyes. Inspired by this, we design the multi-stream ARE-Net; one asymmetric regression network (AR-Net) predicts 3D gaze directions for both eyes with a novel asymmetric strategy, and the evaluation network (E-Net) adaptively adjusts the strategy by evaluating the two eyes in terms of their performance during optimization. By training the whole network, our method achieves promising results and surpasses the state-of-the-art methods on multiple public datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yihua_Cheng_Appearance-Based_Gaze_Estimation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yihua Cheng, Feng Lu, Xucong Zhang
Interpretable Intuitive Physics Model	Humans have a remarkable ability to use physical commonsense and predict the effect of collisions. But do they understand the underlying factors? Can they predict if the underlying factors have changed? Interestingly, in most cases humans can predict the effects of similar collisions with different conditions such as changes in mass, friction, etc. It is postulated this is primarily because we learn to model physics with meaningful latent variables. This does not imply we can estimate the precise values of these meaningful variables (estimate exact values of mass or friction). Inspired by this observation, we propose an interpretable intuitive physics model where specific dimensions in the bottleneck layers correspond to different physical properties. In order to demonstrate that our system models these underlying physical properties, we train our model on collisions of different shapes (cube, cone, cylinder, spheres etc.) and test on collisions of unseen combinations of shapes. Furthermore, we demonstrate our model generalizes well even when similar scenes are simulated with different underlying properties.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tian_Ye_Interpretable_Intuitive_Physics_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tian Ye, Xiaolong Wang, James Davidson, Abhinav Gupta
Sparsely Aggregated Convolutional Networks	We explore a key architectural aspect of deep convolutional neural networks: the pattern of internal skip connections used to aggregate outputs of earlier layers for consumption by deeper layers. Such aggregation is critical to facilitate training of very deep networks in an end-to-end manner. This is a primary reason for the widespread adoption of residual networks, which aggregate outputs via cumulative summation. While subsequent works investigate alternative aggregation operations (eg~concatenation), we focus on an orthogonal question: which outputs to aggregate at a particular point in the network. We propose a new internal connection structure which aggregates only a sparse set of previous outputs at any given depth. Our experiments demonstrate this simple design change offers superior performance with fewer parameters and lower computational requirements. Moreover, we show that sparse aggregation allows networks to scale more robustly to 1000+ layers, thereby opening future avenues for training long-running visual processes.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ligeng_Zhu_Sparsely_Aggregated_Convolutional_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ligeng Zhu, Ruizhi Deng, Michael Maire, Zhiwei Deng, Greg Mori, Ping Tan
Deep Bilevel Learning	We present a novel regularization approach to train neural networks that enjoys better generalization and test error than standard stochastic gradient descent. Our approach is based on the principles of cross-validation, where a validation set is used to limit the model overfitting. We formulate such principles as a bilevel optimization problem. This formulation allows us to define the optimization of a cost on the validation set subject to another optimization on the training set. The overfitting is controlled by introducing weights on each mini-batch in the training set and by choosing their values so that they minimize the error on the validation set. In practice, these weights define mini-batch learning rates in a gradient descent update equation that favor gradients with better generalization capabilities. Because of its simplicity, this approach can be integrated with other regularization methods and training schemes. We evaluate extensively our proposed algorithm on several neural network architectures and datasets, and find that it consistently improves the generalization of the model, especially when labels are noisy.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Simon_Jenni_Deep_Bilevel_Learning_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Simon Jenni, Paolo Favaro
Estimating the Success of Unsupervised Image to Image Translation	While in supervised learning, the validation error is an unbiased estimator of the generalization (test) error and complexity-based generalization bounds are abundant, no such bounds exist for learning a mapping in an unsupervised way. As a result, when training GANs and specifically when using GANs for learning to map between domains in a completely unsupervised way, one is forced to select the hyperparameters and the stopping epoch by subjectively examining multiple options. We propose a novel bound for predicting the success of unsupervised cross domain mapping methods, which is motivated by the recently proposed simplicity hypothesis. The bound can be applied both in expectation, for comparing hyperparameters, or per sample, in order to predict the success of a specific cross-domain translation. The utility of the bound is demonstrated in an extensive set of experiments employing multiple recent algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/sagiebenaim/gan_bound.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Lior_Wolf_Estimating_the_Success_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Sagie Benaim, Tomer Galanti, Lior Wolf
Real-time 'Actor-Critic' Tracking	In this work, we propose a novel tracking algorithm with real-time performance based on the 'Actor-Critic' framework. This framework consists of two major components: 'Actor' and 'Critic'. The 'Actor' model aims to infer the optimal choice in a continuous action space, which directly makes the tracker move the bounding box to the object location in the current frame. For offline training,the'Critic'modelisintroducedtoforma'Actor-Critic'frameworkwith reinforcement learning and outputs a Q-value to guide the learning process of both 'Actor' and 'Critic' deep networks. Then, we modify the original deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to effectively train our 'Actor-Critic' model for the tracking task. For online tracking, the 'Actor' model provides a dynamic search strategy to locate the tracked object efficiently and the 'Critic' model acts as a verification module to make our tracker more robust. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to exploit the continuous action and 'Actor-Critic' framework for visual tracking. Extensive experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed tracker performs favorably against many state-of-the-art methods, with real-time performance.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Boyu_Chen_Real-time_Actor-Critic_Tracking_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Boyu Chen, Dong Wang, Peixia Li, Shuang Wang, Huchuan Lu
Pose Guided Human Video Generation	Due to the emergence of Generative Adversarial Networks, video synthesis has witnessed exceptional breakthroughs. However, existing methods lack a proper representation to explicitly control the dynamics in videos. Human pose, on the other hand, can represent motion patterns intrinsically and interpretably, and impose the geometric constraints regardless of appearance. In this paper, we propose a pose guided method to synthesize human videos in a disentangled way: plausible motion prediction and coherent appearance generation. In the first stage, a Pose Sequence Generative Adversarial Network (PSGAN) learns in an adversarial manner to yield pose sequences conditioned on the class label. In the second stage, a Semantic Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (SCGAN) generates video frames from the poses while preserving coherent appearances in the input image. By enforcing semantic consistency between the generated and ground-truth poses at a high feature level, our SCGAN is robust to noisy or abnormal poses. Extensive experiments on both human action and human face datasets manifest the superiority of the proposed method over other state-of-the-arts.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ceyuan_Yang_Pose_Guided_Human_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ceyuan Yang, Zhe Wang, Xinge Zhu, Chen Huang, Jianping Shi, Dahua Lin
Where are the blobs: Counting by Localization with Point Supervision	Object counting is an important task in computer vision due to its growing demand in applications such as surveillance, traffic monitoring, and counting everyday objects. State-of-the-art methods use regression-based optimization where they explicitly learn to count the objects of interest. These often perform better than detection-based methods that need to learn the more difficult task of predicting the location, size, and shape of each object. However, we propose a detection-based method that does not need to estimate the size and shape of the objects and that outperforms regression-based methods. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) we propose a novel loss function that encourages the network to output a single blob per object instance using point-level annotations only; (2) we design two methods for splitting large predicted blobs between object instances; and (3) we show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on several challenging datasets including the Pascal VOC and the Penguins dataset. Our method even outperforms those that use stronger supervision such as depth features, multi-point annotations, and bounding-box labels.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Issam_Hadj_Laradji_Where_are_the_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Issam H.

Deep Fundamental Matrix Estimation	We present an approach to robust estimation of fundamental matrices from noisy data contaminated by outliers. The problem is cast as a series of weighted homogeneous least-squares problems, where robust weights are estimated using deep networks. The presented formulation acts directly on putative correspondences and thus fits into standard 3D vision pipelines that perform feature extraction, matching, and model fitting. The approach can be trained end-to-end and yields computationally efficient robust estimators. Our experiments indicate that the presented approach is able to train robust estimators that outperform classic approaches on real data by a significant margin.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Rene_Ranftl_Deep_Fundamental_Matrix_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Rene Ranftl, Vladlen Koltun
Disentangling Factors of Variation with Cycle-Consistent Variational Auto-Encoders	Generative models that learn disentangled representations for different factors of variation in an image can be very useful for targeted data augmentation. By sampling from the disentangled latent subspace of interest, we can efficiently generate new data necessary for a particular task. Learning disentangled representations is a challenging problem, especially when certain factors of variation are difficult to label. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture that disentangles the latent space into two complementary subspaces by using only weak supervision in form of pairwise similarity labels. Inspired by the recent success of cycle-consistent adversarial architectures, we use cycle-consistency in a variational auto-encoder framework. Our non-adversarial approach is in contrast with the recent works that combine adversarial training with auto-encoders to disentangle representations. We show compelling results of disentangled latent subspaces on three datasets and compare with recent works that leverage adversarial training.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ananya_Harsh_Jha_Disentangling_Factors_of_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ananya Harsh Jha, Saket Anand, Maneesh Singh, VSR Veeravasarapu
Question-Guided Hybrid Convolution for Visual Question Answering	In this paper, we propose a novel Question-Guided Hybrid Convolution (QGHC) network for Visual Question Answering (VQA). Most state-of-the-art VQA methods fuse the high-level textual and visual features from the neural network and abandon the visual spatial information when learning multi-modal features. To address these problems, question-guided kernels generated from the input question are designed to convolute with visual features for capturing the textual and visual relationship in the early stage. The question-guided convolution can tightly couple the textual and visual information but also introduces more parameters when learning kernels. We apply the group convolution which consists of question-independent kernels and question-dependent kernels, to reduce the parameter size and release the over-fitting. The hybrid convolution can generate discriminative multi-modal features with fewer parameters. Our proposed approach is also complementary to existing bilinear pooling fusion methods and attention methods. Integration with them could further boost the performance. Extensive experiments on public VQA datasets validate the effectiveness of QGHC.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/gao_peng_Question-Guided_Hybrid_Convolution_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Peng Gao, Hongsheng Li, Shuang Li, Pan Lu, Yikang Li, Steven C.H.

Shift-Net: Image Inpainting via Deep Feature Rearrangement	Deep convolutional networks (CNNs) have exhibited their potential in image inpainting for producing plausible results. However, in most existing methods, e.g., context encoder, the missing parts are predicted by propagating the surrounding convolutional features through a fully connected layer, which intends to produce semantically plausible but blurry result. In this paper, we introduce a special shift-connection layer to the U-Net architecture, namely Shift-Net, for filling in missing regions of any shape with sharp structures and fine-detailed textures. To this end, the encoder feature of the known region is shifted to serve as an estimation of the missing parts. A guidance loss is introduced on decoder feature to minimize the distance between the decoder feature after fully connected layer and the ground-truth encoder feature of the missing parts. With such constraint, the decoder feature in missing region can be used to guide the shift of encoder feature in known region. An end-to-end learning algorithm is further developed to train the Shift-Net. Experiments on the Paris StreetView and Places datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our Shift-Net in producing sharper, fine-detailed, and visually plausible results. The codes and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/Zhaoyi-Yan/Shift-Net.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhaoyi_Yan_Shift-Net_Image_Inpainting_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhaoyi Yan, Xiaoming Li, Mu Li, Wangmeng Zuo, Shiguang Shan
Learning Warped Guidance for Blind Face Restoration	This paper studies the problem of blind face restoration from an unconstrained blurry, noisy, low-resolution, or compressed image (i.e., degraded observation). For better recovery of fine facial details, we modify the problem setting by taking both the degraded observation and a high-quality guided image of the same identity as input to our guided face restoration network (GFRNet). However, the degraded observation and guided image generally are different in pose, illumination and expression, thereby making plain CNNs (e.g., U-Net) fail to recover fine and identity-aware facial details. To tackle this issue, our GFRNet model includes both a warping subnetwork (WarpNet) and a reconstruction subnetwork (RecNet). The WarpNet is introduced to predict flow field for warping the guided image to correct pose and expression (i.e., warped guidance), while the RecNet takes the degraded observation and warped guidance as input to produce the restoration result. Due to that the ground-truth flow field is unavailable, landmark loss together with total variation regularization are incorporated to guide the learning of WarpNet. Furthermore, to make the model applicable to blind restoration, our GFRNet is trained on the synthetic data with versatile settings on blur kernel, noise level, downsampling scale factor, and JPEG quality factor. Experiments show that our GFRNet not only performs favorably against the state-of-the-art image and face restoration methods, but also generates visually photo-realistic results on real degraded facial images.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiaoming_Li_Learning_Warped_Guidance_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiaoming Li, Ming Liu, Yuting Ye, Wangmeng Zuo, Liang Lin, Ruigang Yang
LAPRAN: A Scalable Laplacian Pyramid Reconstructive Adversarial Network for Flexible Compressive Sensing Reconstruction	This paper addresses the single-image compressive sensing (CS) and reconstruction problem. We propose a scalable Laplacian pyramid reconstructive adversarial network (LAPRAN) that enables high-fidelity, flexible and fast CS images reconstruction. LAPRAN progressively reconstructs an image following the concept of the Laplacian pyramid through multiple stages of reconstructive adversarial networks (RANs). At each pyramid level, CS measurements are fused with a contextual latent vector to generate a high-frequency image residual. Consequently, LAPRAN can produce hierarchies of reconstructed images and each with an incremental resolution and improved quality. The scalable pyramid structure of LAPRAN enables high-fidelity CS reconstruction with a flexible resolution that is adaptive to a wide range of compression ratios (CRs), which is infeasible with existing methods. Experimental results on multiple public datasets show that LAPRAN offers an average 7.47dB and 5.98dB PSNR, and an average 57.93% and 33.20% SSIM improvement compared to model-based and data-driven baselines, respectively.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Kai_Xu_LAPCSRA_Deep_Laplacian_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Kai XU, Zhikang Zhang, Fengbo Ren
Pairwise Relational Networks for Face Recognition	Existing face recognition using deep neural networks is difficult to know what kind of features are used to discriminate the identities of face images clearly. To investigate the effective features for face recognition, we propose a novel face recognition method, called a pairwise relational network (PRN), that obtains local appearance patches around landmark points on the feature map, and captures the pairwise relation between a pair of local appearance patches. The PRN is trained to capture unique and discriminative pairwise relations among different identities. Because the existence and meaning of pairwise relations should be identity dependent, we add a face identity state feature, which obtains from the long short-term memory (LSTM) units network with the sequential local appearance patches on the feature maps, to the PRN. To further improve accuracy of face recognition, we combined the global appearance representation with the pairwise relational feature. Experimental results on the LFW show that the PRN using only pairwise relations achieved 99.65% accuracy and the PRN using both pairwise relations and face identity state feature achieved 99.76% accuracy. On the YTF, both the PRN using only pairwise relations and the PRN using pairwise relations and the face identity state feature achieved the state-of-the-art (95.7% and 96.3%). The PRN also achieved comparable results to the state-of-the-art for both face verification and face identification tasks on the IJB-A, and the state-of-the-art on the IJB-B.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Kang_Pairwise_Relational_Networks_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Bong-Nam Kang, Yonghyun Kim, Daijin Kim
Deep Texture and Structure Aware Filtering Network for Image Smoothing	"Image smoothing is a fundamental task in computer vision, which aims to retain salient structures and remove insignificant textures. In this paper, we tackle the natural deficiency of existing methods, that they cannot properly distinguish textures and structures with similar low-level appearance. While deep learning approaches have addressed preserving structures, they do not yet properly address textures. To this end, we generate a large dataset by blending natural textures with clean structure-only images, and then build a texture prediction network (TPN) that predicts location and magnitude of textures. After that, we combine it with a semantic structure prediction network (SPN) so that the final texture and structure aware filtering network (TSAFN) is informed the textures to remove (""texture-awareness"") and the structures to preserve (""structure-awareness""). The proposed model is easy to understand and implement, and shows excellent performance on real images in the wild as well as our generated dataset."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Kaiyue_Lu_Deep_Texture_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Kaiyue Lu, Shaodi You, Nick Barnes
End-to-End Joint Semantic Segmentation of Actors and Actions in Video	Traditional video understanding tasks include human action recognition and actor/object semantic segmentation. However, the combined task of providing semantic segmentation for different actor classes simultaneously with their action class remains a challenging but necessary task for many applications. In this work, we propose a new end-to-end architecture for tackling this task in videos. Our model effectively leverages multiple input modalities, contextual information, and multitask learning in the video to directly output semantic segmentations in a single unified framework. We train and benchmark our model on the Actor-Action Dataset (A2D) for joint actor-action semantic segmentation, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for both segmentation and detection. We also perform experiments verifying our approach improves performance for zero-shot recognition, indicating generalizability of our jointly learned feature space.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jingwei_Ji_End-to-End_Joint_Semantic_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jingwei Ji, Shyamal Buch, Alvaro Soto, Juan Carlos Niebles
Self-Supervised Relative Depth Learning for Urban Scene Understanding	As an agent moves through the world, the apparent motion of scene elements is (usually) inversely proportional to their depth. It is natural for a learning agent to associate image patterns with the magnitude of their displacement over time: as the agent moves, faraway mountains don't move much; nearby trees move a lot. This natural relationship between the appearance of objects and their motion is a rich source of information about the world. In this work, we start by training a deep network, using fully automatic supervision, to predict relative scene depth from single images. The relative depth training images are automatically derived from simple videos of cars moving through a scene, using recent motion segmentation techniques, and no human-provided labels. This proxy task of predicting relative depth from a single image induces features in the network that result in large improvements in a set of downstream tasks including semantic segmentation, joint road segmentation and car detection, and monocular (absolute) depth estimation, over a network trained from scratch. The improvement on the semantic segmentation task is greater than those produced by any other automatically supervised methods. Moreover, for monocular depth estimation, our unsupervised pre-training method even outperforms supervised pre-training with ImageNet. In addition, we demonstrate benefits from learning to predict (again, completely unsupervised) relative depth in the specific videos associated with various downstream tasks (e.g., KITTI). We adapt to the specific scenes in those tasks in an unsupervised manner to improve performance. In summary, for semantic segmentation, we present state-of-the-art results among methods that do not use supervised pre-training, and we even exceed the performance of supervised ImageNet pre-trained models for monocular depth estimation, achieving results that are comparable with state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Huaizu_Jiang_Self-Supervised_Relative_Depth_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Huaizu Jiang, Gustav Larsson, Michael Maire Greg Shakhnarovich, Erik Learned-Miller
To learn image super-resolution, use a GAN to learn how to do image degradation first	This paper is on image and face super-resolution. The vast majority of prior work for this problem focus on how to increase the resolution of low-resolution images which are artificially generated by simple bilinear down-sampling (or in a few cases by blurring followed by down-sampling). We show that such methods fail to produce good results when applied to real-world low-resolution, low quality images. To circumvent this problem, we propose a two-stage process which firstly trains a High-to-Low Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to learn how to degrade and downsample high-resolution images requiring, during training, only extit{unpaired} high and low-resolution images. Once this is achieved, the output of this network is used to train a Low-to-High GAN for image super-resolution using this time extit{paired} low- and high-resolution images. Our main result is that this network can be now used to effectively increase the quality of real-world low-resolution images. We have applied the proposed pipeline for the problem of face super-resolution where we report large improvement over baselines and prior work although the proposed method is potentially applicable to other object categories.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Adrian_Bulat_To_learn_image_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Adrian Bulat, Jing Yang, Georgios Tzimiropoulos
Data-Driven Sparse Structure Selection for Deep Neural Networks	Deep convolutional neural networks have liberated its extraordinary power on various tasks. However, it is still very challenging to deploy state-of-the-art models into real-world applications due to their high computational complexity. How can we design a compact and effective network without massive experiments and expert knowledge? In this paper, we propose a simple and effective framework to learn and prune deep models in an end-to-end manner. In our framework, a new type of parameter -- scaling factor is first introduced to scale the outputs of specific structures, such as neurons, groups or residual blocks. Then we add sparsity regularizations on these factors, and solve this optimization problem by a modified stochastic Accelerated Proximal Gradient (APG) method. By forcing some of the factors to zero, we can safely remove the corresponding structures, thus prune the unimportant parts of a CNN. Comparing with other structure selection methods that may need thousands of trials or iterative fine-tuning, our method is trained fully end-to-end in one training pass without bells and whistles. We evaluate our method, Sparse Structure Selection with several state-of-the-art CNNs, and demonstrate very promising results with adaptive depth and width selection. Code is available at: https://github.com/huangzehao/sparse-structure-selection.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zehao_Huang_Data-Driven_Sparse_Structure_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zehao Huang, Naiyan Wang
Deep Adaptive Attention for Joint Facial Action Unit Detection and Face Alignment	Facial action unit (AU) detection and face alignment are two highly correlated tasks since facial landmarks can provide precise AU locations to facilitate the extraction of meaningful local features for AU detection. Most existing AU detection works often treat face alignment as a preprocessing and handle the two tasks independently. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning framework for joint AU detection and face alignment, which has not been explored before. In particular, multi-scale shared features are learned firstly, and high-level features of face alignment are fed into AU detection. Moreover, to extract precise local features, we propose an adaptive attention learning module to refine the attention map of each AU adaptively. Finally, the assembled local features are integrated with face alignment features and global features for AU detection. Experiments on BP4D and DISFA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for AU detection.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhiwen_Shao_Deep_Adaptive_Attention_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhiwen Shao, Zhilei Liu, Jianfei Cai, Lizhuang Ma
Learning Visual Question Answering by Bootstrapping Hard Attention	Attention mechanisms in biological perception are thought to select subsets of perceptual information for more sophisticated processing which would be prohibitive to perform on all sensory inputs. In computer vision, however, there has been relatively little exploration of hard attention, where some information is selectively ignored, in spite of the success of soft attention, where information is re-weighted and aggregated, but never filtered out. Here, we introduce a new approach for hard attention and find it achieves very competitive performance on a recently-released visual question answering dataset, equalling and in some cases surpassing similar soft attention architectures while entirely ignoring some features. Even though the hard attention mechanism is not differentiable, we found that the feature magnitudes correlate with semantic relevance, and provided a useful signal for our mechanism's attentional selection criterion. Because hard attention selects important features of the input information, it can also be more efficient than analogous soft attention mechanisms. This is especially important for recent approaches that use non-local pairwise operations, whereby computational and memory costs are quadratic in the size of the set of features.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Mateusz_Malinowski_Learning_Visual_Question_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Mateusz Malinowski, Carl Doersch, Adam Santoro, Peter Battaglia
End-to-End Deep Structured Models for Drawing Crosswalks	In this paper we address the problem of detecting crosswalks from LiDAR and camera imagery. Towards this goal, given multiple LiDAR sweeps and the corresponding imagery, we project both inputs onto the ground surface to produce a top down view of the scene. We then leverage convolutional neural networks to extract semantic cues about the location of the crosswalks. These are then used in combination with road centerlines from freely available maps (e.g., OpenStreetMaps) to solve a structured optimization problem which draws the final crosswalk boundaries. Our experiments over crosswalks in a large city area show that 96.6% automation can be achieved.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Justin_Liang_End-to-End_Deep_Structured_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Justin Liang, Raquel Urtasun
Museum Exhibit Identification Challenge for the Supervised Domain Adaptation and Beyond	We study an open problem of artwork identification and propose a new dataset dubbed Open Museum Identification Challenge (Open MIC). It contains photos of exhibits captured in 10 distinct exhibition spaces of several museums which showcase paintings, timepieces, sculptures, glassware, relics, science exhibits, natural history pieces, ceramics, pottery, tools and indigenous crafts. The goal of Open MIC is to stimulate research in domain adaptation, egocentric recognition and few-shot learning by providing a testbed complementary to the famous Office dataset which reaches ~90% accuracy. To form our dataset, we captured a number of images per art piece with a mobile phone and wearable cameras to form the source and target data splits, respectively. To achieve robust baselines, we build on a recent approach that aligns per-class scatter matrices of the source and target CNN streams. Moreover, we exploit the positive definite nature of such representations by using end-to-end Bregman divergences and the Riemannian metric. We present baselines such as training/evaluation per exhibition and training/evaluation on the combined set covering 866 exhibit identities. As each exhibition poses distinct challenges e.g., quality of lighting, motion blur, occlusions, clutter, viewpoint and scale variations, rotations, glares, transparency, non-planarity, clipping, we break down results w.r.t. these factors.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Piotr_Koniusz_Museum_Exhibit_Identification_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Piotr Koniusz, Yusuf Tas, Hongguang Zhang, Mehrtash Harandi, Fatih Porikli, Rui Zhang
Attention-aware Deep Adversarial Hashing for Cross-Modal Retrieval	Due to the rapid growth of multi-modal data, hashing methods for cross-modal retrieval have received considerable attention. However, finding content similarities between different modalities of data is still challenging due to an existing heterogeneity gap. To further address this problem, we propose an adversarial hashing network with an attention mechanism to enhance the measurement of content similarities by selectively focusing on the informative parts of multi-modal data. The proposed new deep adversarial network consists of three building blocks: 1) the feature learning module to obtain the feature representations; 2) the attention module to generate an attention mask, which is used to divide the feature representations into the attended and unattended feature representations; and 3) the hashing module to learn hash functions that preserve the similarities between different modalities. In our framework, the attention and hashing modules are trained in an adversarial way: the attention module attempts to make the hashing module unable to preserve the similarities of multi-modal data w.r.t. the unattended feature representations, while the hashing module aims to preserve the similarities of multi-modal data w.r.t. the attended and unattended feature representations. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method brings substantial improvements over other state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xi_Zhang_Attention-aware_Deep_Adversarial_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xi Zhang, Hanjiang Lai , Jiashi Feng
3D Face Reconstruction from Light Field Images: A Model-free Approach	Reconstructing 3D facial geometry from a single RGB image has recently instigated wide research interest. However, it is still an ill-posed problem and most methods rely on prior models hence undermining the accuracy of the recovered 3D faces. In this paper, we exploit the Epipolar Plane Images (EPI) obtained from light field cameras and learn CNN models that recover horizontal and vertical 3D facial curves from the respective horizontal and vertical EPIs. Our 3D face reconstruction network (FaceLFnet) comprises a densely connected architecture to learn accurate 3D facial curves from low resolution EPIs. To train the proposed FaceLFnets from scratch, we synthesize photo-realistic light field images from 3D facial scans. The curve by curve 3D face estimation approach allows the networks to learn from only 14K images of 80 identities, which still comprises over 11 Million EPIs/curves. The estimated facial curves are merged into a single pointcloud to which a surface is fitted to get the final 3D face. Our method is model-free, requires only a few training samples to learn FaceLFnet and can reconstruct 3D faces with high accuracy from single light field images under varying poses, expressions and lighting conditions. Comparison on the BU-3DFE and BU-4DFE datasets show that our method reduces reconstruction errors by over 20% compared to recent state of the art.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Mingtao_Feng_3D_Face_Reconstruction_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Mingtao Feng, Syed Zulqarnain Gilani, Yaonan Wang, Ajmal Mian
Generating 3D Faces using Convolutional Mesh Autoencoders	Learned 3D representations of human faces are useful for computer vision problems such as 3D face tracking and reconstruction from images, as well as graphics applications such as character generation and animation. Traditional models learn a latent representation of a face using linear subspaces or higher-order tensor generalizations. Due to this linearity, they can not capture extreme deformations and non-linear expressions. To address this, we introduce a versatile model that learns a non-linear representation of a face using spectral convolutions on a mesh surface. We introduce mesh sampling operations that enable a hierarchical mesh representation that captures non-linear variations in shape and expression at multiple scales within the model. In a variational setting, our model samples diverse realistic 3D faces from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Our training data consists of 20,466 meshes of extreme expressions captured over 12 different subjects. Despite limited training data, our trained model outperforms state-of-the-art face models with 50% lower reconstruction error, while using 75% fewer parameters. We also show that, replacing the expression space of an existing state-of-the-art face model with our autoencoder, achieves a lower reconstruction error.

Effective Use of Synthetic Data for Urban Scene Semantic Segmentation	Training a deep network to perform semantic segmentation requires large amounts of labeled data. To alleviate the manual effort of annotating real images, researchers have investigated the use of synthetic data, which can be labeled automatically. Unfortunately, a network trained on synthetic data performs relatively poorly on real images. While this can be addressed by domain adaptation, existing methods all require having access to real images during training. In this paper, we introduce a drastically different way to handle synthetic images that does not require seeing any real images at training time. Our approach builds on the observation that foreground and background classes are not affected in the same manner by the domain shift, and thus should be treated differently. In particular, the former should be handled in a detection-based manner to better account for the fact that, while their texture in synthetic images is not photo-realistic, their shape looks natural. Our experiments evidence the effectiveness of our approach on Cityscapes and CamVid with models trained on synthetic data only.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Fatemeh_Sadat_Saleh_Effective_Use_of_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Fatemeh Sadat Saleh, Mohammad Sadegh Aliakbarian, Mathieu Salzmann, Lars Petersson, Jose M.

Superpixel Sampling Networks	"Superpixels provide an efficient low/mid-level representation of image data, which greatly reduces the number of image primitives for subsequent vision tasks. Existing superpixel algorithms are not differentiable, making them difficult to integrate into otherwise end-to-end trainable deep neural networks. We develop a new differentiable model for superpixel sampling that leverages deep networks for learning superpixel segmentation. The resulting ""Superpixel Sampling Network"" (SSN) is end-to-end trainable, which allows learning task-specific superpixels with flexible loss functions and has fast runtime. Extensive experimental analysis indicates that SSNs not only outperform existing superpixel algorithms on traditional segmentation benchmarks, but can also learn superpixels for other tasks. In addition, SSNs can be easily integrated into downstream deep networks resulting in performance improvements."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Varun_Jampani_Superpixel_Sampling_Networks_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Varun Jampani, Deqing Sun, Ming-Yu Liu, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Jan Kautz
How good is my GAN?	Generative adverserial networks (GANs) are one of the most popular methods for generating images today. While impressive results have been validated by visual inspection, a number of quantitive criteria have emerged only recently. We argue here that the existing ones are insufficient and need to be in adequation with the task at hand. In this paper we introduce two measures based on image classification---GAN-train and GAN-test, which approximate the recall (diversity) and precision (quality of the image) of GANs respectively. We evaluate a number of recent GAN approaches based on these two measures and demonstrate a clear difference in performance. Furthermore, we observe that the increasing difficulty of the dataset, from CIFAR10 over CIFAR100 to ImageNet, shows an inverse correlation with the quality of the GANs, as clearly evident from our measures.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Konstantin_Shmelkov_How_good_is_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Konstantin Shmelkov, Cordelia Schmid, Karteek Alahari
Efficient 6-DoF Tracking of Handheld Objects from an Egocentric Viewpoint	Virtual and augmented reality technologies have seen significant growth in the past few years. A key component of such systems is the ability to track the pose of head mounted displays and controllers in 3D space. We tackle the problem of efficient 6-DoF tracking of a handheld controller from egocentric camera perspectives. We collected the HMD Controller dataset which consist of over 540,000 stereo image pairs labelled with the full 6-DoF pose of the handheld controller. Our proposed SSD-AF-Stereo3D model achieves a mean average error of 33.5 millimeters in 3D keypoint prediction and is used in conjunction with an IMU sensor on the controller to enable 6-DoF tracking. We also present results on approaches for model based full 6-DoF tracking.

Deep Adversarial Attention Alignment for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation: the Benefit of Target Expectation Maximization	In this paper, we make two contributions to unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) using the convolutional neural network (CNN). First, our approach transfers knowledge in all the convolutional layers through attention alignment. Most previous methods align high-level representations, e.g., activations of the fully connected (FC) layer. In these methods, however, the convolutional layers which underpin critical low-level domain knowledge cannot be updated directly towards reducing domain discrepancy. Specifically, we assume that the discriminative regions in an image are relatively invariant to image style changes. Based on this assumption, we propose an attention alignment scheme on all the target convolutional layers to uncover the knowledge shared by the source domain. Second, we estimate the posterior label distribution of the unlabeled data for target network training. Previous methods, which iteratively update the pseudo labels by the target network and refine the target network by the updated pseudo labels, are vulnerable to label estimation errors. Instead, our approach uses category distribution to calculate the cross-entropy loss for training, thereby ameliorating the error accumulation of the estimated labels. The two contributions allow our approach to outperform the state-of-the-art methods by +2.6% on the Office-31 dataset.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Guoliang_Kang_Deep_Adversarial_Attention_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Guoliang Kang, Liang Zheng, Yan Yan, Yi Yang
Revisiting Autofocus for Smartphone Cameras	Autofocus (AF) on smartphones is the process of determining how to move a camera's lens such that certain scene content is in focus. The underlying algorithms used by AF systems, such as contrast detection and phase differencing, are well established. However, determining a high-level objective regarding how to best focus a particular scene is less clear. This is evident in part by the fact that different smartphone cameras employ different AF criteria; for example, some attempt to keep items in the center in focus, others give priority to faces while others maximize the sharpness of the entire scene. The fact that different objectives exist raises the research question of whether there is a preferred objective. This becomes more interesting when AF is applied to videos of dynamic scenes. The work in this paper aims to revisit AF for smartphones within the context of temporal image data. As part of this effort, we describe the capture of a new 4D dataset that provides access to a full focal stack at each time point in a temporal sequence. Based on this dataset, we have developed a platform and associated application programming interface (API) that mimic real AF systems, restricting lens motion within the constraints of a dynamic environment and frame capture. Using our platform we evaluated several high-level focusing objectives and found interesting insight into what users prefer. We believe our new temporal focal stack dataset, AF platform, and initial user-study findings will be useful in advancing AF research.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Abdullah_Abuolaim_Revisiting_Autofocus_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Abdullah Abuolaim, Abhijith Punnappurath, Michael S.

Scale-Awareness of Light Field Camera based Visual Odometry	We propose a novel direct visual odometry algorithm for micro-lens-array-based light field cameras. The algorithm calculates a detailed, semi-dense 3D point cloud of its environment. This is achieved by establishing probabilistic depth hypotheses based on stereo observations between the micro images of different recordings. Tracking is performed in a coarse-to-fine process, working directly on the recorded raw images. The tracking accounts for changing lighting conditions and utilizes a linear motion model to be more robust. A novel scale optimization framework is proposed. It estimates the scene scale, on the basis of keyframes, and optimizes the scale of the entire trajectory by filtering over multiple estimates. The method is tested based on a versatile dataset consisting of challenging indoor and outdoor sequences and is compared to state-of-the-art monocular and stereo approaches. The algorithm shows the ability to recover the absolute scale of the scene and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art monocular algorithms with respect to scale drifts.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Niclas_Zeller_Scale-Awareness_of_Light_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Niclas Zeller, Franz Quint, Uwe Stilla
Semi-Dense 3D Reconstruction with a Stereo Event Camera	Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that offer several advantages, such as low latency, high-speed and high dynamic range, to tackle challenging scenarios in computer vision. This paper presents a solution to the problem of 3D reconstruction from data captured by a stereo event-camera rig moving in a static scene, such as in the context of stereo Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. The proposed method consists of the optimization of an energy function designed to exploit small-baseline spatio-temporal consistency of events triggered across both stereo image planes. To improve the density of the reconstruction and to reduce the uncertainty of the estimation, a probabilistic depth-fusion strategy is also developed. The resulting method has no special requirements on either the motion of the stereo event-camera rig or on prior knowledge about the scene. Experiments demonstrate our method can deal with both texture-rich scenes as well as sparse scenes, outperforming state-of-the-art stereo methods based on event data image representations.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yi_Zhou_Semi-Dense_3D_Reconstruction_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yi Zhou, Guillermo Gallego, Henri Rebecq, Laurent Kneip, Hongdong Li, Davide Scaramuzza
Learning and Matching Multi-View Descriptors for Registration of Point Clouds	Critical to the registration of point clouds is the establishment of a set of accurate correspondences between points in 3D space. The correspondence problem is generally addressed by the design of discriminative 3D local descriptors on the one hand, and the development of robust matching strategies on the other hand. In this work, we first propose a multi-view local descriptor, which is learned from the images of multiple views, for the description of 3D keypoints. Then, we develop a robust matching approach, aiming at rejecting outlier matches based on the efficient inference via belief propagation on the defined graphical model. We have demonstrated the boost of our approaches to registration on the public scanning and multi-view stereo datasets. The superior performance has been verified by the intensive comparisons against a variety of descriptors and matching methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Lei_Zhou_Learning_and_Matching_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Lei Zhou, Siyu Zhu, Zixin Luo, Tianwei Shen, Runze Zhang, Mingmin Zhen, Tian Fang, Long Quan
Memory Aware Synapses: Learning what (not) to forget	Humans can learn in a continuous manner. Old rarely utilized knowledge can be overwritten by new incoming information while important, frequently used knowledge is prevented from being erased. In artificial learning systems, lifelong learning so far has focused mainly on accumulating knowledge over tasks and overcoming catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we argue that, given the limited model capacity and the unlimited new information to be learned, knowledge has to be preserved or erased selectively. Inspired by neuroplasticity, we propose a novel approach for lifelong learning, coined Memory Aware Synapses (MAS). It computes the importance of the parameters of a neural network in an unsupervised and online manner. Given a new sample which is fed to the network, MAS accumulates an importance measure for each parameter of the network, based on how sensitive the predicted output function is to a change in this parameter. When learning a new task, changes to important parameters can then be penalized, effectively preventing important knowledge related to previous tasks from being overwritten. Further, we show an interesting connection between a local version of our method and Hebb's rule, which is a model for the learning process in the brain. We test our method on a sequence of object recognition tasks and on the challenging problem of learning an embedding for predicting triplets. We show state-of-the-art performance and, for the first time, the ability to adapt the importance of the parameters based on unlabeled data towards what the network needs (not) to forget, which may vary depending on test conditions.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Rahaf_Aljundi_Memory_Aware_Synapses_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Rahaf Aljundi, Francesca Babiloni , Mohamed Elhoseiny, Marcus Rohrbach, Tinne Tuytelaars
Realtime Time Synchronized Event-based Stereo	In this work, we propose a novel event based stereo method which addresses the problem of motion blur for a moving event camera. Our method uses the velocity of the camera and a range of disparities, to synchronize the positions of the events, as if they were captured at a single point in time. We represent these events using a pair of novel time synchronized event disparity volumes, which we show remove motion blur for pixels at the correct disparity in the volume, while further blurring pixels at the wrong disparity. We then apply a novel matching cost over these time synchronized event disparity volumes, which both rewards similarity between the volumes while penalizing blurriness. We show that our method outperforms more expensive, smoothing based event stereo methods, by evaluating on the Multi Vehicle Stereo Event Camera dataset.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Alex_Zhu_Realtime_Time_Synchronized_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Alex Zihao Zhu, Yibo Chen, Kostas Daniilidis
Scaling Egocentric Vision: The EPIC-KITCHENS Dataset	First-person vision is gaining interest as it offers a unique viewpoint on people's interaction with objects, their attention, and even intention. However, progress in this challenging domain has been relatively slow due to the lack of sufficiently large datasets. In this paper, we introduce EPIC-KITCHENS, a large-scale egocentric video benchmark recorded by 32 participants in their native kitchen environments. Our videos depict non-scripted daily activities: we simply asked each participant to start recording every time they entered their kitchen. Recording took place in 4 cities (in North America and Europe) by participants belonging to 10 different nationalities, resulting in highly diverse cooking styles. Our dataset features 55 hours of video consisting of 11.5M frames, which we densely labelled for a total of 39.6K action segments and 454.3K object bounding boxes. Our annotation is unique in that we had the participants narrate their own videos (after recording), thus reflecting true intention, and we crowd-sourced ground-truths based on these. We describe our object, action and anticipation challenges, and evaluate several baselines over two test splits, seen and unseen kitchens.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Dima_Damen_Scaling_Egocentric_Vision_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Dima Damen, Hazel Doughty, Giovanni Maria Farinella, Sanja Fidler, Antonino Furnari, Evangelos Kazakos, Davide Moltisanti, Jonathan Munro, Toby Perrett, Will Price, Michael Wray
Attributes as Operators: Factorizing Unseen Attribute-Object Compositions	We present a new approach to modeling visual attributes. Prior work casts attributes in a similar role as objects, learning a latent representation where properties (e.g., sliced) are recognized by classifiers much in the way objects (e.g., apple) are. However, this common approach fails to separate the attributes observed during training from the objects with which they are composed, making it ineffectual when encountering new attribute-object compositions. Instead, we propose to model attributes as operators. Our approach learns a semantic embedding that explicitly factors out attributes from their accompanying objects, and also benefits from novel regularizers expressing attribute operators' effects (e.g., blunt should undo the effects of sharp). Not only does our approach align conceptually with the linguistic role of attributes as modifiers, but it also generalizes to recognize unseen compositions of objects and attributes, We validate our approach on two challenging datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art. In addition, we show that not only can our model recognize unseen compositions robustly in an open-world setting, it can also generalize to compositions where objects themselves were unseen during training.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tushar_Nagarajan_Attributes_as_Operators_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tushar Nagarajan, Kristen Grauman
Rendering Portraitures from Monocular Camera and Beyond	Shallow Depth-of-Field (DoF) is a desirable effect in photography which renders artistic photos. Usually, it requires single-lens reflex cameras and certain photography skills to generate such effects. Recently, dual-lens on cellphones is used to estimate scene depth and simulate DoF effects for portrait shots. However, this technique cannot be applied to photos already taken and does not work well for whole-body scenes where the subject is at a distance from the cameras. In this work, we introduce an automatic system that achieves portrait DoF rendering for monocular cameras. Specifically, we first exploit Convolutional Neural Networks to estimate the relative depth and portrait segmentation maps from a single input image. Since these initial estimates from a single input are usually coarse and lack fine details, we further learn pixel affinities to refine the coarse estimation maps. With the refined estimation, we conduct depth and segmentation-aware blur rendering to the input image with a Conditional Random Field and image matting. In addition, we train a spatially-variant Recursive Neural Network to learn and accelerate this rendering process. We show that the proposed algorithm can effectively generate portraitures with realistic DoF effects using one single input. Experimental results also demonstrate that our depth and segmentation estimation modules perform favorably against the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiangyu_Xu_Rendering_Portraitures_from_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiangyu Xu, Deqing Sun, Sifei Liu, Wenqi Ren, Yu-Jin Zhang, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Jian Sun
Online Dictionary Learning for Approximate Archetypal Analysis	Archetypal analysis is an unsupervised learning approach which represents data by convex combinations of a set of archetypes. The archetypes generally correspond to the extremal points in the dataset and are learned by requiring them to be convex combinations of the training data. In spite of its nice property of interpretability, the method is slow. We propose a variant of archetypal analysis which scales gracefully to large datasets. The core idea is to decouple the binding between data and archetypes and require them to be unit normalized. Geometrically, the method learns a convex hull inside the unit sphere and represents the data by their projections on the closest surfaces of the convex hull. By minimizing the representation error, the method pushes the convex hull surfaces close to the regions of the sphere where the data reside. The vertices of the convex hull are the learned archetypes. We apply the method to human faces and poses to validate its effectiveness in the context of reconstructions and classifications.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jieru_Mei_Online_Dictionary_Learning_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jieru Mei, Chunyu Wang, Wenjun Zeng
Adversarial Geometry-Aware Human Motion Prediction	We explore an approach to forecasting human motion in a few milliseconds given an input 3D skeleton sequence based on a recurrent encoder-decoder framework. Current approaches suffer from the problem of prediction discontinuities and may fail to predict human-like motion in longer time horizons due to error accumulation. We address these critical issues by incorporating local geometric structure constraints and regularizing predictions with plausible temporal smoothness and continuity from a global perspective. Specifically, rather than using the conventional Euclidean loss, we propose a novel frame-wise geodesic loss as a geometrically meaningful, more precise distance measurement. Moreover, inspired by the adversarial training mechanism, we present a new learning procedure to simultaneously validate the sequence-level plausibility of the prediction and its coherence with the input sequence by introducing two global recurrent discriminators. An unconditional, fidelity discriminator and a conditional, continuity discriminator are jointly trained along with the predictor in an adversarial manner. Our resulting adversarial geometry-aware encoder-decoder (AGED) model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning based approaches on the heavily benchmarked H3.6M dataset in both short-term and long-term predictions.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Liangyan_Gui_Adversarial_Geometry-Aware_Human_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Liang-Yan Gui, Yu-Xiong Wang, Xiaodan Liang, Jose M.

ADVIO: An Authentic Dataset for Visual-Inertial Odometry	The lack of realistic and open benchmarking datasets for pedestrian visual-inertial odometry has made it hard to pinpoint differences in published methods. Existing datasets either lack a full six degree-of-freedom ground-truth or are limited to small spaces with optical tracking systems. We take advantage of advances in pure inertial navigation, and develop a set of versatile and challenging real-world computer vision benchmark sets for visual-inertial odometry. For this purpose, we have built a test rig equipped with an iPhone, a Google Pixel Android phone, and a Google Tango device. We provide a wide range of raw sensor data that is accessible on almost any modern-day smartphone together with a high-quality ground-truth track. We also compare resulting visual-inertial tracks from Google Tango, ARCore, and Apple ARKit with two recent methods published in academic forums. The data sets cover both indoor and outdoor cases, with stairs, escalators, elevators, office environments, a shopping mall, and metro station.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Santiago_Cortes_ADVIO_An_Authentic_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Santiago Cortes, Arno Solin, Esa Rahtu, Juho Kannala
DeepVS: A Deep Learning Based Video Saliency Prediction Approach	In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning based video saliency prediction method, named DeepVS. Specifically, we establish a large-scale eye-tracking database of videos (LEDOV), which includes 32 subjects' fixations on 538 videos. We find from LEDOV that human attention is more likely to be attracted by objects, particularly the moving objects or the moving parts of objects. Hence, an object-to-motion convolutional neural network (OM-CNN) is developed to predict the intra-frame saliency for DeepVS, which is composed of the objectness and motion subnets. In OM-CNN, cross-net mask and hierarchical feature normalization are proposed to combine the spatial features of the objectness subnet and the temporal features of the motion subnet. We further find from our database that there exists a temporal correlation of human attention with a smooth saliency transition across video frames. We thus propose saliency-structured convolutional long short-term memory (SS-ConvLSTM) network, using the extracted features from OM-CNN as the input. Consequently, the inter-frame saliency maps of a video can be generated, which consider both structured output with center-bias and cross-frame transitions of human attention maps. Finally, the experimental results show that DeepVS advances the state-of-the-art in video saliency prediction.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Lai_Jiang_DeepVS_A_Deep_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Lai Jiang, Mai Xu, Tie Liu, Minglang Qiao, Zulin Wang
Learning Compression from Limited Unlabeled Data	Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have dramatically advanced the state-of-art in a number of domains. However, most models are both computation and memory intensive, which arouse the interest of network compression. While existing compression methods achieve good performance, they suffer from three limitations: 1) the inevitable retraining with enormous labeled data; 2) the massive GPU hours for retraining; 3) the training tricks for model compression. Especially the requirement of retraining on original datasets makes it difficult to apply in many real-world scenarios, where training data is not publicly available. In this paper, we reveal that re-normalization is the practical and effective way to alleviate the above limitations. Through quantization or pruning, most methods may compress a large number of parameters but ignore the core role in performance degradation, which is the Gaussian conjugate prior induced by batch normalization. By employing the re-estimated statistics in batch normalization, we significantly improve the accuracy of compressed CNNs. Extensive experiments on ImageNet show it outperforms baselines by a large margin and is comparable to label-based methods. Besides, the fine-tuning process takes less than 5 minutes on CPU, using 1000 unlabeled images.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiangyu_He_Learning_Compression_from_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiangyu He, Jian Cheng
Towards Privacy-Preserving Visual Recognition via Adversarial Training: A Pilot Study	This paper aims to improve privacy-preserving visual recognition, an increasingly demanded feature in smart camera applications, by formulating a unique adversarial training framework. The proposed framework explicitly learns a degradation transform for the original video inputs, in order to optimize the trade-off between target task performance and the associated privacy budgets on the degraded video. A notable challenge is that the privacy budget, often defined and measured in task-driven contexts, cannot be reliably indicated using any single model performance, because a strong protection of privacy has to sustain against any possible model that tries to hack privacy information. Such an uncommon situation has motivated us to propose two strategies to enhance the generalization of the learned degradation on protecting privacy against unseen hacker models. Novel training strategies and evaluation protocols have been designed accordingly. Two experiments on privacy-preserving action recognition, with privacy budgets defined in various ways, manifest the compelling effectiveness of the proposed framework in simultaneously maintaining high target task (action recognition) performance while suppressing the privacy breach risk.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhenyu_Wu_Towards_Privacy-Preserving_Visual_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhenyu Wu, Zhangyang Wang, Zhaowen Wang, Hailin Jin
Motion Feature Network: Fixed Motion Filter for Action Recognition	Spatio-temporal representations in frame sequences play an important role in the task of action recognition. Previously, a method of using optical flow as a temporal information in combination with a set of RGB images that contain spatial information has shown great performance enhancement in the action recognition tasks. However, it has an expensive computational cost and requires two-stream (RGB and optical flow) framework. In this paper, we propose MFNet (Motion Feature Network) containing motion blocks which make it possible to encode spatio-temporal information between adjacent frames in a unified network that can be trained end-to-end. The motion block can be attached to any existing CNN-based action recognition frameworks with only a small additional cost. We evaluated our network on two of the action recognition datasets (Jester and Something-Something) and achieved competitive performances for both datasets by training the networks from scratch.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Myunggi_Lee_Motion_Feature_Network_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Myunggi Lee, Seungeui Lee, Sungjoon Son, Gyutae Park, Nojun Kwak
Using LIP to Gloss Over Faces in Single-Stage Face Detection Networks	This work shows that it is possible to fool/attack recent state-of-the-art face detectors which are based on the single-stage networks. Successfully attacking face detectors could be a serious malware vulnerability when deploying a smart surveillance system utilizing face detectors. In addition, for the privacy concern, it helps prevent faces being harvested and stored in the server. We show that existing adversarial perturbation methods are not effective to perform such an at- tack, especially when there are multiple faces in the input image. This is because the adversarial perturbation specically generated for one face may disrupt the adversarial perturbation for another face. In this paper, we call this problem the Instance Perturbation Interference (IPI) problem. This IPI problem is addressed by studying the relationship between the deep neural network receptive eld and the adversarial perturbation. As such, we propose the Localized Instance Perturbation (LIP) that confines the adversarial perturbation inside the Effective Receptive Field (ERF) of a target to perform the attack. Experimental results show the LIP method massively outperforms existing adversarial perturbation generation methods - often by a factor of 2 to 10.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Siqi_Yang_Using_LIP_to_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Siqi Yang, Arnold Wiliem, Shaokang Chen, Brian C.

Tackling 3D ToF Artifacts Through Learning and the FLAT Dataset	Scene motion, multiple reflections, and sensor noise introduce artifacts in the depth reconstruction performed by time-of-flight cameras. We propose a two-stage, deep-learning approach to address all of these sources of artifacts simultaneously. We also introduce FLAT, a synthetic dataset of 2000 ToF measurements that capture all of these nonidealities, and allows to simulate different camera hardware. Using the Kinect 2 camera as a baseline, we show improved reconstruction errors over state-of-the-art methods, on both simulated and real data.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Qi_Guo_Tackling_3D_ToF_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Qi Guo, Iuri Frosio, Orazio Gallo, Todd Zickler, Jan Kautz
Repeatability Is Not Enough: Learning Affine Regions via Discriminability	A method for learning local affine-covariant regions is presented. We show that maximizing geometric repeatability does not lead to local regions, a.k.a features, that are reliably matched and this necessitates descriptor-based learning. We explore factors that influence such learning and registration: the loss function, descriptor type, geometric parametrization and the trade-off between matchability and geometric accuracy and propose a novel hard negative-constant loss function for learning of affine regions. The affine shape estimator -- AffNet -- trained with the hard negative-constant loss outperforms the state-of-the-art in bag-of-words image retrieval and wide baseline stereo. The proposed training process does not require precisely geometrically aligned patches. The source codes and trained weights are available at https://github.com/ducha-aiki/affnet	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Dmytro_Mishkin_Repeatability_Is_Not_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Dmytro Mishkin, Filip Radenovic, Jiri Matas
Face Recognition with Contrastive Convolution	In current face recognition approaches with convolutional neural network (CNN), a pair of faces to compare are independently fed into the CNN for feature extraction. For both faces the same kernels are applied and hence the representation of a face stays fixed regardless of who it is compared with. As for us humans, however, one generally focuses on varied characteristics of a face when comparing it with distinct persons. Inspired, we propose a novel CNN structure with what we referred to as contrastive convolution, which specifically focuses on the distinct characteristics between the two faces to compare, i.e., those contrastive characteristics. Extensive experiments on the challenging LFW, and IJB-A show that our proposed contrastive convolution significantly improves the vanilla CNN and achieves quite promising performance in face verification task.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chunrui_Han_Face_Recognition_with_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chunrui Han, Shiguang Shan, Meina Kan, Shuzhe Wu, Xilin Chen
Move Forward and Tell: A Progressive Generator of Video Descriptions	We present an efficient framework that can generate a coherent paragraph to describe a given video. Previous works on video captioning usually focus on video clips. They typically treat an entire video as a whole and generate the caption conditioned on a single embedding. On the contrary, we consider videos with rich temporal structures and aim to generate paragraph descriptions that can preserve the story flow while being coherent and concise. Towards this goal, we propose a new approach, which produces a descriptive paragraph by assembling temporally localized descriptions. Given a video, it selects a sequence of distinctive clips and generates sentences thereon in a coherent manner. Particularly, the selection of clips and the production of sentences are done jointly and progressively driven by a recurrent network -- what to describe next depends on what have been said before. Here, the recurrent network is learned via self-critical sequence training with both sentence-level and paragraph-level rewards. On the ActivityNet Captions dataset, our method demonstrated the capability of generating high-quality paragraph descriptions for videos. Compared to those by other methods, the descriptions produced by our method are often more relevant, more coherent, and more concise.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yilei_Xiong_Move_Forward_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yilei Xiong, Bo Dai, Dahua Lin
Joint 3D tracking of a deformable object in interaction with a hand	We present a novel method that is able to track a complex deformable object in interaction with a hand. This is achieved by formulating and solving an optimization problem that jointly considers the hand, the deformable object and the hand/object contact points. The optimization evaluates several hand/object contact configuration hypotheses and adopts the one that results in the best fit of the object's model to the available RGBD observations in the vicinity of the hand. Thus, the hand is not treated as a distractor that occludes parts of the deformable object, but as a source of valuable information. Experimental results on a dataset that has been developed specifically for this new problem illustrate the superior performance of the proposed approach against relevant, state of the art solutions.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Aggeliki_Tsoli_Joint_3D_tracking_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Aggeliki Tsoli, Antonis A.

Quantized Densely Connected U-Nets for Efficient Landmark Localization	In this paper, we propose quantized densely connected U-Nets for efficient visual landmark localization. The idea is that features of the same semantic meanings are globally reused across the stacked U-Nets. This dense connectivity largely improves the information flow, yielding improved localization accuracy. However, a vanilla dense design would suffer from critical efficiency issue in both training and testing. To solve this problem, we first propose order-K dense connectivity to trim off long-distance shortcuts; then, we use a memory-efficient implementation to significantly boost the training efficiency and investigate an iterative refinement that may slice the model size in half. Finally, to reduce the memory consumption and high precision operations both in training and testing, we further quantize weights, inputs, and gradients of our localization network to low bit-width numbers. We validate our approach in two tasks: human pose estimation and face alignment. The results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art localization accuracy, but using ~70% fewer parameters, ~98% less model size and saving ~32x training memory compared with other benchmark localizers.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhiqiang_Tang_Quantized_Densely_Connected_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhiqiang Tang, Xi Peng, Shijie Geng, Lingfei Wu, Shaoting Zhang, Dimitris Metaxas
Shape Reconstruction Using Volume Sweeping and Learned Photoconsistency	The rise of virtual and augmented reality fuels an increased need for content suitable to these new technologies including 3D contents obtained from real scenes. We consider in this paper the problem of 3D shape reconstruction from multi-view RGB images. We investigate the ability of learning-based strategies to effectively benefit the reconstruction of arbitrary shapes with improved precision and robustness. We especially target real life performance capture, containing complex surface details that are difficult to recover with existing approaches. A key step in the multi-view reconstruction pipeline lies in the search for matching features between viewpoints in order to infer depth information. We propose to cast the matching on a 3D receptive field along viewing lines and to learn a multi-view photoconsistency measure for that purpose. The intuition is that deep networks have the ability to learn local photometric configurations in a broad way, even with respect to different orientations along various viewing lines of the same surface point. Our results demonstrate this ability, showing that a CNN, trained on a standard static dataset, can help recover surface details on dynamic scenes that are not perceived by traditional 2D feature based methods. Our evaluation also shows that our solution compares on par to state-of-the-art-reconstruction pipelines on standard evaluation datasets, while yielding significantly better results and generalization with realistic performance capture data.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Vincent_Leroy_Shape_Reconstruction_Using_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Vincent Leroy, Jean-Sebastien Franco, Edmond Boyer
The Sound of Pixels	We introduce PixelPlayer, a system that, by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled videos, learns to locate image regions which produce sounds and separate the input sounds into a set of components that represents the sound from each pixel. Our approach capitalizes on the natural synchronization of the visual and audio modalities to learn models that jointly parse sounds and images, without requiring additional manual supervision. Experimental results on a newly collected MUSIC dataset show that our proposed Mix-and-Separate framework outperforms several baselines on source separation. Qualitative results suggest our model learns to ground sounds in vision, enabling applications such as independently adjusting the volume of sound sources.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hang_Zhao_The_Sound_of_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hang Zhao, Chuang Gan, Andrew Rouditchenko, Carl Vondrick, Josh McDermott, Antonio Torralba
HairNet: Single-View Hair Reconstruction using Convolutional Neural Networks	We introduce a deep learning-based method to generate full 3D hair geometry from an unconstrained image. Our method can recover local strand details and has real-time performance. State-of-the-art hair modeling techniques rely on large hairstyle collections for nearest neighbor retrieval and then perform ad-hoc refinement. Our deep learning approach, in contrast, is highly efficient in storage and can run 1000 times faster while generating hair with 30K strands. The convolutional neural network takes the 2D orientation field of a hair image as input and generates strand features that are evenly distributed on the parameterized 2D scalp. We introduce a collision loss to synthesize more plausible hairstyles, and the visibility of each strand is also used as a weight term to improve the reconstruction accuracy. The encoder-decoder architecture of our network naturally provides a compact and continuous representation for hairstyles, which allows us to interpolate naturally between hairstyles. We use a large set of rendered synthetic hair models to train our network. Our method scales to real images because an intermediate 2D orientation field, automatically calculated from the real image, factors out the difference between synthetic and real hairs. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method on a wide range of challenging real Internet pictures, and show reconstructed hair sequences from videos.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yi_Zhou_Single-view_Hair_Reconstruction_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yi Zhou, Liwen Hu, Jun Xing, Weikai Chen, Han-Wei Kung, Xin Tong, Hao Li
Visual Tracking via Spatially Aligned Correlation Filters Network	Correlation filters based trackers rely on a periodic assumption of the search sample to efficiently distinguish the target from the background. This assumption however yields undesired boundary effects and restricts aspect ratios of search samples. To handle these issues, an end-to-end deep architecture is proposed to incorporate geometric transformations into a correlation filters based network. This architecture introduces a novel spatial alignment module, which provides continuous feedback for transforming the target from the border to the center with a normalized aspect ratio. It enables correlation filters to work on well-aligned samples for better tracking. The whole architecture not only learns a generic relationship between object geometric transformations and object appearances, but also learns robust representations coupled to correlation filters in case of various geometric transformations. This lightweight architecture permits real-time speed. Experiments show our tracker effectively handles boundary effects and aspect ratio variations, achieving state-of-the-art tracking results on three benchmarks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/mengdan_zhang_Visual_Tracking_via_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Mengdan Zhang, Qiang Wang, Junliang Xing, Jin Gao, Peixi Peng, Weiming Hu, Steve Maybank
Jointly Discovering Visual Objects and Spoken Words from Raw Sensory Input	In this paper, we explore neural network models that learn to associate segments of spoken audio captions with the semantically relevant portions of natural images that they refer to. We demonstrate that these audio-visual associative localizations emerge from network-internal representations learned as a by-product of training to perform an image-audio retrieval task. Our models operate directly on the image pixels and speech waveform, and do not rely on any conventional supervision in the form of labels, segmentations, or alignments between the modalities during training. We perform analysis using the Places 205 and ADE20k datasets demonstrating that our models implicitly learn semantically-coupled object and word detectors.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/David_Harwath_Jointly_Discovering_Visual_ECCV_2018_paper.php	David Harwath, Adria Recasens, Didac Suris, Galen Chuang, Antonio Torralba, James Glass
Associating Inter-Image Salient Instances for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation	Effectively bridging between image level keyword annotations and corresponding image pixels is one of the main challenges in weakly supervised semantic segmentation. In this paper, we use an instance-level salient object detector to automatically generate salient instances (candidate objects) for training images. Using similarity features extracted from each salient instance in the whole training set, we build a similarity graph, then use a graph partitioning algorithm to separate it into multiple subgraphs, each of which is associated with a single keyword (tag). Our graph-partitioning-based clustering algorithm allows us to consider the relationships between all salient instances in the training set as well as the information within them. We further show that with the help of attention information, our clustering algorithm is able to correct certain wrong assignments, leading to more accurate results. The proposed framework is general, and any state-of-the-art fully-supervised network structure can be incorporated to learn the segmentation network. When working with DeepLab for semantic segmentation, our method outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised alternatives by a large margin, achieving 65.6% mIoU on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. We also combine our method with Mask R-CNN for instance segmentation, and demonstrated for the first time the ability of weakly supervised instance segmentation using only keyword annotations.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ruochen_Fan_Associating_Inter-Image_Salient_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ruochen Fan, Qibin Hou, Ming-Ming Cheng, Gang Yu, Ralph R.

Propagating LSTM: 3D Pose Estimation based on Joint Interdependency	We present a novel 3D pose estimation method based on joint interdependency (JI) for acquiring 3D joints from the human pose of an RGB image. The JI incorporates the body part based structural connectivity of joints to learn the high spatial correlation of human posture on our method. Towards this goal, we propose a new long short-term memory (LSTM)-based deep learning architecture named propagating LSTM networks (p-LSTMs), where each LSTM is connected sequentially to reconstruct 3D depth from the centroid to edge joints through learning the intrinsic JI. In the first LSTM, the seed joints of 3D pose are created and reconstructed into the whole-body joints through the connected LSTMs. Utilizing the p-LSTMs, we achieve the higher accuracy of about 11.2% than state-of-the-art methods on the largest publicly available database. Importantly, we demonstrate that the JI drastically reduces the structural errors at body edges, thereby leads to a significant improvement.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Kyoungoh_Lee_Propagating_LSTM_3D_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Kyoungoh Lee, Inwoong Lee, Sanghoon Lee
Practical Black-box Attacks on Deep Neural Networks using Efficient Query Mechanisms	"Existing black-box attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs) have largely focused on transferability, where an adversarial instance generated for a locally trained model can ""transfer"" to attack other learning models. In this paper, we propose novel Gradient Estimation black-box attacks for adversaries with query access to the target model's class probabilities, which do not rely on transferability. We also propose strategies to decouple the number of queries required to generate each adversarial sample from the dimensionality of the input. An iterative variant of our attack achieves close to 100% attack success rates for both targeted and untargeted attacks on DNNs. We carry out a thorough comparative evaluation of black-box attacks and show that Gradient Estimation attacks achieve attack success rates similar to state-of-the-art white-box attacks on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. We also apply the Gradient Estimation attacks successfully against real-world classifiers hosted by Clarifai. Further, we evaluate black-box attacks against state-of-the-art defenses based on adversarial training and show that the Gradient Estimation attacks are very effective even against these defenses."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Arjun_Nitin_Bhagoji_Practical_Black-box_Attacks_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Arjun Nitin Bhagoji, Warren He, Bo Li, Dawn Song
Deterministic Consensus Maximization with Biconvex Programming	Consensus maximization is one of the most widely used robust fitting paradigms in computer vision, and the development of algorithms for consensus maximization is an active research topic. In this paper, we propose an efficient deterministic optimization algorithm for consensus maximization. Given an initial solution, our method conducts a deterministic search that forcibly increases the consensus of the initial solution. We show how each iteration of the update can be formulated as an instance of biconvex programming, which we solve efficiently using a novel biconvex optimization algorithm. In contrast to our algorithm, previous consensus improvement techniques rely on random sampling or relaxations of the objective function, which reduce their ability to significantly improve the initial consensus. In fact, on challenging instances, the previous techniques may even return a worse off solution. Comprehensive experiments show that our algorithm can consistently and greatly improve the quality of the initial solution, without substantial cost.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhipeng_Cai_Deterministic_Consensus_Maximization_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhipeng Cai, Tat-Jun Chin, Huu Le, David Suter
Learning to Dodge A Bullet: Concyclic View Morphing via Deep Learning	"The bullet-time effect, presented in feature film ``The Matrix"", has been widely adopted in feature films and TV commercials to create an amazing stopping-time illusion. Producing such visual effects, however, typically requires using a large number of cameras/images surrounding the subject. In this paper, we present a learning-based solution that is capable of producing the bullet-time effect from only a small set of images. Specifically, we present a view morphing framework that can synthesize smooth and realistic transitions along extit{a circular view path} using as few as three reference images. We apply a novel cyclic rectification technique to align the reference images onto a common circle and then feed the rectified results into a deep network to predict its motion field and per-pixel visibility for new view interpolation. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real data show that our new framework outperforms the state-of-the-art and provides an inexpensive and practical solution for producing the bullet-time effects."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/shi_jin_Learning_to_Dodge_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Shi Jin, Ruiynag Liu, Yu Ji, Jinwei Ye, Jingyi Yu
Mask TextSpotter: An End-to-End Trainable Neural Network for Spotting Text with Arbitrary Shapes	Recently, models based on deep neural networks have dominated the fields of scene text detection and recognition. In this paper, we investigate the problem of scene text spotting, which aims at simultaneous text detection and recognition in natural images. An end-to-end trainable neural network model for scene text spotting is proposed. The proposed model, named as Mask TextSpotter, is inspired by the newly published work Mask R-CNN. Different from previous methods that also accomplish text spotting with end-to-end trainable deep neural networks, Mask TextSpotter takes advantage of simple and smooth end-to-end learning procedure, in which precise text detection and recognition are acquired via semantic segmentation. Moreover, it is superior to previous methods in handling text instances of irregular shapes, for example, curved text. Experiments on ICDAR2013, ICDAR2015 and Total-Text demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in both scene text detection and end-to-end text recognition tasks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Pengyuan_Lyu_Mask_TextSpotter_An_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Pengyuan Lyu, Minghui Liao, Cong Yao, Wenhao Wu, Xiang Bai
Super-Resolution and Sparse View CT Reconstruction	We present a flexible framework for robust computed tomography (CT) reconstruction with a specific emphasis on recovering thin 1D and 2D manifolds embedded in 3D volumes. To reconstruct such structures at resolutions below the Nyquist limit of the CT image sensor, we devise a new 3D structure tensor prior, which can be incorporated as a regularizer into more traditional proximal optimization methods for CT reconstruction. As a second, smaller contribution, we also show that when using such a proximal reconstruction framework, it is beneficial to employ the Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (SART) instead of the commonly used Conjugate Gradient (CG) method in the solution of the data term proximal operator. We show empirically that CG often does not converge to the global optimum for tomography problem even though the underlying problem is convex. We demonstrate that using SART provides better reconstruction results in sparse-view settings using fewer projection images. We provide extensive experimental results for both contributions on both simulated and real data. Moreover, our code will also be made publicly available.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Guangming_Zang_Super-Resolution_and_Sparse_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Guangming Zang, Mohamed Aly, Ramzi Idoughi, Peter Wonka, Wolfgang Heidrich
Deep Regression Tracking with Shrinkage Loss	Regression trackers directly learn a mapping from regularly dense samples of target objects to soft labels, which are usually generated by a Gaussian function, to estimate target positions. Due to the potential for fast-tracking and easy implementation, regression trackers have received increasing attention recently. However, state-of-the-art deep regression trackers do not perform as well as discriminative correlation filters (DCFs) trackers. We identify the main bottleneck of training regression networks as extreme foreground-background data imbalance. To balance training data, we propose a novel shrinkage loss to penalize the importance of easy training data. Additionally, we apply residual connections to fuse multiple convolutional layers as well as their output response maps. Without bells and whistles, the proposed deep regression tracking method performs favorably against state-of-the-art trackers, especially in comparison with DCFs trackers, on five benchmark datasets including OTB-2013, OTB-2015, Temple-128, UAV-123 and VOT-2016.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiankai_Lu_Deep_Regression_Tracking_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiankai Lu, Chao Ma, Bingbing Ni, Xiaokang Yang, Ian Reid, Ming-Hsuan Yang
Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network with Recurrent Attention Residual Modules for Shadow Detection	This paper presents a network to detect shadows by exploring and combining global context in deep layers and local context in shallow layers of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). There are two technical contributions in our network design. First, we formulate the recurrent attention residual (RAR) module to combine the contexts in two adjacent CNN layers and learn an attention map to select a residual and then refine the context features. Second, we develop a bidirectional feature pyramid network (BFPN) to aggregate shadow contexts spanned across different CNN layers by deploying two series of RAR modules in the network to iteratively combine and refine context features: one series to refine context features from deep to shallow layers, and another series from shallow to deep layers. Hence, we can better suppress false detections and enhance shadow details at the same time. We evaluate our network on two common shadow detection benchmark datasets: SBU and UCF. Experimental results show that our network outperforms the best existing method with 34.88% reduction on SBU and 34.57% reduction on UCF for the balance error rate.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Lei_Zhu_Bi-directional_Feature_Pyramid_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Lei Zhu, Zijun Deng, Xiaowei Hu, Chi-Wing Fu, Xuemiao Xu, Jing Qin, Pheng-Ann Heng
DeepWrinkles: Accurate and Realistic Clothing Modeling	We present a novel method to generate accurate and realistic clothing deformation from real data capture. Previous methods for realistic cloth modeling mainly rely on intensive computation of physics-based simulation (with numerous heuristic parameters), while models reconstructed from visual observations typically suffer from lack of geometric details. Here, we propose an original framework consisting of two modules that work jointly to represent global shape deformation as well as surface details with high fidelity. Global shape deformations are recovered from a subspace model learned from 3D data of clothed people in motion, while high frequency details are added to normal maps created using a conditional Generative Adversarial Network whose architecture is designed to enforce realism and temporal consistency. This leads to unprecedented high-quality rendering of clothing deformation sequences, where fine wrinkles from (real) high resolution observations can be recovered. In addition, as the model is learned independently from body shape and pose, the framework is suitable for applications that require retargeting (e.g., body animation). Our experiments show original high quality results with a flexible model. We claim an entirely data-driven approach to realistic cloth wrinkle generation is possible.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zorah_Laehner_DeepWrinkles_Accurate_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zorah Lahner, Daniel Cremers, Tony Tung
CubeNet: Equivariance to 3D Rotation and Translation	3D Convolutional Neural Networks are sensitive to transformations applied to their input. This is a problem because a voxelized version of a 3D object, and its rotated clone, will look unrelated to each other after passing through to the last layer of a network. Instead, an idealized model would preserve a meaningful representation of the voxelized object, while explaining the pose-difference between the two inputs. An equivariant representation vector has two components: the invariant identity part, and a discernable encoding of the transformation. Models that can't explain pose-differences risk ``diluting'' the representation, in pursuit of optimizing a classification or regression loss function. We introduce a Group Convolutional Neural Network with linear equivariance to translations and right angle rotations in three dimensions. We call this network CubeNet, reflecting its cube-like symmetry. By construction, this network helps preserve a 3D shape's global and local signature, as it is transformed through successive layers. We apply this network to a variety of 3D inference problems, achieving state-of-the-art on the ModelNet10 classification challenge, and comparable performance on the ISBI 2012 Connectome Segmentation Benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 3D rotation equivariant CNN for voxel representations.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Daniel_Worrall_CubeNet_Equivariance_to_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Daniel Worrall, Gabriel Brostow
Rethinking the Form of Latent States in Image Captioning	Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or their variants, e.g. GRU and LSTM, have been widely adopted for image captioning. In an RNN, the production of a caption is driven by a sequence of latent states. Existing captioning models usually represent latent states as vectors, taking this practice for granted. In our work, we rethink this choice and study an alternative formulation, namely using two-dimensional maps to encode latent states and convolution for state transformation. This is motivated by the curiosity about a question: how are the spatial structures in the latent states related to the resultant captions? Our study on MSCOCO [1] and Flickr30k [2] leads to two significant observations. First, the formulation with 2D states is generally more effective in captioning, consistently achieving higher performance with comparable parameter sizes. Second, 2D states preserve spatial locality. Taking advantage of this, we derive a simple scheme that can visually reveal the internal dynamics in the process of caption generation, as well as the connections between input visual domain and output linguistic domain.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Bo_Dai_Rethinking_the_Form_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Bo Dai, Deming Ye, Dahua Lin
Find and Focus: Retrieve and Localize Video Events with Natural Language Queries	The thriving of video sharing services brings new challenges to video retrieval, e.g. the rapid growth in video duration and content diversity. Meeting such challenges calls for new techniques that can effectively retrieve videos with natural language queries. Existing methods along this line, which mostly rely on embedding videos as a whole, remain far from satisfactory for real-world applications due to the limited expressive power. In this work, we aim to move beyond this limitation by delving into the internal structures of both sides, the queries and the videos. Specifically, we propose a new framework called Find and Focus (FIFO), which not only performs top-level matching (paragraph vs. video), but also makes part-level associations, localizing a video clip for each sentence in the query with the help of a focusing guide. These levels are complementary - the top-level matching narrows the search while the part-level localization refines the results. On both ActivityNet Captions and modified LSMDC datasets, the proposed framework achieves remarkable performance gains.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Dian_SHAO_Find_and_Focus_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Dian Shao, Yu Xiong, Yue Zhao, Qingqiu Huang, Yu Qiao, Dahua Lin
Programmable Triangulation Light Curtains	A vehicle on a road or a robot in the field does not need a full-featured 3D depth sensor to detect potential collisions or monitor its blind spot. Instead, it needs to only monitor if any object comes within its near proximity which is an easier task than full depth scanning. We introduce a novel device that monitors the presence of objects on a virtual shell near the device, which we refer to as a light curtain. Light curtains offer a light-weight, resource-efficient and programmable approach to proximity awareness for obstacle avoidance and navigation. They also have additional benefits in terms of improving visibility in fog as well as flexibility in handling light fall-off. Our prototype for generating light curtains works by rapidly rotating a line sensor and a line laser, in synchrony. The device is capable of generating light curtains of various shapes with a range of 20-30m in sunlight (40m under cloudy skies and 50m indoors) and adapts dynamically to the demands of the task. We analyze properties of light curtains and various approaches to optimize their thickness as well as power requirements. We showcase the potential of light curtains using a range of real-world scenarios.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jian_Wang_Programmable_Light_Curtains_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jian Wang, Joseph Bartels, William Whittaker, Aswin C.

Towards Robust Neural Networks via Random Self-ensemble	Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of deep neural networks - A small adversarial perturbation that is imperceptible to human can easily make a well-trained deep neural network misclassify. This makes it unsafe to apply neural networks in security-critical applications. In this paper, we propose a new defense algorithm called Random Self-Ensemble (RSE) by combining two important concepts: {f randomness} and {f ensemble}. To protect a targeted model, RSE adds random noise layers to the neural network to prevent the strong gradient-based attacks, and ensembles the prediction over random noises to stabilize the performance. We show that our algorithm is equivalent to ensemble an infinite number of noisy models $f_epsilon$ without any additional memory overhead, and the proposed training procedure based on noisy stochastic gradient descent can ensure the ensemble model has a good predictive capability. Our algorithm significantly outperforms previous defense techniques on real data sets. For instance, on CIFAR-10 with VGG network (which has 92% accuracy without any attack), under the strong C&W attack within a certain distortion tolerance, the accuracy of unprotected model drops to less than 10%, the best previous defense technique has $48%$ accuracy, while our method still has $86%$ prediction accuracy under the same level of attack. Finally, our method is simple and easy to integrate into any neural network.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xuanqing_Liu_Towards_Robust_Neural_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xuanqing Liu, Minhao Cheng, Huan Zhang, Cho-Jui Hsieh
Joint Learning of Intrinsic Images and Semantic Segmentation	Semantic segmentation of outdoor scenes is problematic when there are variations in imaging conditions. It is known that albedo (reflectance) is invariant to all kinds of illumination effects. Thus, using reflectance images for semantic segmentation task can be favorable. Additionally, not only segmentation may benefit from reflectance, but also segmentation may be useful for reflectance computation. Therefore, in this paper, the tasks of semantic segmentation and intrinsic image decomposition are considered as a combined process by exploring their mutual relationship in a joint fashion. To that end, we propose a supervised end-to-end CNN architecture to jointly learn intrinsic image decomposition and semantic segmentation. We analyze the gains of addressing those two problems jointly. Moreover, new cascade CNN architectures for intrinsic-for-segmentation and segmentation-for-intrinsic are proposed as single tasks. Furthermore, a dataset of 35K synthetic images of natural environments is created with corresponding albedo and shading (intrinsics), as well as semantic labels (segmentation) assigned to each object/scene. The experiments show that joint learning of intrinsic image decomposition and semantic segmentation is beneficial for both tasks for natural scenes.

Predicting Gaze in Egocentric Video by Learning Task-dependent Attention Transition	We present a new computational model for gaze prediction in egocentric videos by exploring patterns in temporal shift of gaze fixations (attention transition) that are dependent on egocentric manipulation tasks. Our assumption is that the high-level context of how a task is completed in a certain way has a strong influence on attention transition and should be modeled for gaze prediction in natural dynamic scenes. Specifically, we propose a hybrid model based on deep neural networks which integrates task-dependent attention transition with bottom-up saliency prediction. In particular, the task-dependent attention transition is learned with a recurrent neural network to exploit the temporal context of gaze fixations, e.g., looking at a cup after moving gaze away from a grasped bottle. Experiments on public egocentric activity datasets show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art gaze prediction methods and is able to learn meaningful transition of human attention.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Huang_Predicting_Gaze_in_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yifei Huang, Minjie Cai, Zhenqiang Li, Yoichi Sato
Single Image Water Hazard Detection using FCN with Reflection Attention Units	Water bodies, such as puddles and flooded areas, on and off road pose significant risks to autonomous cars. Detecting water from moving camera is a challenging task as water surface is highly refractive, and its appearance varies with viewing angle, surrounding scene, weather conditions. In this paper, we present a water puddle detection method based on a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) with our newly proposed Reflection Attention Units (RAUs). An RAU is a deep network unit designed to embody the physics of reflection on water surface from sky and nearby scene. To verify the performance of our proposed method, we collect 11455 color stereo images with polarizers, and 985 of left images are annotated and divided into 2 datasets: On Road (ONR) dataset and Off Road (OFR) dataset. We show that FCN-8s with RAUs improves significantly precision and recall metrics as compared to FCN-8s, DeepLab V2 and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We also show that focal loss function can improve the performance of FCN-8s network due to the extreme imbalance of water versus ground classification problem.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiaofeng_Han_Single_Image_Water_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiaofeng Han, Chuong Nguyen, Shaodi You, Jianfeng Lu
Progressive Neural Architecture Search	We propose a new method for learning the structure of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that is more efficient than recent state-of-the-art methods based on reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms. Our approach uses a sequential model-based optimization (SMBO) strategy, in which we search for structures in order of increasing complexity, while simultaneously learning a surrogate model to guide the search through structure space. Direct comparison under the same search space shows that our method is up to 5 times more efficient than the RL method of Zoph et al. (2018) in terms of number of models evaluated, and 8 times faster in terms of total compute. The structures we discover in this way achieve state of the art classification accuracies on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chenxi_Liu_Progressive_Neural_Architecture_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chenxi Liu, Barret Zoph, Maxim Neumann, Jonathon Shlens, Wei Hua, Li-Jia Li, Li Fei-Fei, Alan Yuille, Jonathan Huang, Kevin Murphy
Urban Zoning Using Higher-Order Markov Random Fields on Multi-View Imagery Data	Urban zoning enables various applications in land use analysis and urban planning. As cities evolve, it is important to constantly update the zoning maps of cities to reflect urban pattern changes. This paper proposes a method for automatic urban zoning using higher-order Markov random fields (HO-MRF) built on multi-view imagery data including street-view photos and top-view satellite images. In the proposed HO-MRF, top-view satellite data is segmented via a multi-scale deep convolutional neural network (MS-CNN) and used in lower-order potentials. Street-view data with geo-tagged information is augmented in higher-order potentials. Various feature types for classifying street-view images were also investigated in our work. We evaluated the proposed method on a number of famous metropolises and provided in-depth analysis on technical issues.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tian_Feng_Urban_Zoning_Using_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tian Feng, Quang-Trung Truong, Duc Thanh Nguyen, Jing Yu Koh, Lap-Fai Yu, Alexander Binder, Sai-Kit Yeung
Lifelong Learning via Progressive Distillation and Retrospection	Lifelong learning aims at adapting a learned model to new tasks while retaining the knowledge gained earlier. A key challenge for lifelong learning is how to strike a balance between the preservation on old tasks and the adaptation to a new one within a given model. Approaches that combine both objectives in training have been explored in previous works. Yet the performance still suffers from considerable degradation in a long sequence of tasks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to lifelong learning, which tries to seek a better balance between preservation and adaptation via two techniques: Distillation and Retrospection. Specifically, the target model adapts to the new task by knowledge distillation from an intermediate expert, while the previous knowledge is more effectively preserved by caching a small subset of data for old tasks. The combination of Distillation and Retrospection leads to a more gentle learning curve for the target model, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can bring consistent improvements on both old and new tasks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Saihui_Hou_Progressive_Lifelong_Learning_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Saihui Hou, Xinyu Pan, Chen Change Loy, Zilei Wang, Dahua Lin
Is Robustness the Cost of Accuracy? -- A Comprehensive Study on the Robustness of 18 Deep Image Classification Models	The prediction accuracy has been the long-lasting and sole standard for comparing the performance of different image classification models, including the ImageNet competition. However, recent studies have highlighted the lack of robustness in well-trained deep neural networks to adversarial examples. Visually imperceptible perturbations to natural images can easily be crafted and mislead the image classifiers towards misclassification. To demystify the trade-offs between robustness and accuracy, in this paper we thoroughly benchmark 18 ImageNet models using multiple robustness metrics, including the distortion, success rate and transferability of adversarial examples between 306 pairs of models. Our extensive experimental results reveal several new insights: (1) linear scaling law - the empirical $ell_2$ and $ell_infty$ distortion metrics scale linearly with the $log$ value of classification error; (2) model architecture is a more critical factor to robustness than model size, and the disclosed accuracy-robustness Pareto frontier can be used as an evaluation criterion for ImageNet model designers; (3) for a similar network architecture, increasing network depth slightly improves robustness in $ell_infty$ distortion; (4) there exist models (in VGG family) that exhibit high adversarial transferability, while most adversarial examples crafted from one model can only be transferred within the same family. Experiment code is publicly available at url{https://github.com/huanzhang12/Adversarial_Survey}.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Dong_Su_Is_Robustness_the_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Dong Su, Huan Zhang, Hongge Chen, Jinfeng Yi, Pin-Yu Chen, Yupeng Gao
Deep Clustering for Unsupervised Learning of Visual Features	Clustering is a class of unsupervised learning methods that has been extensively applied and studied in computer vision. Little work has been done to adapt it to the end-to-end training of visual features on large-scale datasets. In this work, we present DeepCluster, a clustering method that jointly learns the parameters of a neural network and the cluster assignments of the resulting features. DeepCluster iteratively groups the features with a standard clustering algorithm, k-means, and uses the subsequent assignments as supervision to update the weights of the network. We apply DeepCluster to the unsupervised training of convolutional neural networks on large datasets like ImageNet and YFCC100M. The resulting model outperforms the current state of the art by a significant margin on all the standard benchmarks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Mathilde_Caron_Deep_Clustering_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Mathilde Caron, Piotr Bojanowski, Armand Joulin, Matthijs Douze
Synthetically Supervised Feature Learning for Scene Text Recognition	"We address the problem of image feature learning for scene text recognition. The image features in the state-of-the-art methods are learned from large-scale synthetic image datasets. However, most methods only rely on outputs of the synthetic data generation process, namely realistically looking images, and completely ignore the rest of the process. We propose to leverage the parameters that lead to the output images to improve image feature learning. Specifically, for every image out of the data generation process, we obtain the associated parameters and render another ""clean"" image that is free of select distortion factors that are applied to the output image. Because of the absence of distortion factors, the clean image tends to be easier to recognize than the original image. We design a multi-task network with an encoder-discriminator-generator architecture to guide the feature of the original image toward that of the clean image. The experiments show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on standard scene text recognition benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that without explicitly handling, our method works on challenging cases where input images contain severe geometric distortion, such as text on a curved path."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yang_Liu_Synthetically_Supervised_Feature_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yang Liu, Zhaowen Wang, Hailin Jin, Ian Wassell
View-graph Selection Framework for SfM	View-graph is an essential input to large-scale structure from motion (SfM) pipelines. Accuracy and efficiency of large-scale SfM is crucially dependent on the input view-graph. Inconsistent or inaccurate edges can lead to inferior or wrong reconstruction. Most SfM methods remove `undesirable' images and pairs using several fixed heuristic criteria, and propose tailor-made solutions to achieve specific reconstruction objectives such as efficiency, accuracy, or disambiguation. In contrast to these disparate solutions, we propose an optimization based formulation that can be used to achieve these different reconstruction objectives with task-specific cost modeling that uses and construct a very efficient network flow based formulation for its approximate solution. The abstraction brought on by this selection mechanism separates the challenges specific to datasets and reconstruction objectives from the standard SfM pipeline and improves its generalization. This paper mainly focuses on application of this framework with standard SfM pipeline for accurate and ghost-free reconstructions of highly ambiguous datasets. To model selection costs for this task, we introduce new disambiguation priors based on local geometry. We further demonstrate versatility of the method by using it for the general objective of accurate and efficient reconstruction of large-scale Internet datasets using costs based on well-known SfM priors.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Rajvi_Shah_View-graph_Selection_Framework_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Rajvi Shah, Visesh Chari, P J Narayanan
A Joint Sequence Fusion Model for Video Question Answering and Retrieval	We present an approach named JSFusion (Joint Sequence Fusion) that can measure semantic similarity between any pairs of multimodal sequence data (e.g. a video sequence and a language sentence). Our idea is to learn an effective multimodal matching network for sequence data, consisting of two key components. First the Joint Semantic Tensor embeds the joint representation of two sequence data, and then the Convolutional Hierarchical Decoder computes a matching score or predicts a word as an answer to a question, by discovering hidden hierarchical joint relations of two sequence modalities. Both modules leverage a attention mechanism to promote well-matched representation patterns while prune out misaligned ones in a bottom-up manner. Although the JSFusion is a universal model to be applicable to any multimodal sequence data, we focus on video-language tasks including multimodal retrieval and video QA. For evaluation of our JSFusion model, we evaluate our model in three VQA and retrieval tasks in LSMDC, for which our model achieves the best performance with significant margins. We also perform multiple-choice and movie retrieval tasks for the MSR-VTT dataset, on which our approach also outperforms many state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Youngjae_Yu_A_Joint_Sequence_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Youngjae Yu , Jongseok Kim , Gunhee Kim
Deep Factorised Inverse-Sketching	Modelling human free-hand sketches has become topical recently, driven by practical applications such as fine-grained sketch based image retrieval (FG-SBIR). Sketches are clearly related to photo edge-maps, but a human free-hand sketch of a photo is not simply a clean rendering of that photo's edge map. Instead there is a fundamental process of abstraction and iconic rendering, where overall geometry is warped and salient details are selectively included. In this paper we study this sketching process and attempt to invert it. We model this inversion by translating iconic free-hand sketches to contours that resemble more geometrically realistic projections of object boundaries, and separately factorise out the salient added details. This factorised re-representation makes it easier to match a free-hand sketch to a photo instance of an object. Specifically, we propose a novel unsupervised image style transfer model based on enforcing a cyclic embedding consistency constraint. A deep FG-SBIR model is then formulated to accommodate complementary discriminative detail from each factorised sketch for better matching with the corresponding photo. Our method is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively to demonstrate its superiority over a number of state-of-the-art alternatives for style transfer and FG-SBIR.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Kaiyue_Pang_Deep_Factorised_Inverse-Sketching_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Kaiyue Pang, Da Li, Jifei Song, Yi-Zhe Song, Tao Xiang, Timothy M.

In the Eye of Beholder: Joint Learning of Gaze and Actions in First Person Video	We address the task of jointly determining what a person is doing and where they are looking based on the analysis of video captured by a headworn camera. We propose a novel deep model for joint gaze estimation and action recognition in First Person Vision. Our method describes the participant's gaze as a probabilistic variable and models its distribution using stochastic units in a deep network. We sample from these stochastic units to generate an attention map. This attention map guides the aggregation of visual features in action recognition, thereby providing coupling between gaze and action. We evaluate our method on the standard EGTEA dataset and demonstrate performance that exceeds the state-of-the-art by a significant margin of 3.5%.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yin_Li_In_the_Eye_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yin Li, Miao Liu, James M.

Object Level Visual Reasoning in Videos	Human activity recognition is typically addressed by training models to detect key concepts like global and local motion, features related to object classes present in the scene, as well as features related to the global context. The next open challenges in activity recognition require a level of understanding that pushes beyond this, requiring fine distinctions and a detailed comprehension of the interactions between actors and objects in a scene. We propose a model capable of learning to reason about semantically meaningful spatio-temporal interactions in videos. Key to our approach is the choice of performing this reasoning on an object level through the integration of state of the art object instance segmentation networks. This allows the model to learn detailed spatial interactions that exist at a semantic, object-interaction relevant level. We evaluated our method on three standard datasets: the Twenty-BN Something-Something dataset, the VLOG dataset and the EPIC Kitchens dataset, and achieve state of the art results on both. Finally, we also show visualizations of the interactions learned by the model, which illustrate object classes and their interactions corresponding to different activity classes.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Fabien_Baradel_Object_Level_Visual_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Fabien Baradel, Natalia Neverova, Christian Wolf, Julien Mille, Greg Mori
Deep Co-Training for Semi-Supervised Image Recognition	In this paper, we study the problem of semi-supervised image recognition, which is to learn classifiers using both labeled and unlabeled images. We present Deep Co-Training, a deep learning based method inspired by the Co-Training framework. The original Co-Training learns two classifiers on two views which are data from different sources that describe the same instances. To extend this concept to deep learning, Deep Co-Training trains multiple deep neural networks to be the different views and exploits adversarial examples to encourage view difference, in order to prevent the networks from collapsing into each other. As a result, the co-trained networks provide different and complementary information about the data, which is necessary for the Co-Training framework to achieve good results. We test our method on SVHN, CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets, and our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Siyuan_Qiao_Deep_Co-Training_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Siyuan Qiao, Wei Shen, Zhishuai Zhang, Bo Wang, Alan Yuille
Conditional Image-Text Embedding Networks	This paper presents an approach for grounding phrases in images which jointly learns multiple text-conditioned embeddings in a single end-to-end model. In order to differentiate text phrases into semantically distinct subspaces, we propose a concept weight branch that automatically assigns phrases to embeddings, whereas prior works predefine such assignments. Our proposed solution simplifies the representation requirements for individual embeddings and allows the underrepresented concepts to take advantage of the shared representations before feeding them into concept-specific layers. Comprehensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our approach across three phrase grounding datasets, Flickr30K Entities, ReferIt Game, and Visual Genome, where we obtain a (resp.) 4%, 3%, and 4% improvement in grounding performance over a strong region-phrase embedding baseline.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Bryan_Plummer_Conditional_Image-Text_Embedding_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Bryan A.

Group Normalization	Batch Normalization (BN) is a milestone technique in the development of deep learning, enabling various networks to train. However, normalizing along the batch dimension introduces problems --- BN's error increases rapidly when the batch size becomes smaller, caused by inaccurate batch statistics estimation. This limits BN's usage for training larger models and transferring features to computer vision tasks including detection, segmentation, and video, which require small batches constrained by memory consumption. In this paper, we present Group Normalization (GN) as a simple alternative to BN. GN divides the channels into groups and computes within each group the mean and variance for normalization. GN's computation is independent of batch sizes, and its accuracy is stable in a wide range of batch sizes. On ResNet-50 trained in ImageNet, GN has 10.6% lower error than its BN counterpart when using a batch size of 2; when using typical batch sizes, GN is comparably good with BN and outperforms other normalization variants. Moreover, GN can be naturally transferred from pre-training to fine-tuning. GN can outperform its BN-based counterparts for object detection and segmentation in COCO, and for video classification in Kinetics, showing that GN can effectively replace the powerful BN in a variety of tasks. GN can be easily implemented by a few lines of code.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yuxin_Wu_Group_Normalization_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yuxin Wu, Kaiming He
Semi-supervised FusedGAN for Conditional Image Generation	We present FusedGAN, a deep network for conditional image synthesis with controllable sampling of diverse images. Fidelity, diversity and controllable sampling are the main quality measures of a good image generation model. Most existing models are insufficient in all three aspects. The FusedGAN can perform controllable sampling of diverse images with very high fidelity. We argue that controllability can be achieved by disentangling the generation process into various stages. In contrast to stacked GANs, where multiple stages of GANs are trained separately with full supervision of labeled intermediate images, the FusedGAN has a single stage pipeline with a built-in stacking of GANs. Also another limitation of the existing methods is that they require fully supervised training data in the form of paired condition and image. For tasks such as text-to-image generation, the limited size of such fully supervised, paired training datasets may easily cause mode collapsing in training, which confronts the generation of diverse samples. Unlike existing methods, which requires full supervision with paired conditions and images, the FusedGAN can effectively leverage more abundant images without corresponding conditions in training, to produce more diverse samples with high fidelity. We achieve this by fusing two generators: one for unconditional image generation, and the other for conditional image generation, where the two partly share a common latent space thereby disentangling the generation. We demonstrate the efficacy of the FusedGAN in fine grained image generation tasks such as text-to-image, and attribute-to-face generation.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Navaneeth_Bodla_Semi-supervised_FusedGAN_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Navaneeth Bodla, Gang Hua, Rama Chellappa
FishEyeRecNet: A Multi-Context Collaborative Deep Network for Fisheye Image Rectification	Images captured by sheye lenses violate the pinhole camera assumption and suer from distortions. Rectication of sheye images is therefore a crucial preprocessing step for many computer vision applications. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end multi-context collaborative deep network for removing distortions from single sheye images. In contrast to conventional approaches, which focus on extracting hand-crafted features from input images, our method learns high-level semantics and low-level appearance features simultaneously to estimate the distortion parameters. To facilitate training, we construct a synthesized dataset that covers various scenes and distortion parameter settings. Experiments on both synthesized and real-world datasets show that the proposed model signicantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Our code and synthesized dataset will be made publicly available.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiaoqing_Yin_FishEyeRecNet_A_Multi-Context_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiaoqing Yin, Xinchao Wang, Jun Yu, Maojun Zhang, Pascal Fua, Dacheng Tao
Visual-Inertial Object Detection and Mapping	We present a method to populate an unknown environment with models of previously seen objects, placed in a Euclidean reference frame that is inferred causally and on-line using monocular video along with inertial sensors. The system we implement returns a sparse point cloud for the regions of the scene that are visible but not recognized as a previously seen object, and a detailed object model and its pose in the Euclidean frame otherwise. The system includes bottom-up and top-down components, whereby deep networks trained for detection provide likelihood scores for object hypotheses provided by a nonlinear filter, whose state serves as memory. Additional networks provide likelihood scores for edges, which complements detection networks trained to be invariant to small deformations. We test our algorithm on existing datasets, and also introduce the VISMA dataset, that provides ground truth pose, point-cloud map, and object models, along with time-stamped inertial measurements.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiaohan_Fei_Visual-Inertial_Object_Detection_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiaohan Fei, Stefano Soatto
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for 3D Keypoint Estimation via View Consistency	In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised domain adaptation technique for the task of 3D keypoint prediction from a single depth scan or image. Our key idea is to utilize the fact that predictions from different views of the same or similar objects should be consistent with each other. Such view consistency can provide effective regularization for keypoint prediction on unlabeled instances. In addition, we introduce a geometric alignment term to regularize predictions in the target domain. The resulting loss function can be effectively optimized via alternating minimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on real datasets and present experimental results showing that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art general-purpose domain adaptation techniques.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xingyi_Zhou_Unsupervised_Domain_Adaptation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xingyi Zhou, Arjun Karpur, Chuang Gan, Linjie Luo, Qixing Huang
AutoLoc: Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization in Untrimmed Videos	Temporal Action Localization (TAL) in untrimmed video is important for many applications. But it is very expensive to annotate the segment-level ground truth (action class and temporal boundary). This raises the interest of addressing TAL with weak supervision, namely only video-level annotations are available during training). However, the state-of-the-art weakly-supervised TAL methods only focus on generating good Class Activation Sequence (CAS) over time but conduct simple thresholding on CAS to localize actions. In this paper, we first develop a novel weakly-supervised TAL framework called AutoLoc to directly predict the temporal boundary of each action instance. We propose a novel Outer-Inner-Contrastive (OIC) loss to automatically discover the needed segment-level supervision for training such a boundary predictor. Our method achieves dramatically improved performance: under the IoU threshold 0.5, our method improves mAP on THUMOS'14 from 13.7% to 21.2% and mAP on ActivityNet from 7.4% to 27.3%. It is also very encouraging to see that our weakly-supervised method achieves comparable results with some fully-supervised methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zheng_Shou_AutoLoc_Weakly-supervised_Temporal_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zheng Shou, Hang Gao, Lei Zhang, Kazuyuki Miyazawa, Shih-Fu Chang
Stereo Vision-based Semantic 3D Object and Ego-motion Tracking for Autonomous Driving	We propose a stereo vision-based approach for tracking the camera ego-motion and 3D semantic objects in dynamic autonomous driving scenarios. Instead of directly regressing the 3D bounding box using end-to-end approaches, we propose to use the easy-to-labeled 2D detection and discrete viewpoint classification together with a light-weight semantic inference method to obtain rough 3D object measurements. Based on the object-aware-aided camera pose tracking which is robust in dynamic environments, in combination with our novel dynamic object bundle adjustment (BA) approach to fuse temporal sparse feature correspondences and the semantic 3D measurement model, we obtain 3D object pose, velocity and anchored dynamic point cloud estimation with instance accuracy and temporal consistency. The performance of our proposed method is demonstrated in diverse scenarios. Both the ego-motion estimation and object localization are compared with the state-of-of-the-art solutions.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Peiliang_LI_Stereo_Vision-based_Semantic_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Peiliang Li, Tong Qin, andShaojie Shen
Modality Distillation with Multiple Stream Networks for Action Recognition	Diverse input data modalities can provide complementary cues for several tasks, usually leading to more robust algorithms and better performance. However, while a (training) dataset could be accurately designed to include a variety of sensory inputs, it is often the case that not all modalities are available in real life (testing) scenarios, where a model has to be deployed. This raises the challenge of how to learn robust representations leveraging multimodal data in the training stage, while considering limitations at test time, such as noisy or missing modalities. This paper presents a new approach for multimodal video action recognition, developed within the unified frameworks of distillation and privileged information, named generalized distillation. Particularly, we consider the case of learning representations from depth and RGB videos, while relying on RGB data only at test time. We propose a new approach to train an hallucination network that learns to distill depth features through multiplicative connections of spatiotemporal representations, leveraging soft labels and hard labels, as well as distance between feature maps. We report state-of-the-art results on video action classification on the largest multimodal dataset available for this task, the NTU RGB+D, as well as on the UWA3DII and Northwestern-UCLA.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Nuno_Garcia_Modality_Distillation_with_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Nuno C.

Using Object Information for Spotting Text	Text spotting, also called text detection, is a challenging computer vision task because of cluttered backgrounds, diverse imaging environments, various text sizes and similarity between some objects and characters, e.g., tyre and 'o'. However, text spotting is a vital step in numerous AI and computer vision systems, such as autonomous robots and systems for visually impaired. Due to its potential applications and commercial values, researchers have proposed various deep architectures and methods for text spotting. These methods and architectures concentrate only on text in images, but neglect other information related to text. There exists a strong relationship between certain objects and the presence of text, such as signboards or the absence of text, such as trees. In this paper, a text spotting algorithm based on text and object dependency is proposed. The proposed algorithm consists of two sub-convolutional neural networks and three training stages. For this study, a new NTU-UTOI dataset containing over 22k non-synthetic images with 277k bounding boxes for text and 42 text-related object classes is established. According to our best knowledge, it is the second largest non-synthetic text image database. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets with clutter backgrounds, COCO-Text, MSRA-TD500 and SVT show that the proposed algorithm provides comparable performance to state-of-the-art text spotting methods. Experiments are also performed on our newly established dataset to investigate the effectiveness of object information for text spotting. The experimental results indicate that the object information contributes significantly on the performance gain.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Shitala_Prasad_Using_Object_Information_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Shitala Prasad, Adams Wai Kin Kong
Self-Calibrating Isometric Non-Rigid Structure-from-Motion	We present self-calibrating isometric non-rigid structure- from-motion (SCIso-NRSfM), the first method to reconstruct a non-rigid object from at least three monocular images with constant but unknown focal length. The majority of NRSfM methods using the perspective cam- era simply assume that the calibration is known. SCIso-NRSfM leverages the recent powerful differential approaches to NRSfM, based on formu- lating local polynomial constraints, where local means correspondence- wise. In NRSfM, the local shape may be solved from these constraints. In SCIso-NRSfM, the difficulty is to also solve for the focal length as a global variable. We propose to eliminate the shape using resultants, obtaining univariate polynomials for the focal length only, whose sum of squares can then be globally minimized. SCIso-NRSfM thus solves for the focal length by integrating the constraints for all correspondences and the whole image set. Once this is done, the local shape is easily re- covered. Our experiments show that its performance is very close to the state-of-the-art methods that use a calibrated camera.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/shaifali_parashar_Self-Calibrating_Isometric__ECCV_2018_paper.php	Shaifali Parashar, Adrien Bartoli, Daniel Pizarro
MultiPoseNet: Fast Multi-Person Pose Estimation using Pose Residual Network	In this paper, we present MultiPoseNet, a novel bottom-up multi-person pose estimation architecture that combines a multi-task model with a novel assignment method. MultiPoseNet can jointly handle person detection, person segmentation and pose estimation problems. The novel assignment method is implemented by the Pose Residual Network (PRN) which receives keypoint and person detections, and produces accurate poses by assigning keypoints to person instances. On the COCO keypoints dataset, our pose estimation method outperforms all previous bottom-up methods both in accuracy (+4-point mAP over previous best result) and speed; it also performs on par with the best top-down methods while being at least 4x faster. Our method is the fastest real time system with ~23 frames/sec.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Muhammed_Kocabas_MultiPoseNet_Fast_Multi-Person_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Muhammed Kocabas, Salih Karagoz, Emre Akbas
Progressive Structure from Motion	Structure from Motion or the sparse 3D reconstruction out of individual photos is a long studied topic in computer vision. Yet none of the existing reconstruction pipelines fully addresses a progressive scenario where images are only getting available during the reconstruction process and intermediate results are delivered to the user. Incremental pipelines are capable of growing a 3D model but often get stuck in local minima due to wrong (binding) decisions taken based on incomplete information. Global pipelines on the other hand need the access to the complete viewgraph and are not capable of delivering intermediate results. In this paper we propose a new reconstruction pipeline working in a progressive manner rather than in a batch processing scheme. The pipeline is able to recover from failed reconstructions in early stages, avoids to take binding decisions, delivers a progressive output and yet maintains the capabilities of existing pipelines. We demonstrate and evaluate our method on diverse challenging public and dedicated datasets including those with highly symmetric structures and compare to the state of the art.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Alex_Locher_Progressive_Structure_from_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Alex Locher, Michal Havlena, Luc Van Gool
Affinity Derivation and Graph Merge for Instance Segmentation	We present an instance segmentation scheme based on pixel affinity information, which is the relationship of two pixels belonging to a same instance. In our scheme, we use two neural networks with similar structure. One is to predict pixel level semantic score and the other is designed to derive pixel affinities. Regarding pixels as the vertexes and affinities as edges, we then propose a simple yet effective graph merge algorithm to cluster pixels into instances. Experimental results show that our scheme can generate fine grained instance mask. With Cityscapes training data, the proposed scheme achieves 27.3 AP on test set.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yiding_Liu_Affinity_Derivation_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yiding Liu, Siyu Yang, Bin Li, Wengang Zhou, Jizheng Xu, Houqiang Li, Yan Lu
Composition Loss for Counting, Density Map Estimation and Localization in Dense Crowds	With multiple crowd gatherings of millions of people every year in events ranging from pilgrimages to protests, concerts to marathons, and festivals to funerals; visual crowd analysis is emerging as a new frontier in computer vision. In particular, counting in highly dense crowds is a challenging problem with far-reaching applicability in crowd safety and management, as well as gauging political significance of protests and demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that simultaneously solves the problems of counting, density map estimation and localization of people in a given dense crowd image. Our formulation is based on an important observation that the three problems are inherently related to each other making the loss function for optimizing a deep CNN decomposable. Since localization requires high-quality images and annotations, we introduce UCF-QNRF dataset that overcomes the shortcomings of previous datasets, and contains 1.25 million humans manually marked with dot annotations. Finally, we present evaluation measures and comparison with recent deep CNN networks, including those developed specifically for crowd counting. Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art on the new dataset, which is the most challenging dataset with the largest number of crowd annotations in the most diverse set of scenes.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Haroon_Idrees_Composition_Loss_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Haroon Idrees, Muhmmad Tayyab, Kishan Athrey, Dong Zhang, Somaya Al-Maadeed, Nasir Rajpoot, Mubarak Shah
Video Compression through Image Interpolation	An ever increasing amount of our digital communication, media consumption, and content creation revolves around videos. We share, watch, and archive many aspects of our lives through them, all of which are powered by strong video compression. Traditional video compression is laboriously hand designed and hand optimized. This paper presents an alternative in an end-to-end deep learning codec. Our codec builds one simple idea: Video compression is repeated image interpolation. It thus benefits from recent advances in deep image interpolation and generation. Our deep video codec outperforms today's prevailing codecs, such as H.261, MPEG4 Part 2, and performs on par with H.264.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chao-Yuan_Wu_Video_Compression_through_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chao-Yuan Wu, Nayan Singhal, Philipp Krahenbuhl
A Dataset and Architecture for Visual Reasoning with a Working Memory	A vexing problem in artificial intelligence is reasoning about events that occur in complex, changing visual stimuli such as in video analysis or game play. Inspired by a rich tradition of visual reasoning and memory in cognitive psychology and neuroscience, we developed an artificial, configurable visual question and answer dataset (COG) to parallel experiments in humans and animals. COG is much simpler than the general problem of video analysis, yet it addresses many of the problems relating to visual and logical reasoning and memory -- problems that remain challenging for modern deep learning architectures. We additionally propose a deep learning architecture that performs competitively on other diagnostic VQA datasets (i.e. CLEVR) as well as easy settings of the COG dataset. However, several settings of COG result in datasets that are progressively more challenging to learn. After training, the network can zero-shot generalize to many new tasks. Preliminary analyses of the network architectures trained on COG demonstrate that the network accomplishes the task in a manner interpretable to humans.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Guangyu_Robert_Yang_A_dataset_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Guangyu Robert Yang, Igor Ganichev, Xiao-Jing Wang, Jonathon Shlens, David Sussillo
Convolutional Networks with Adaptive Inference Graphs	Do convolutional networks really need a fixed feed-forward structure? What if, after identifying the high-level concept of an image, a network could move directly to a layer that can distinguish fine-grained differences? Currently, a network would first need to execute sometimes hundreds of intermediate layers that specialize in unrelated aspects. Ideally, the more a network already knows about an image, the better it should be at deciding which layer to compute next. In this work, we propose convolutional networks with adaptive inference graphs (ConvNet-AIG) that adaptively define their network topology conditioned on the input image. Following a high-level structure similar to residual networks (ResNets), ConvNet-AIG decides for each input image on the fly which layers are needed. In experiments on ImageNet we show that ConvNet-AIG learns distinct inference graphs for different categories. Both ConvNet-AIG with 50 and 101 layers outperform their ResNet counterpart, while using 20% and 33% less computations respectively. By grouping parameters into layers for related classes and only executing relevant layers, ConvNet-AIG improves both efficiency and overall classification quality. Lastly, we also study the effect of adaptive inference graphs on the susceptibility towards adversarial examples. We observe that ConvNet-AIG shows a higher robustness than ResNets, complementing other known defense mechanisms.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Andreas_Veit_Convolutional_Networks_with_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Andreas Veit, Serge Belongie
Integral Human Pose Regression	State-of-the-art human pose estimation methods are based on heat map representation. In spite of the good performance, the representation has a few issues in nature, such as non-differentiable post-processing and quantization error. This work shows that a simple integral operation relates and unifies the heat map representation and joint regression, thus avoiding the above issues. It is differentiable, efficient, and compatible with any heat map based methods. Its effectiveness is convincingly validated via comprehensive ablation experiments under various settings, specifically on 3D pose estimation, for the first time.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiao_Sun_Integral_Human_Pose_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiao Sun, Bin Xiao, Fangyin Wei, Shuang Liang, Yichen Wei
Deep Autoencoder for Combined Human Pose Estimation and Body Model Upscaling	We present a method for simultaneously estimating 3D human pose and body shape from a sparse set of wide-baseline camera views. We train a symmetric convolutional autoencoder with a dual loss that enforces learning of a latent representation that encodes skeletal joint positions, and at the same time learns a deep representation for volumetric body shape. We harness the latter to up-scale input volumetric data by a factor of 4x, whilst recovering a 3D estimate of joint positions with equal or greater accuracy than the state of the art. Inference runs in real-time (25 fps) and has potential for passive human behavior monitoring where there is a requirement for high fidelity estimation of human body shape and pose.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Matthew_Trumble_Deep_Autoencoder_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Matthew Trumble, Andrew Gilbert, Adrian Hilton, John Collomosse
Improved Structure from Motion Using Fiducial Marker Matching	In this paper, we present an incremental structure from motion (SfM) algorithm that significantly outperforms existing algorithms when fiducial markers are present in the scene, and that matches the performance of existing algorithms when no markers are present. Our algorithm uses markers to limit potential incorrect image matches, change the order in which images are added to the reconstruction, and enforce new bundle adjustment constraints. To validate our algorithm, we introduce a new dataset with 16 image collections of large indoor scenes with challenging characteristics (e.g., blank hallways, glass facades, brick walls) and with markers placed throughout. We show that our algorithm produces complete, accurate reconstructions on all 16 image collections, most of which cause other algorithms to fail. Further, by selectively masking fiducial markers, we show that the presence of even a small number of markers can improve the results of our algorithm.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Joseph_DeGol_Improved_Structure_from_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Joseph DeGol, Timothy Bretl, Derek Hoiem
Joint optimization for compressive video sensing and reconstruction under hardware constraints	Compressive video sensing is the process of encoding multiple sub-frames into a single frame with controlled sensor exposures and reconstructing the sub-frames from the single compressed frame. It is known that spatially and temporally random exposures provide the most balanced compression in terms of signal recovery. However, sensors that achieve a fully random exposure on each pixel cannot be easily realized in practice because the circuit of the sensor becomes complicated and incompatible with the sensitivity and resolution.Therefore, it is necessary to design an exposure pattern by considering the constraints enforced by hardware. In this paper, we propose a method of jointly optimizing the exposure patterns of compressive sensing and the reconstruction framework under hardware constraints. By conducting a simulation and actual experiments, we demonstrated that the proposed framework can reconstruct multiple sub-frame images with higher quality.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Michitaka_Yoshida_Joint_optimization_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Michitaka Yoshida, Akihiko Torii, Masatoshi Okutomi, Kenta Endo, Yukinobu Sugiyama, Rin-ichiro Taniguchi, Hajime Nagahara
Fully-Convolutional Point Networks for Large-Scale Point Clouds	This work proposes a general-purpose, fully-convolutional network architecture for efficiently processing large-scale 3D data. One striking characteristic of our approach is its ability to process unorganized 3D representations such as point clouds as input, then transforming them internally to ordered structures to be processed via 3D convolutions. In contrast to conventional approaches that maintain either unorganized or organized representations, from input to output, our approach has the advantage of operating on memory efficient input data representations while at the same time exploiting the natural structure of convolutional operations to avoid the redundant computing and storing of spatial information in the network. The network eliminates the need to pre- or post process the raw sensor data. This, together with the fully-convolutional nature of the network, makes it an end-to-end method able to process point clouds of huge spaces or even entire rooms with up to 200k points at once. Another advantage is that our network can produce either an ordered output or map predictions directly onto the input cloud, thus making it suitable as a general-purpose point cloud descriptor applicable to many 3D tasks. We demonstrate our network's ability to effectively learn both low-level features as well as complex compositional relationships by evaluating it on benchmark datasets for semantic voxel segmentation, semantic part segmentation and 3D scene captioning.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Dario_Rethage_Fully-Convolutional_Point_Networks_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Dario Rethage, Johanna Wald, Jurgen Sturm, Nassir Navab, Federico Tombari
Actor-centric Relation Network	Current state-of-the-art approaches for spatio-temporal action localization rely on detections at the frame level and model temporal context with 3D ConvNets. Here, we go one step further and model spatio-temporal relations to capture the interactions between human actors, relevant objects and scene elements essential to differentiate similar human actions. Our approach is weakly supervised and mines the relevant elements automatically with an actor-centric relational network (ACRN). ACRN computes and accumulates pair-wise relation information from actor and global scene features, and generates relation features for action classification. It is implemented as neural networks and can be trained jointly with an existing action detection system. We show that ACRN outperforms alternative approaches which capture relation information, and that the proposed framework improves upon the state-of-the-art performance on JHMDB and AVA. A visualization of the learned relation features confirms that our approach is able to attend to the relevant relations for each action.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chen_Sun_Actor-centric_Relation_Network_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chen Sun, Abhinav Shrivastava, Carl Vondrick, Kevin Murphy, Rahul Sukthankar, Cordelia Schmid
The Contextual Loss for Image Transformation with Non-Aligned Data	Feed-forward CNNs trained for image transformation problems rely on loss functions that measure the similarity between the generated image and a target image. Most of the common loss functions assume that these images are spatially aligned and compare pixels at corresponding locations. However, for many tasks, aligned training pairs of images will not be available. We present an alternative loss function that does not require alignment, thus providing an effective and simple solution for a new space of problems. Our loss is based on both context and semantics -- it compares regions with similar semantic meaning, while considering the context of the entire image. Hence, for example, when transferring the style of one face to another, it will translate eyes-to-eyes and mouth-to-mouth.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Roey_Mechrez_The_Contextual_Loss_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Roey Mechrez, Itamar Talmi, Lihi Zelnik-Manor
Deep Boosting for Image Denoising	Boosting is a classic algorithm which has been successfully applied to diverse computer vision tasks. In the scenario of image denoising, however, the existing boosting algorithms are surpassed by the emerging learning-based models. In this paper, we propose a novel deep boosting framework (DBF) for denoising, which integrates several convolutional networks in a feed-forward fashion. Along with the integrated networks, however, the depth of the boosting framework is substantially increased, which brings difficulty to training. To solve this problem, we introduce the concept of dense connection that overcomes the vanishing of gradients during training. Furthermore, we propose a path-widening fusion scheme cooperated with the dilated convolution to derive a lightweight yet efficient convolutional network as the boosting unit, named Dilated Dense Fusion Network (DDFN). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our DBF outperforms existing methods on widely used benchmarks, in terms of different denoising tasks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chang_Chen_Deep_Boosting_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chang Chen, Zhiwei Xiong, Xinmei Tian, Feng Wu
Unsupervised Person Re-identification by Deep Learning Tracklet Association	Most existing person re-identification (re-id) methods rely on supervised model learning on per-camera-pair manually labelled pairwise training data. This leads to poor scalability in practical re-id deployment due to the lack of exhaustive identity (ID) labelling of image pairs (both positive and negative) for every camera pair. In this work, we address this problem by proposing an unsupervised re-id deep learning approach capable of incrementally discovering and exploiting the underlying re-id discriminative information from automatically generated person tracklet data from videos in an end-to-end deep model optimisation. We formulate a Tracklet Association Unsupervised Deep Learning (TAUDL) framework characterised by jointly learning per-camera (within-camera) tracklet association (labelling) and cross-camera tracklet correlation by maximising the discovery of most likely tracklet relationships across camera views without cross-view pairwise person identity labelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TAUDL model over the state-of-the-art unsupervised and domain adaptation re-id methods using six person re-id benchmarking datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Minxian_Li_Unsupervised_Person_Re-identification_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Minxian Li, Xiatian Zhu, Shaogang Gong
3D Recurrent Neural Networks with Context Fusion for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation	Semantic segmentation of 3D unstructured point clouds remains an open research problem. Recent works predict semantic labels of 3D points by virtue of neural networks but take limited context knowledge into consideration. In this paper, a novel end-to-end approach for unstructured point cloud semantic segmentation is proposed to exploit the inherent contextual features. First the efficient pointwise pyramid pooling module is investigated to capture local structures at various densities by taking multi-scale neighborhood into account. Then the two-dimensional hierarchical recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are utilized to explore long-range spatial dependencies. Each recurrent layer takes as input the local features derived from unrolled cells and sweeps the 3D space along two horizontal directions successively to integrate structure knowledge. On challenging indoor and outdoor 3D datasets, the proposed framework demonstrates robust performance superior to state-of-the-arts.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiaoqing_Ye_3D_Recurrent_Neural_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiaoqing Ye, Jiamao Li, Hexiao Huang, Liang Du, Xiaolin Zhang
Compound Memory Networks for Few-shot Video Classification	In this paper, we propose a new memory network structure for few-shot video classification by making the following contributions. First, we propose a compound memory network (CMN) structure under the key-value memory network paradigm, in which each key memory involves multiple constituent keys. These constituent keys work collaboratively for training, which enables the CMN to obtain an optimal video representation in a larger space. Second, we introduce a multi-saliency embedding algorithm which encodes a variable-length video sequence into a fixed-size matrix representation by discovering multiple saliencies of interest. For example, given a video of car auction, some people are interested in the car, while others are interested in the auction activities. Third, we design an abstract memory on top of the constituent keys. The abstract memory and constituent keys form a layered structure, which makes the CMN more efficient and capable of being scaled, while also retaining the representation capability of the multiple keys. We compare CMN with several state-of-the-art baselines on a new few-shot video classification dataset and show the effectiveness of our approach.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Linchao_Zhu_Compound_Memory_Networks_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Linchao Zhu, Yi Yang
Deeply Learned Compositional Models for Human Pose Estimation	Compositional models represent patterns with hierarchies of meaningful parts and subparts. Their ability to characterize high-order relationships among body parts helps resolve low-level ambiguities in human pose estimation (HPE). However, prior compositional models make unrealistic assumptions on subpart-part relationships, making them incapable to characterize complex compositional patterns. Moreover, state spaces of their higher-level parts can be exponentially large, complicating both inference and learning. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel framework, termed as Deeply Learned Compositional Model (DLCM), for HPE. It exploits deep neural networks to learn the compositionality of human bodies. This results in a network with a hierarchical compositional architecture and bottom-up/top-down inference stages. In addition, we propose a novel bone-based part representation. It not only compactly encodes orientations, scales and shapes of parts, but also avoids their potentially large state spaces. With significantly lower complexities, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Wei_Tang_Deeply_Learned_Compositional_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Wei Tang, Pei Yu, Ying Wu
Point-to-Point Regression PointNet for 3D Hand Pose Estimation	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)-based methods for 3D hand pose estimation with depth cameras usually take 2D depth images as input and directly regress holistic 3D hand pose. Different from these methods, our proposed Point-to-Point Regression PointNet directly takes the 3D point cloud as input and outputs point-wise estimations, i.e., heat-maps and unit vector fields on the point cloud, representing the closeness and direction from every point in the point cloud to the hand joint. The point-wise estimations are used to infer 3D joint locations with weighted fusion. To better capture 3D spatial information in the point cloud, we apply a stacked network architecture for PointNet with intermediate supervision, which is trained end-to-end. Experiments show that our method can achieve outstanding results when compared with state-of-the-art methods on three challenging hand pose datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Liuhao_Ge_Point-to-Point_Regression_PointNet_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Liuhao Ge, Zhou Ren, Junsong Yuan
SkipNet: Learning Dynamic Routing in Convolutional Networks	While deeper convolutional networks are needed to achieve maximum accuracy in visual perception tasks, for many inputs shallower networks are sufficient. We exploit this observation by learning to skip convolutional layers on a per-input basis. We introduce SkipNet, a modified residual network, that uses a gating network to selectively skip convolutional blocks based on the activations of the previous layer. We formulate the dynamic skipping problem in the context of sequential decision making and propose a hybrid learning algorithm that combines supervised learning and reinforcement learning to address the challenges of non-differentiable skipping decisions. We show SkipNet reduces computation by 30-90% while preserving the accuracy of the original model on four benchmark datasets and outperforms the state-of-the-art dynamic networks and static compression methods. We also qualitatively evaluate the gating policy to reveal a relationship between image scale and saliency and the number of layers skipped.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xin_Wang_SkipNet_Learning_Dynamic_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xin Wang, Fisher Yu, Zi-Yi Dou, Trevor Darrell, Joseph E.

Weakly-supervised 3D Hand Pose Estimation from Monocular RGB Images	Compared with depth-based 3D hand pose estimation, it is more challenging to infer 3D hand pose from monocular RGB images, due to substantial depth ambiguity and the difficulty of obtaining fully-annotated training data. Different from existing learning-based monocular RGB-input approaches that require accurate 3D annotations for training, we propose to leverage the depth images that can be easily obtained from commodity RGB-D cameras during training, while during testing we take only RGB inputs for 3D joint predictions. In this way, we alleviate the burden of the costly 3D annotations in real-world dataset. Particularly, we propose a weakly-supervised method, adaptating from fully-annotated synthetic dataset to weakly-labeled real-world dataset with the aid of a depth regularizer, which generates depth maps from predicted 3D pose and serves as weak supervision for 3D pose regression. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed depth regularizer in both weakly-supervised and fully-supervised settings.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yujun_Cai_Weakly-supervised_3D_Hand_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yujun Cai, Liuhao Ge, Jianfei Cai, Junsong Yuan
Image Generation from Sketch Constraint Using Contextual GAN	In this paper we investigate image generation guided by hand sketch. When the input sketch is badly drawn, the output of common image-to-image translation follows the input edges due to the hard condition imposed by the translation process. Instead, we propose to use sketch as weak constraint, where the output edges do not necessarily follow the input edges. We address this problem using a novel joint image completion approach, where the sketch provides the image context for completing, or generating the output image. We train a generated adversarial network, i.e., contextual GAN to learn the joint distribution of sketch and the corresponding image by using joint images. Our contextual GAN has several advantages. First, the simple joint image representation allows for simple and effective learning of joint distribution in the same image-sketch space, which avoids complicated issues in cross-domain learning. Second, while the output is related to its input overall, the generated features exhibit more freedom in appearance and do not strictly align with the input features as previous conditional GANs do. Third, from the joint image's point of view, image and sketch are of no difference, thus exactly the same deep joint image completion network can be used for image-to-sketch generation. Experiments evaluated on three different datasets show that our contextual GAN can generate more realistic images than state-of-the-art conditional GANs on challenging inputs and generalize well on common categories.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yongyi_Lu_Image_Generation_from_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yongyi Lu, Shangzhe Wu, Yu-Wing Tai, Chi-Keung Tang
X-ray Computed Tomography Through Scatter	In current Xray CT scanners, tomographic reconstruction relies only on directly transmitted photons. The models used for reconstruction have regarded photons scattered by the body as noise or disturbance to be disposed of, either by acquisition hardware (an anti-scatter grid) or by the reconstruction software. This increases the radiation dose delivered to the patient. Treating these scattered photons as a source of information, we solve an inverse problem based on a 3D radiative transfer model that includes both elastic (Rayleigh) and inelastic (Compton) scattering. We further present ways to make the solution numerically efficient. The resulting tomographic reconstruction is more accurate than traditional CT, while enabling significant dose reduction and chemical decomposition. Demonstrations include both simulations based on a standard medical phantom and a real scattering tomography experiment.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Adam_Geva_X-ray_Computational_Tomography_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Adam Geva, Yoav Y.

PSANet: Point-wise Spatial Attention Network for Scene Parsing	We notice information flow in convolutional neural networks is restricted inside local neighborhood regions due to the physical design of convolutional filters, which limits the overall understanding of complex scenes. In this paper, we propose the point-wise spatial attention network (PSANet) to relax the local neighborhood constraint. Each position on the feature map is connected to all the other ones through a self-adaptively learned attention mask. Moreover, information propagation in bi-direction for scene parsing is enabled. Information at other positions can be collected to help the prediction of the current position and vice versa, information at the current position can be distributed to assist the prediction of other ones. Our proposed approach achieves top performance on various competitive scene parsing datasets, including ADE20K, PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes, demonstrating its effectiveness and generality.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hengshuang_Zhao_PSANet_Point-wise_Spatial_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hengshuang Zhao, Yi Zhang, Shu Liu, Jianping Shi, Chen Change Loy, Dahua Lin, Jiaya Jia
Piggyback: Adapting a Single Network to Multiple Tasks by Learning to Mask Weights	This work presents a method for adapting a single, fixed deep neural network to multiple tasks without affecting performance on already learned tasks. By building upon ideas from network quantization and pruning, we learn binary masks that ``piggyback'' on an existing network, or are applied to unmodified weights of that network to provide good performance on a new task. These masks are learned in an end-to-end differentiable fashion, and incur a low overhead of 1 bit per network parameter, per task. Even though the underlying network is fixed, the ability to mask individual weights allows for the learning of a large number of filters. We show performance comparable to dedicated fine-tuned networks for a variety of classification tasks, including those with large domain shifts from the initial task (ImageNet), and a variety of network architectures. Unlike prior work, we do not suffer from catastrophic forgetting or competition between tasks, and our performance is agnostic to task ordering.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Arun_Mallya_Piggyback_Adapting_a_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Arun Mallya, Dillon Davis, Svetlana Lazebnik
How Local is the Local Diversity? Reinforcing Sequential Determinantal Point Processes with Dynamic Ground Sets for Supervised Video Summarization	The large volume of video content and high viewing frequency demand automatic video summarization algorithms, where a key property is the capability of modeling diversity. If videos are lengthy like hours-long egocentric videos, it is necessary to track the temporal structures of the videos and enforce local diversity. The local diversity refers to that the shots selected from a short time duration are diverse but visually similar shots are allowed to co-exist in the summary if they appear far apart in the video. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic model, built upon SeqDPP, to dynamically control the time span of a video segment upon which the local diversity is imposed. In particular, we enable SeqDPP to learn to automatically infer how local the local diversity is supposed to be from the input video. The resulting model is extremely involved to train by the hallmark maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). To tackle this problem, we instead devise a reinforcement learning algorithm for training the proposed model. Extensive experiments verify the advantages of our model and the new learning algorithm over SeqDPP and MLE, respectively.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yandong_Li_How_Local_is_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yandong Li, Liqiang Wang, Tianbao Yang, Boqing Gong
Real-to-Virtual Domain Unification for End-to-End Autonomous Driving	"In the spectrum of vision-based autonomous driving, vanilla end-to-end models are not interpretable and suboptimal in performance, while mediated perception models require additional intermediate representations such as segmentation masks or detection bounding boxes, whose annotation can be prohibitively expensive as we move to a larger scale. More critically, all prior works fail to deal with the notorious domain shift if we were to merge data collected from different sources, which greatly hinders the model generalization ability. In this work, we address the above limitations by taking advantage of virtual data collected from driving simulators, and present DU-drive, an unsupervised real-to-virtual domain unification framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. It first transforms real driving data to its less complex counterpart in the virtual domain, and then predicts vehicle control commands from the generated virtual image. Our framework has three unique advantages: 1) it maps driving data collected from a variety of source distributions into a unified domain, effectively eliminating domain shift; 2) the learned virtual representation is simpler than the input real image and closer in form to the ""minimum sufficient statistic"" for the prediction task, which relieves the burden of the compression phase while optimizing the information bottleneck tradeoff and leads to superior prediction performance; 3) it takes advantage of annotated virtual data which is unlimited and free to obtain. Extensive experiments on two public driving datasets and two driving simulators demonstrate the performance superiority and interpretive capability of DU-drive."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Luona_Yang_Real-to-Virtual_Domain_Uni_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Luona Yang, Xiaodan Liang, Tairui Wang, Eric Xing
On Offline Evaluation of Vision-based Driving Models	Autonomous driving models should ideally be evaluated by deploying them on a fleet of physical vehicles in the real world. Unfortunately, this approach is not practical for the vast majority of researchers. An attractive alternative is to evaluate models offline, on a pre-collected validation dataset with ground truth annotation. In this paper, we investigate the relation between various online and offline metrics for evaluation of autonomous driving models. We find that generally offline prediction no necessarily correlated with the driving quality, and two models with identical prediction error can differ dramatically in their driving performance. We show that the correlation of offline evaluation with the driving quality can be significantly improved by selecting appropriate validation dataset and suitable offline metrics.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Felipe_Codevilla_On_Offline_Evaluation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Felipe Codevilla, Antonio M.

Learning Discriminative Video Representations Using Adversarial Perturbations	Adversarial perturbations are noise-like patterns that can subtly change the data, while failing an otherwise accurate classifier. In this paper, we propose to use such perturbations for improving the robustness of video representations. To this end, given a well-trained deep model for per-frame video recognition, we first generate adversarial noise adapted to this model. Using the original data features from the full video sequence and their perturbed counterparts, as two separate bags, we develop a binary classification problem that learns a set of discriminative hyperplanes -- as a subspace -- that will separate the two bags from each other. This subspace is then used as a descriptor for the video, dubbed discriminative subspace pooling. As the perturbed features belong to data classes that are likely to be confused with the original features, the discriminative subspace will characterize parts of the feature space that are more representative of the original data, and thus may provide robust video representations. To learn such descriptors, we formulate a subspace learning objective on the Stiefel manifold and resort to Riemannian optimization methods for solving it efficiently. We provide experiments on several video datasets and demonstrate state-of-the-art results.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jue_Wang_Learning_Discriminative_Video_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jue Wang, Anoop Cherian
stagNet: An Attentive Semantic RNN for Group Activity Recognition	Group activity recognition plays a fundamental role in a variety of applications, e.g. sports video analysis and intelligent surveillance. How to model the spatio-temporal contextual information in a scene still remains a crucial yet challenging issue. We propose a novel attentive semantic recurrent neural network (RNN), namely stagNet, for understanding group activities in videos, based on the spatio-temporal attention and semantic graph. A semantic graph is explicitly modeled to describe the spatial context of the whole scene, which is further integrated with the temporal factor via structural-RNN. Benefiting from the 'factor sharing' and 'message passing' mechanisms, our model is able to extract discriminative spatio-temporal features and to capture inter-group relationships. Moreover, we adopt a spatio-temporal attention model to attend to key persons/frames for improved performance. Two widely-used datasets are employed for performance evaluation, and the extensive results demonstrate the superiority of our method.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Mengshi_Qi_stagNet_An_Attentive_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Mengshi Qi, Jie Qin, Annan Li, Yunhong Wang, Jiebo Luo, Luc Van Gool
Spatio-temporal Transformer Network for Video Restoration	State-of-the-art video restoration methods integrate optical flow estimation networks to utilize temporal information. However, these networks typically consider only a pair of consecutive frames and hence are not capable of capturing long-range temporal dependencies and fall short of establishing correspondences across several timesteps. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel Spatio-temporal Transformer Network (STTN) which handles multiple frames at once and thereby manages to mitigate the common nuisance of occlusions in optical flow estimation. Our proposed STTN comprises a module that estimates optical flow in both space and time and a resampling layer that selectively warps target frames using the estimated flow. In our experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed network and show state-of-the-art restoration results in video super-resolution and video deblurring.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tae_Hyun_Kim_Spatio-temporal_Transformer_Network_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tae Hyun Kim, Mehdi S.

CBAM: Convolutional Block Attention Module	We propose Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), a simple and effective attention module that can be integrated with any feed-forward convolutional neural networks. Given an intermediate feature map, our module sequentially infers attention maps along two separate dimensions, channel and spatial, then the attention maps are multiplied to the input feature map for adaptive feature refinement. Because CBAM is a lightweight and general module, it can be integrated into any CNN architecture seamlessly with negligible overheads. Our module is end-to-end trainable along with base CNNs. We validate our CBAM through extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, MS COCO detection, and VOC 2007 detection datasets. Our experiments show consistent improvements on classification and detection performances with various models, demonstrating the wide applicability of CBAM. The code and models will be publicly available upon the acceptance of the paper.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Sanghyun_Woo_Convolutional_Block_Attention_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Sanghyun Woo , Jongchan Park , Joon-Young Lee, In So Kweon
Making Deep Heatmaps Robust to Partial Occlusions for 3D Object Pose Estimation	We introduce a novel method for robust and accurate 3D object pose estimation from a single color image under large occlusions. Following recent approaches, we first predict the 2D projections of 3D points related to the target object and then compute the 3D pose from these correspondences using a geometric method. Unfortunately, as the results of our experiments show, predicting these 2D projections using a regular CNN or a Convolutional Pose Machine is highly sensitive to partial occlusions, even when these methods are trained with partially occluded examples. Our solution is to predict heatmaps from multiple small patches independently and to accumulate the results to obtain accurate and robust predictions. Training subsequently becomes challenging because patches with similar appearances but different positions on the object correspond to different heatmaps. However, we provide a simple yet effective solution to deal with such ambiguities. We show that our approach outperforms existing methods on two challenging datasets: The Occluded LineMOD dataset and the YCB-Video dataset, both exhibiting cluttered scenes with highly occluded objects.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Markus_Oberweger_Making_Deep_Heatmaps_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Markus Oberweger, Mahdi Rad, Vincent Lepetit
ConvNets and ImageNet Beyond Accuracy: Understanding Mistakes and Uncovering Biases	ConvNets and Imagenet have driven the recent success of deep learning for image classification. However, the marked slowdown in performance improvement combined with the lack of robustness of neural networks to adversarial examples and their tendency to exhibit undesirable biases question the reliability of these methods. This work investigates these questions from the perspective of the end-user by using human subject studies and explanations. The contribution of this study is threefold. We first experimentally demonstrate that the accuracy and robustness of ConvNets measured on Imagenet are vastly underestimated. Next, we show that explanations can mitigate the impact of misclassified adversarial examples from the perspective of the end-user. We finally introduce a novel tool for uncovering the undesirable biases learned by a model. These contributions also show that explanations are a valuable tool both for improving our understanding of ConvNets' predictions and for designing more reliable models	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Pierre_Stock_ConvNets_and_ImageNet_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Pierre Stock, Moustapha Cisse
Beyond local reasoning for stereo confidence estimation with deep learning	Confidence measures for stereo gained popularity in recent years due to their improved capability to detect outliers and the increasing number of applications exploiting these cues. In this field, convolutional neural networks achieved top-performance compared to other known techniques in the literature by processing local information to tell disparity assignments from outliers. Despite this outstanding achievements, all approaches rely on clues extracted with small receptive fields thus ignoring most of the overall image content. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to exploit nearby and farther clues available from image and disparity domains to obtain a more accurate confidence estimation. While local information is very effective for detecting high frequency patterns, it lacks insights from farther regions in the scene. On the other hand, enlarging the receptive field allows to include clues from farther regions but produces smoother uncertainty estimation, not particularly accurate when dealing with high frequency patterns. For these reasons, we propose in this paper a multi-stage cascaded network to combine the best of the two worlds. Extensive experiments on three datasets using three popular stereo algorithms prove that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art confidence estimation techniques.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Fabio_Tosi_Beyond_local_reasoning_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Fabio Tosi, Matteo Poggi, Antonio Benincasa, Stefano Mattoccia
The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Benchmark: Object Detection and Tracking	With the advantage of high mobility, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used to fuel numerous important applications in computer vision, delivering more efficiency and convenience than surveillance cameras with fixed camera angle, scale and view. However, very limited UAV datasets are proposed, and they focus only on a specific task such as visual tracking or object detection in relatively constrained scenarios. Consequently, it is of great importance to develop an unconstrained UAV benchmark to boost related researches. In this paper, we construct a new UAV benchmark focusing on complex scenarios with new level challenges. Selected from 10 hours raw videos, about 80,000 representative frames are fully annotated with bounding boxes as well as up to 14 kinds of attributes (e.g., weather condition, flying altitude, camera view, vehicle category, and occlusion) for three fundamental computer vision tasks: object detection, single object tracking, and multiple object tracking. Then, a detailed quantitative study is performed using most recent state-of-the-art algorithms for each task. Experimental results show that the current state-of-the-art methods perform relative worse on our dataset, due to the new challenges appeared in UAV based real scenes, e.g., high density, small object, and camera motion. To our knowledge, our work is the first time to explore such issues in unconstrained scenes comprehensively. The dataset and all the experimental results are available in https://sites.google.com/site/daviddo0323/.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Dawei_Du_The_Unmanned_Aerial_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Dawei Du, Yuankai Qi, Hongyang Yu, Yifan Yang, Kaiwen Duan, Guorong Li, Weigang Zhang, Qingming Huang, Qi Tian
Improving Spatiotemporal Self-Supervision by Deep Reinforcement Learning	Self-supervised learning of convolutional neural networks can harness large amounts of cheap unlabeled data to train powerful feature representations. As surrogate task, we jointly address ordering of visual data in the spatial and temporal domain. The permutations of training samples, which are at the core of self-supervision by ordering, have so far been sampled randomly from a fixed preselected set. Based on deep reinforcement learning we propose a sampling policy that adapts to the state of the network, which is being trained. Therefore, new permutations are sampled according to their expected utility for updating the convolutional feature representation. Experimental evaluation on unsupervised and transfer learning tasks demonstrates competitive performance on standard benchmarks for image and video classification and nearest neighbor retrieval.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Uta_Buchler_Improving_Spatiotemporal_Self-Supervision_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Uta Buchler, Biagio Brattoli, Bjorn Ommer
Sub-GAN: An Unsupervised Generative Model via Subspaces	The recent years have witnessed significant growth in constructing robust generative models to capture informative distributions of natural data. However, it is difficult to fully exploit the distribution of complex data, like images and videos, due to the high dimensionality of ambient space. Sequentially, how to effectively guide the training of generative models is a crucial issue. In this paper, we present a subspace-based generative adversarial network (Sub-GAN) which simultaneously disentangles multiple latent subspaces and generates diverse samples correspondingly. Since the high-dimensional natural data usually lies on a union of low-dimensional subspaces which contain semantically extensive structure, Sub-GAN incorporates a novel clusterer that can interact with the generator and discriminator via subspace information. Unlike the traditional generative models, the proposed Sub-GAN can control the diversity of the generated samples via the multiplicity of the learned subspaces. Moreover, the Sub-GAN follows an unsupervised fashion to explore not only the visual classes but the latent continuous attributes. We demonstrate that our model can discover meaningful visual attributes which is hard to be annotated via strong supervision, e.g., the writing style of digits, thus avoid the mode collapse problem. Extensive experimental results show the competitive performance of the proposed method for both generating diverse images with satisfied quality and discovering discriminative latent subspaces.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jie_Liang_Sub-GAN_An_Unsupervised_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jie Liang, Jufeng Yang, Hsin-Ying Lee, Kai Wang, Ming-Hsuan Yang
Saliency Benchmarking Made Easy: Separating Models, Maps and Metrics	"Dozens of new models on fixation prediction are published every year and compared on open benchmarks such as MIT300 and LSUN. However, progress in the field can be difficult to judge because models are compared using a variety of inconsistent metrics. Here we show that no single saliency map can perform well under all metrics. Instead, we propose a principled approach to solve the benchmarking problem by separating the notions of saliency models, maps and metrics. Inspired by Bayesian decision theory, we define a saliency model to be a probabilistic model of fixation density prediction and a saliency map to be a metric-specific prediction derived from the model density which maximizes the expected performance on that metric given the model density. We derive these optimal saliency maps for the most commonly used saliency metrics (AUC, sAUC, NSS, CC, SIM, KL-Div) and show that they can be computed analytically or approximated with high precision. We show that this leads to consistent rankings in all metrics and avoids the penalties of using one saliency map for all metrics. Our method allows researchers to have their model compete on many different metrics with state-of-the-art in those metrics: ""good"" models will perform well in all metrics."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Matthias_Kummerer_Saliency_Benchmarking_Made_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Matthias Kummerer, Thomas S.

Person Search via A Mask-guided Two-stream CNN Model	In this work, we tackle the problem of person search, which is a challenging task consisted of pedestrian detection and person re-identification~(re-ID). Instead of sharing representations in a single joint model, we find that separating detector and re-ID feature extraction yields better performance. In order to extract more representative features for each identity, we segment out the foreground person from the original image patch. We propose a simple yet effective re-ID method, which models foreground person and original image patches individually, and obtains enriched representations from two separate CNN streams. From the experiments on two standard person search benchmarks of CUHK-SYSU and PRW, we achieve mAP of $83.0%$ and $32.6%$ respectively, surpassing the state of the art by a large margin (more than 5pp).	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Di_Chen_Person_Search_via_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Di Chen, Shanshan Zhang, Wanli Ouyang, Jian Yang, Ying Tai
Pairwise Body-Part Attention for Recognizing Human-Object Interactions	In human-object interactions (HOI) recognition, conventional methods consider the human body as a whole and pay a uniform attention to the entire body region. They ignore the fact that normally, human interacts with an object by using some parts of the body. In this paper, we argue that different body parts should be paid with different attention in HOI recognition, and the correlations between different body parts should be further considered. This is because our body parts always work collaboratively. We propose a new pairwise body-part attention model which can learn to focus on crucial parts, and their correlations for HOI recognition. A novel attention based feature selection method and a feature representation scheme that can capture pairwise correlations between body parts are introduced in the model. Our proposed approach achieved 10% relative improvement in mAP over the state-of-the-art results in HOI recognition on the HICO dataset. We will make our model and source codes publicly available.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Haoshu_Fang_Pairwise_Body-Part_Attention_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hao-Shu Fang, Jinkun Cao, Yu-Wing Tai, Cewu Lu
Generative Adversarial Network with Spatial Attention for Face Attribute Editing	Face attribute editing aims at editing the face image with the given attribute. Most existing works employ Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to operate face attribute editing. However, these methods inevitably change the attribute-irrelevant regions, as shown in Fig.~ ef{fig1}. Therefore, we introduce the spatial attention mechanism into GAN framework (referred to as SaGAN), to only alter the attribute-specific region and keep the rest unchanged. Our approach SaGAN consists of a generator and a discriminator. The generator contains an attribute manipulation network (AMN) to edit the face image, and a spatial attention network (SAN) to localize the attribute-specific region which restricts the alternation of AMN within this region. The discriminator endeavors to distinguish the generated images from the real ones, and classify the face attribute. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve promising visual results, and keep those attribute-irrelevant regions unchanged. Besides, our approach can benefit the face recognition by data augmentation.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Gang_Zhang_Generative_Adversarial_Network_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Gang Zhang, Meina Kan, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen
Beyond Part Models: Person Retrieval with Refined Part Pooling (and A Strong Convolutional Baseline)	Employing part-level features offers fine-grained information for pedestrian image description. A prerequisite of part discovery is that each part should be well located. Instead of using external resources like pose estimator, we consider content consistency within each part for precise part location. Specifically, we target at learning discriminative part-informed features for person retrieval and make two contributions. (i) A network named Part-based Convolutional Baseline (PCB). Given an image input, it outputs a convolutional descriptor consisting of several part-level features. With a uniform partition strategy, PCB achieves competitive results with the state-of-the-art methods, proving itself as a strong convolutional baseline for person retrieval. (ii) A refined part pooling (RPP) method. Uniform partition inevitably incurs outliers in each part, which are in fact more similar to other parts. RPP re-assigns these outliers to the parts they are closest to, resulting in refined parts with enhanced within-part consistency. Experiment confirms that RPP allows PCB to gain another round of performance boost. For instance, on the Market-1501 dataset, we achieve (77.4+4.2)% mAP and (92.3+1.5)% rank-1 accuracy, surpassing the state of the art by a large margin.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yifan_Sun_Beyond_Part_Models_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yifan Sun, Liang Zheng, Yi Yang, Qi Tian, Shengjin Wang
Remote Photoplethysmography Correspondence Feature for 3D Mask Face Presentation Attack Detection	3D mask face presentation attack, as a new challenge in face recognition, has been attracting increasing attention. Recently, remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) is employed as an intrinsic liveness cue which is independent of the mask appearance. Although existing rPPG-based methods achieve promising results on both intra and cross dataset scenarios, they may not be robust enough when rPPG signals are contaminated by noise. In this paper, we propose a new liveness feature, called rPPG correspondence feature (CFrPPG) to precisely identify the heartbeat vestige from the observed noisy rPPG signals. To further overcome the global interferences, we propose a novel learning strategy which incorporates the global noise within the CFrPPG feature. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed feature not only outperforms the state-of-the-art rPPG based methods on 3D mask attacks but also be able to handle the practical scenarios with dim light and camera motion.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Siqi_Liu_Remote_Photoplethysmography_Correspondence_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Si-Qi Liu, Xiangyuan Lan, Pong C.

Lifting Layers: Analysis and Applications	The great advances of learning-based approaches in image processing and computer vision are largely based on deeply nested networks that compose linear transfer functions with suitable non-linearities. Interestingly, the most frequently used non-linearities in imaging applications (variants of the rectified linear unit) are uncommon in low dimensional approximation problems. In this paper we propose a novel non-linear transfer function, called lifting, which is motivated from a related technique in convex optimization. A lifting layer increases the dimensionality of the input, naturally yields a linear spline when combined with a fully connected layer, and therefore closes the gap between low and high dimensional approximation problems. Moreover, applying the lifting operation to the loss layer of the network allows us to handle non-convex and flat (zero-gradient) cost functions. We analyze the proposed lifting theoretically, exemplify interesting properties in synthetic experiments and demonstrate its effectiveness in deep learning approaches to image classification and denoising.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Michael_Moeller_Lifting_Layers_Analysis_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Peter Ochs, Tim Meinhardt, Laura Leal-Taixe, Michael Moeller
Affine Correspondences between Central Cameras for Rapid Relative Pose Estimation	This paper presents a novel algorithm to estimate the relative pose, i.e. the 3D rotation and translation of two cameras, from two affine correspondences (ACs) considering any central camera model. The solver is built on new epipolar constraints describing the relationship of an AC and any central views. We also show that the pinhole case is a specialization of the proposed approach. Benefiting from the low number of required correspondences, robust estimators like LO-RANSAC need fewer samples, and thus terminate earlier than using the five-point method. Tests on publicly available datasets containing pinhole, fisheye and catadioptric camera images confirmed that the method often leads to results superior to the state-of-the-art in terms of geometric accuracy.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ivan_Eichhardt_Affine_Correspondences_between_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ivan Eichhardt, Dmitry Chetverikov
MT-VAE: Learning Motion Transformations to Generate Multimodal Human Dynamics	Long-term human motion can be represented as a series of motion modes—motion sequences that capture short-term temporal dynamics—with transitions between them. We leverage this structure and present a novel Motion Transformation Variational Auto-Encoders (MT-VAE) for learning motion sequence generation. Our model jointly learns a feature embedding for motion modes (that the motion sequence can be reconstructed from) and a feature transformation that represents the transition of one motion mode to the next motion mode. Our model is able to generate multiple diverse and plausible motion sequences in the future from the same input. We apply our approach to both facial and full body motion, and demonstrate applications like analogy-based motion transfer and video synthesis.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xinchen_Yan_Generating_Multimodal_Human_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xinchen Yan, Akash Rastogi, Ruben Villegas, Kalyan Sunkavalli, Eli Shechtman, Sunil Hadap, Ersin Yumer, Honglak Lee
NetAdapt: Platform-Aware Neural Network Adaptation for Mobile Applications	This work proposes an algorithm, called NetAdapt, that automatically adapts a pre-trained deep neural network to a mobile platform given a resource budget. While many existing algorithms simplify networks based on the number of MACs or weights, optimizing those indirect metrics may not necessarily reduce the direct metrics, such as latency and energy consumption. To solve this problem, NetAdapt incorporates direct metrics into its adaptation algorithm. These direct metrics are evaluated using empirical measurements, so that detailed knowledge of the platform and toolchain is not required. NetAdapt automatically and progressively simplifies a pre-trained network until the resource budget is met while maximizing the accuracy. Experiment results show that NetAdapt achieves better accuracy versus latency trade-offs on both mobile CPU and mobile GPU, compared with the state-of-the-art automated network simplification algorithms. For image classification on the ImageNet dataset, NetAdapt achieves up to a 1.7x speedup in measured inference latency with equal or higher accuracy on MobileNets (V1&V2).	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tien-Ju_Yang_NetAdapt_Platform-Aware_Neural_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tien-Ju Yang, Andrew Howard, Bo Chen, Xiao Zhang, Alec Go, Mark Sandler, Vivienne Sze, Hartwig Adam
Model Adaptation with Synthetic and Real Data for Semantic Dense Foggy Scene Understanding	This work addresses the problem of semantic scene understanding under dense fog. Although considerable progress has been made in semantic scene understanding, it is mainly related to clear-weather scenes. Extending recognition methods to adverse weather conditions such as fog is crucial for outdoor applications. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named Curriculum Model Adaptation (CMAda), which gradually adapts a semantic segmentation model from light synthetic fog to dense real fog in multiple steps, using both synthetic and real foggy data. In addition, we present three other main stand-alone contributions: 1) a novel method to add synthetic fog to real, clear-weather scenes using semantic input; 2) a new fog density estimator; 3) the Foggy Zurich dataset comprising 3808 real foggy images, with pixel-level semantic annotations for 16 images with dense fog. Our experiments show that 1) our fog simulation slightly outperforms a state-of-the-art competing simulation with respect to the task of semantic foggy scene understanding (SFSU); 2) CMAda improves the performance of state-of-the-art models for SFSU significantly by leveraging unlabeled real foggy data. The datasets and code will be made publicly available.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Christos_Sakaridis_Semantic_Scene_Understanding_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Christos Sakaridis, Dengxin Dai, Simon Hecker, Luc Van Gool
Recovering Accurate 3D Human Pose in The Wild Using IMUs and a Moving Camera	In this work, we propose a method that combines a single hand-held camera and a set of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) attached at the body limbs to estimate accurate 3D poses in the wild. This poses many new challenges: the moving camera, heading drift, cluttered background, occlusions and many people visible in the video. We associate 2D pose detections in each image to the corresponding IMU-equipped persons by solving a novel graph based optimization problem that forces 3D to 2D coherency within a frame and across long range frames. Given associations, we jointly optimize the pose of a statistical body model, the camera pose and heading drift using a continuous optimization framework. We validated our method on the TotalCapture dataset, which provides video and IMU synchronized with ground truth. We obtain an accuracy of 26mm, which makes it accurate enough to serve as a benchmark for image-based 3D pose estimation in the wild. Using our method, we recorded 3D Poses in the Wild (3DPW ), a new dataset consisting of more than 51; 000 frames with accurate 3D pose in challenging sequences, including walking in the city, going up-stairs, having coffee or taking the bus. We make the reconstructed 3D poses, video, IMU and 3D models available for research purposes at http://virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de/3DPW.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Timo_von_Marcard_Recovering_Accurate_3D_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Timo von Marcard, Roberto Henschel, Michael J.

Multi-object Tracking with Neural Gating Using Bilinear LSTM	In recent deep online and near-online multi-object tracking approaches, a difficulty has been to incorporate long-term appearance models to efficiently score object tracks under severe occlusion and multiple missing detections. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent network model, the bilinear LSTM, in order to improve long-term appearance models via a recurrent network. Based on intuitions drawn from recursive least squares, bilinear LSTM stores building blocks of a linear predictor in its memory, which is then coupled with the input in a multiplicative manner, instead of the additive coupling in conventional LSTM approaches. Such coupling resembles an online learned classifier/regressor at each time step, which we have found to improve performances in using LSTM for appearance modeling. We also propose novel data augmentation approaches to efficiently train recurrent models that score object tracks on both appearance and motion. We train an LSTM that can score object tracks based on both appearance and motion and utilize it in a multiple hypothesis tracking framework. In experiments, we show that with our novel LSTM model, we achieved state-of-the-art performance on near-online multiple object tracking on the MOT 2016 and MOT 2017 benchmarks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chanho_Kim_Multi-object_Tracking_with_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chanho Kim, Fuxin Li, James M.

Learnable PINs: Cross-Modal Embeddings for Person Identity	We propose and investigate an identity sensitive joint embedding of face and voice. Such an embedding enables cross-modal retrieval from voice to face and from face to voice. We make the following four contributions: first, we show that the embedding can be learnt from videos of talking faces, without requiring any identity labels, using a form of cross-modal self-supervision; second, we develop a curriculum learning schedule for hard negative mining targeted to this task, that is essential for learning to proceed successfully; third, we demonstrate and evaluate cross-modal retrieval for identities unseen and unheard during training over a number of scenarios and establish a benchmark for this novel task; finally, we show an application of using the joint embedding for automatically retrieving and labelling characters in TV dramas.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Samuel_Albanie_Learnable_PINs_Cross-Modal_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Arsha Nagrani, Samuel Albanie, Andrew Zisserman
Learning to Separate Object Sounds by Watching Unlabeled Video	"Perceiving a scene most fully requires all the senses. Yet modeling how objects look and sound is challenging: most natural scenes and events contain multiple objects, and the audio track mixes all the sound sources together. We propose to learn audio-visual object models from unlabeled video, then exploit the visual context to perform audio source separation in novel videos. Our approach relies on a deep multi-instance multi-label learning framework to disentangle the audio frequency bases that map to individual visual objects, even without observing/hearing those objects in isolation. We show how the recovered disentangled bases can be used to guide audio source separation to obtain better-separated, object-level sounds. Our work is the first to learn audio source separation from large-scale ""in the wild"" videos containing multiple audio sources per video. We obtain state-of-the-art results on visually-aided audio source separation and audio denoising.

Deep Burst Denoising	"Noise is an inherent issue of low-light image capture, which is worsened on mobile devices due to their narrow apertures and small sensors. One strategy for mitigating noise in low-light situations is to increase the shutter time, allowing each photosite to integrate more light and decrease noise variance. However, there are two downsides of long exposures: (a) bright regions can exceed the sensor range, and (b) camera and scene motion will cause blur. Another way of gathering more light is to capture multiple short (thus noisy) frames in a ""burst"" and intelligently integrate the content, thus avoiding the above downsides. In this paper, we use the burst-capture strategy and implement the intelligent integration via a recurrent fully convolutional deep neural net (CNN). We build our novel, multi-frame architecture to be a simple addition to any single frame denoising model. The resulting architecture denoises all frames in a sequence of arbitrary length. We show that it achieves state of the art denoising results on our burst dataset, improving on the best published multi-frame techniques, such as VBM4D and FlexISP. Finally, we explore other applications of multi-frame image enhancement and show that our CNN architecture generalizes well to image super-resolution."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Clement_Godard_Deep_Burst_Denoising_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Clement Godard, Kevin Matzen, Matt Uyttendaele
Pyramid Dilated Deeper ConvLSTM for Video Salient Object Detection	This paper proposes a fast video salient object detection model, based on a novel recurrent network architecture, named Pyramid Dilated Bidirectional ConvLSTM (PDB-ConvLSTM). A Pyramid Dilated Convolution (PDC) module is first designed for simultaneously extracting spatial features at multiple scales. These spatial features are then concatenated and fed into an extended Deeper Bidirectional ConvLSTM (DB-ConvLSTM) to learn spatiotemporal information. Forward and backward ConvLSTM units are placed in two layers and connected in a cascaded way, encouraging information flow between the bi-directional streams and leading to deeper feature extraction. We further augment DB-ConvLSTM with a PDC-like structure, by adopting several dilated DB-ConvLSTMs to extract multi-scale spatiotemporal information. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms previous video saliency models in a large margin, with a real-time speed of 20 fps on a single GPU. With unsupervised video object segmentation as an example application, the proposed model (with a CRF-based post-process) achieves state-of-the-art results on two popular benchmarks, well demonstrating its superior performance and high applicability.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hongmei_Song_Pseudo_Pyramid_Deeper_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hongmei Song, Wenguan Wang, Sanyuan Zhao, Jianbing Shen, Kin-Man Lam
Orthogonal Deep Features Decomposition for Age-Invariant Face Recognition	As facial appearance is subject to significant intra-class variations caused by the aging process over time, age-invariant face recognition (AIFR) remains a major challenge in face recognition community. To reduce the intra-class discrepancy caused by aging, in this paper we propose a novel approach (namely, Orthogonal Embedding CNNs, or OE-CNNs) to learn the age-invariant deep face features. Specifically, we decompose deep face features into two orthogonal components to represent age-related and identity-related features. As a result, identity-related features that are robust to aging are then used for AIFR. Besides, for complementing the existing cross-age datasets and advancing the research in this field, we construct a brand-new large-scale Cross-Age Face dataset (CAF). Extensive experiments conducted on the three public domain face aging datasets (MORPH Album 2, CACD-VS and FG-NET have shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the value of the constructed CAF dataset on AIFR. Benchmarking our algorithm on one of the most popular general face recognition (GFR) dataset LFW additionally demonstrates the comparable generalization performance on GFR.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/yitong_wang_Orthogonal_Deep_Features_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yitong Wang, Dihong Gong, Zheng Zhou, Xing Ji, Hao Wang, Zhifeng Li, Wei Liu, Tong Zhang
A Trilateral Weighted Sparse Coding Scheme for Real-World Image Denoising	Most of existing image denoising methods assume the corrupted noise to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). However, the realistic noise in real-world noisy images is much more complex than AWGN, and is hard to be modeled by simple analytical distributions. As a result, many state-of-the-art denoising methods in literature become much less effective when applied to real noisy images captured by CCD or CMOS cameras. In this paper, we develop a trilateral weighted sparse coding (TWSC) scheme for robust real-world image denoising. Specifically, we introduce three weight matrices into the data and regularization terms of the sparse coding framework to characterize the statistics of realistic noise and image priors. TWSC can be reformulated as a linear equality-constrained problem and can be solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers. The existence and uniqueness of the solution and convergence of the proposed algorithm are analyzed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed TWSC scheme outperforms state-of-the-art denoising methods on removing realistic noise.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/XU_JUN_A_Trilateral_Weighted_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jun Xu, Lei Zhang, David Zhang
Deformable Pose Traversal Convolution for 3D Action and Gesture Recognition	The representation of 3D pose plays a critical role for 3D body action and hand gesture recognition. Rather than directly representing the 3D pose using its joint locations, in this paper, we propose Deformable Pose Traversal Convolution which applies one-dimensional convolution to traverse the 3D pose to represent it. Instead of fixing the reception field when performing traversal convolution, it optimizes the convolutional kernel for each joint, by considering contextual joints with various weights. This deformable convolution can better utilize contextual joints for action and gesture recognition and is more robust to noisy joints. Moreover, by feeding the learned pose feature to a LSTM, we can perform end-to-end training which jointly optimizes 3D pose representation and temporal sequence recognition. Experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the competitive performance of our proposed method, as well as its efficiency and robustness to handle noisy pose.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Junwu_Weng_Deformable_Pose_Traversal_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Junwu Weng, Mengyuan Liu, Xudong Jiang, Junsong Yuan
Neural Procedural Reconstruction for Residential Buildings	This paper proposes a novel 3D reconstruction approach, dubbed Neural Procedural Reconstruction (NPR), which trains deep neural networks to procedurally apply shape grammar rules and reconstruct CAD-quality models from 3D points. In contrast to Procedural Modeling (PM), which randomly applies shape grammar rules to synthesize 3D models, NPR classifies a rule branch to explore and regresses geometric parameters at each rule application. We demonstrate the proposed system for residential buildings with aerial LiDAR as the input. Our 3D models boast extremely compact geometry and semantically segmented architectural components. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on hundreds of houses show that our approach robustly generates CAD-quality 3D models from raw sensor data, making significant improvements over the existing state-of-the-art.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Huayi_Zeng_Neural_Procedural_Reconstruction_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Huayi Zeng, Jiaye Wu, Yasutaka Furukawa
Deep Volumetric Video From Very Sparse Multi-View Performance Capture	We present a deep learning-based volumetric capture approach for performance capture using a passive and highly sparse multi-view capture system. We focus on a template-free, per-frame 3D surface reconstruction from as few as three RGB sensors, where conventional visual hull or multi-view stereo methods would fail. State-of-the-art performance capture systems require either pre-scanned actors, large number of cameras or active sensors. We introduce a novel multi-view Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that maps 2D images to a 3D volumetric field that encodes the probabilistic distribution of surface points of the captured subject. By querying the resulting field, we can instantiate the clothed human body at arbitrary resolutions. Our approach also scales to different numbers of input images, which yield increased reconstruction quality when more views are used. Though only trained on synthetic data, our network can generalize to real captured performances. Since high-quality temporal surface reconstructions are possible, our method is suitable for low-cost full body volumetric capture solutions for consumers, which are gaining popularity for VR and AR content creation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is significantly more robust and accurate than existing techniques where only very sparse views are available.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zeng_Huang_Deep_Volumetric_Video_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zeng Huang, Tianye Li, Weikai Chen, Yajie Zhao, Jun Xing, Chloe LeGendre, Linjie Luo, Chongyang Ma, Hao Li
Straight to the Facts: Learning Knowledge Base Retrieval for Factual Visual Question Answering	Question answering is an important task for autonomous agents and virtual assistants alike and was shown to support the disabled in efficiently navigating an overwhelming environment. Many existing methods focus on observation-based questions, ignoring our ability to seamlessly combine observed content with general knowledge. To understand interactions with a knowledge base, a dataset has been introduced recently and keyword matching techniques were shown to yield compelling results despite being vulnerable to misconceptions due to synonyms and homographs. To address this issue, we develop a learning-based approach which goes straight to the facts via a learned embedding space. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on the challenging recently introduced fact-based visual question answering dataset, outperforming competing methods by more than 5%.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Medhini_Gulganjalli_Narasimhan_Straight_to_the_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Medhini Narasimhan, Alexander G.

Deep Video Quality Assessor: From Spatio-temporal Visual Sensitivity to A Convolutional Neural Aggregation Network	Incorporating spatio-temporal human visual perception into video quality assessment (VQA) remains a formidable issue. Previous statistical or computational models of spatio-temporal perception have limitations to be applied to the general VQA algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel full-reference (FR) VQA framework named Deep Video Quality Assessor (DeepVQA) to quantify the spatio-temporal visual perception via a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a convolutional neural aggregation network (CNAN). Our framework enables to figure out the spatio-temporal sensitivity behavior through learning in accordance with the subjective score. In addition, to manipulate the temporal variation of distortions, we propose a novel temporal pooling method using an attention model. In the experiment, we show DeepVQA remarkably achieves the state-of-the-art prediction accuracy of more than 0.9 correlation, which is ~5% higher than those of conventional methods on the LIVE and CSIQ video databases.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Woojae_Kim_Deep_Video_Quality_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Woojae Kim, Jongyoo Kim, Sewoong Ahn, Jinwoo Kim, Sanghoon Lee
SaaS: Speed as a Supervisor for Semi-supervised Learning	We introduce the SaaS Algorithm for semi-supervised learning, which uses learning speed during stochastic gradient descent in a deep neural network to measure the quality of an iterative estimate of the posterior probability of unknown labels. Training speed in supervised learning correlates strongly with the percentage of correct labels, so we use it as an inference criterion for the unknown labels, without attempting to infer the model parameters at first. Despite its simplicity, SaaS achieves state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised learning benchmarks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Safa_Cicek_SaaS_Speed_as_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Safa Cicek, Alhussein Fawzi, Stefano Soatto
End-to-End Incremental Learning	Although deep learning approaches have stood out in recent years due to their state-of-the-art results, they continue to suffer from catastrophic forgetting, a dramatic decrease in overall performance when training with new classes added incrementally. This is due to current neural network architectures requiring the entire dataset, consisting of all the samples from the old as well as the new classes, to update the model -a requirement that becomes easily unsustainable as the number of classes grows. We address this issue with our approach to learn deep neural networks incrementally, using new data and only a small exemplar set corresponding to samples from the old classes. This is based on a loss composed of a distillation measure to retain the knowledge acquired from the old classes, and a cross-entropy loss to learn the new classes. Our incremental training is achieved while keeping the entire framework end-to-end, i.e., learning the data representation and the classifier jointly, unlike recent methods with no such guarantees. We evaluate our method extensively on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet (ILSVRC 2012) image classification datasets, and show state-of-the-art performance.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Francisco_M._Castro_End-to-End_Incremental_Learning_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Francisco M.

Objects that Sound	In this paper our objectives are, first, networks that can embed audio and visual inputs into a common space that is suitable for cross-modal retrieval; and second, a network that can localize the object that sounds in an image, given the audio signal. We achieve both these objectives by training from unlabelled video using only audio-visual correspondence (AVC) as the objective function. This is a form of cross-modal self-supervision from video. To this end, we design new network architectures that can be trained for cross-modal retrieval and localizing the sound source in an image, by using the AVC task. We make the following contributions: (i) show that audio and visual embeddings can be learnt that enable both within-mode (e.g. audio-to-audio) and between-mode retrieval; (ii) explore various architectures for the AVC task, including those for the visual stream that ingest a single image, or multiple images, or a single image and multi-frame optical flow; (iii) show that the semantic object that sounds within an image can be localized (using only the sound, no motion or flow information); and (iv) give a cautionary tale on how to avoid undesirable shortcuts in the data preparation.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Relja_Arandjelovic_Objects_that_Sound_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Relja Arandjelovic, Andrew Zisserman
DFT-based Transformation Invariant Pooling Layer for Visual Classification	We propose a novel discrete Fourier transform-based pooling layer for convolutional neural networks. The DFT magnitude pooling replaces the traditional max/average pooling layer between the convolution and fully-connected layers to retain translation invariance and shape preserving (aware of shape difference) properties based on the shift theorem of the Fourier transform. Thanks to the ability to handle image misalignment while keeping important structural information in the pooling stage, the DFT magnitude pooling improves the classification accuracy significantly. In addition, we propose the DFT+ method for ensemble networks using the middle convolution layer outputs. The proposed methods are extensively evaluated on various classification tasks using the ImageNet, CUB 2010-2011, MIT Indoors, Caltech 101, FMD and DTD datasets. The AlexNet, VGG-VD 16, Inception-v3, and ResNet are used as the base networks, upon which DFT and DFT+ methods are implemented. Experimental results show that the proposed methods improve the classification performance in all networks and datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jongbin_Ryu_DFT-based_Transformation_Invariant_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jongbin Ryu, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Jongwoo Lim
Learning Deep Representations with Probabilistic Knowledge Transfer	Knowledge Transfer (KT) techniques tackle the problem of transferring the knowledge from a large and complex neural network into a smaller and faster one. However, existing KT methods are tailored towards classification tasks and they cannot be used efficiently for other representation learning tasks. In this paper we propose a novel probabilistic knowledge transfer method that works by matching the probability distribution of the data in the feature space instead of their actual representation. Apart from outperforming existing KT techniques, the proposed method allows for overcoming several of their limitations providing new insight into KT as well as novel KT applications, ranging from KT from handcrafted feature extractors to cross-modal KT from the textual modality into the representation extracted from the visual modality of the data.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Nikolaos_Passalis_Learning_Deep_Representations_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Nikolaos Passalis, Anastasios Tefas
Towards Realistic Predictors	A new class of predictors, denoted realistic predictors, is defined. These are predictors that, like humans, assess the difficulty of examples, reject to work on those that are deemed too hard, but guarantee good performance on the ones they operate on. In this paper, we talk about a particular case of it, realistic classifiers. The central problem in realistic classification, the design of an inductive predictor of hardness scores, is considered. It is argued that this should be a predictor independent of the classifier itself, but tuned to it, and learned without explicit supervision, so as to learn from its mistakes. A new architecture is proposed to accomplish these goals by complementing the classifier with an auxiliary hardness prediction network (HP-Net). Sharing the same inputs as classifiers, the HP-Net outputs the hardness scores to be fed to the classifier as loss weights. Alternatively, the output of classifiers is also fed to HP-Net in a new defined loss, variant of cross entropy loss. The two networks are trained jointly in an adversarial way where, as the classifier learns to improve its predictions, the HP-Net refines its hardness scores. Given the learned hardness predictor, a simple implementation of realistic classifiers is proposed by rejecting examples with large scores. Experimental results not only provide evidence in support of the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and the learned hardness predictor, but also show that the realistic classifier always improves performance on the examples that it accepts to classify, performing better on these examples than an equivalent nonrealistic classifier. All of these make it possible for realistic classifiers to guarantee a good performance.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Pei_Wang_Towards_Realistic_Predictors_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Pei Wang, Nuno Vasconcelos
Eliminating the Blind Spot: Adapting 3D Object Detection and Monocular Depth Estimation to 360° Panoramic Imagery	Recent automotive vision work has focused almost exclusively on processing forward-facing cameras. However, future autonomous vehicles will not be viable without a more comprehensive surround sensing, akin to a human driver, as can be provided by 360° panoramic cameras. We present an approach to adapt contemporary deep network architectures developed on conventional rectilinear imagery to work on equirectangular 360° panoramic imagery. To address the lack of annotated panoramic automotive datasets availability, we adapt contemporary automotive dataset, via style and projection transformations, to facilitate the cross-domain retraining of contemporary algorithms for panoramic imagery. Following this approach we retrain and adapt existing architectures to recover scene depth and 3D pose of vehicles from monocular panoramic imagery without any panoramic training labels or calibration parameters. Our approach is evaluated qualitatively on crowd-sourced panoramic images and quantitatively using an automotive environment simulator to provide the first benchmark for such techniques within panoramic imagery.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Gregoire_Payen_de_La_Garanderie_Eliminating_the_Dreaded_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Greire Payen de La Garanderie, Amir Atapour Abarghouei, Toby P.

Revisiting the Inverted Indices for Billion-Scale Approximate Nearest Neighbors	This work addresses the problem of billion-scale nearest neighbor search. The state-of-the-art retrieval systems for billion-scale databases are currently based on the inverted multi-index, the recently proposed generalization of the inverted index structure. The multi-index provides a very fine-grained partition of the feature space that allows extracting concise and accurate short-lists of candidates for the search queries. In this paper, we argue that the potential of the simple inverted index was not fully exploited in previous works and advocate its usage both for the highly-entangled deep descriptors and relatively disentangled SIFT descriptors. We introduce a new retrieval system that is based on the inverted index and outperforms the multi-index by a large margin for the same memory consumption and construction complexity. For example, our system achieves the state-of-the-art recall rates several times faster on the dataset of one billion deep descriptors compared to the efficient implementation of the inverted multi-index from the FAISS library.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Dmitry_Baranchuk_Revisiting_the_Inverted_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Dmitry Baranchuk, Artem Babenko, Yury Malkov
Shuffle-Then-Assemble: Learning Object-Agnostic Visual Relationship Features	Due to fact that it is prohibitively expensive to completely annotate visual relationships, ie, the (obj1, rel, obj2) triplets, relationship models are inevitably biased to object classes of limited pairwise patterns, leading to poor generalization to rare or unseen object combinations. Therefore, we are interested in learning object-agnostic visual features for more generalizable relationship models. By ``agnostic'', we mean that the feature is less likely biased to the classes of paired objects. To alleviate the bias, we propose a novel Shuffle-Then-Assemble pre-training strategy. First, we discard all the triplet relationship annotations in an image, leaving two unpaired object domains without obj1-obj2 alignment. Then, our feature learning is to recover possible obj1-obj2 pairs. In particular, we design a cycle of residual transformations between the two domains, where the identity mappings encourage the RoI features to capture shared but not object-specific visual patterns. Extensive experiments on two visual relationship benchmarks show that by using our pre-trained features, naive relationship models can be consistently improved and even outperform other state-of-the-art relationship models.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/XU_YANG_Shuffle-Then-Assemble_Learning_Object-Agnostic_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xu Yang, Hanwang Zhang, Jianfei Cai
3D Vehicle Trajectory Reconstruction in Monocular Video Data Using Environment Structure Constraints	We present a framework to reconstruct three-dimensional vehicle trajectories using monocular video data. We track two-dimensional vehicle shapes on pixel level exploiting instance-aware semantic segmentation techniques and optical flow cues. We apply Structure from Motion techniques to vehicle and background images to determine for each frame camera poses relative to vehicle instances and background structures. By combining vehicle and background camera pose information, we restrict the vehicle trajectory to a one-parameter family of possible solutions. We compute a ground representation by fusing background structures and corresponding semantic segmentations. We propose a novel method to determine vehicle trajectories consistent to image observations and reconstructed environment structures as well as a criterion to identify frames suitable for scale ratio estimation. We show qualitative results using drone imagery as well as driving sequences from the Cityscape dataset. Due to the lack of suitable benchmark datasets we present a new dataset to evaluate the quality of reconstructed three-dimensional vehicle trajectories. The video sequences show vehicles in urban areas and are rendered using the path-tracing render engine Cycles. In contrast to previous work, we perform a quantitative evaluation of the presented approach. Our algorithm achieves an average reconstruction-to-ground-truth-trajectory distance of 0.31 meter using this dataset. The dataset including evaluation scripts will be publicly available on our website.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Sebastian_Bullinger_3D_Vehicle_Trajectory_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Sebastian Bullinger, Christoph Bodensteiner, Michael Arens, Rainer Stiefelhagen
Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation with Motion-based Bilateral Networks	In this work, we study the unsupervised video object segmentation problem where moving objects are segmented without prior knowledge of these objects. First, we propose a motion-based bilateral network to estimate the background based on the motion pattern of non-object regions. The bilateral network reduces false positive regions by accurately identifying background objects. Then, we integrate the background estimate from the bilateral network with instance embeddings into a graph, which allows multiple frame reasoning with graph edges linking pixels from different frames. We classify graph nodes by defining and minimizing a cost function, and segment the video frames based on the node labels. The proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art unsupervised video object segmentation methods against the DAVIS 2016 and the FBMS-59 datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Siyang_Li_Unsupervised_Video_Object_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Siyang Li, Bryan Seybold, Alexey Vorobyov, Xuejing Lei, C.-C.

VideoMatch: Matching based Video Object Segmentation	Video object segmentation is challenging yet important in a wide variety of applications for video analysis. Recent works formulate video object segmentation as a prediction task using deep nets to achieve appealing state-of-the-art performance. Due to the formulation as a prediction task, most of these methods require fine-tuning during test time, such that the deep nets memorize the appearance of the objects of interest in the given video. However, fine-tuning is time-consuming and computationally expensive, hence the algorithms are far from real time. To address this issue, we develop a novel matching based algorithm for video object segmentation. In contrast to memorization based classification techniques, the proposed approach learns to match extracted features to a provided template without memorizing the appearance of the objects. We validate the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed method on the challenging DAVIS-2016, DAVIS-2017, Youtube-Objects and JumpCut datasets. Extensive results show that our method achieves comparable performance without fine-tuning and is much more favorable in terms of computational time.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yuan-Ting_Hu_VideoMatch_Matching_based_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yuan-Ting Hu, Jia-Bin Huang, Alexander G.

Show, Tell and Discriminate: Image Captioning by Self-retrieval with Partially Labeled Data	The aim of image captioning is to generate captions by machine to describe image contents. Despite many efforts, generating discriminative captions for images remains non-trivial. Most traditional approaches imitate the language structure patterns, thus tend to fall into a stereotype of replicating frequent phrases or sentences and neglect unique aspects of each image. In this work, we propose an image captioning framework with a self-retrieval module as training guidance, which encourages generating discriminative captions. It brings unique advantages: (1) the self-retrieval guidance can act as a metric and an evaluator of caption discriminativeness to assure the quality of generated captions. (2) The correspondence between generated captions and images are naturally incorporated in the generation process without human annotations, and hence our approach could utilize a large amount of unlabeled images to boost captioning performance with no additional laborious annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed retrieval-guided method on COCO and Flickr30k captioning datasets, and show its superior captioning performance with more discriminative captions.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xihui_Liu_Show_Tell_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xihui Liu, Hongsheng Li, Jing Shao, Dapeng Chen, Xiaogang Wang
Connecting Gaze, Scene, and Attention: Generalized Attention Estimation via Joint Modeling of Gaze and Scene Saliency	This paper addresses the challenging problem of estimating the general visual attention of people in images. Our proposed method is designed to work across multiple naturalistic social scenarios and provides a full picture of the subject's attention and gaze. In contrast, earlier works on gaze and attention estimation have focused on constrained problems in more specific contexts. In particular, our model explicitly represents the gaze direction and handles out-of-frame gaze targets. We leverage three different datasets using a multi-task learning approach. We evaluate our method on widely used benchmarks for single-tasks such as gaze angle estimation and attention-within-an-image, as well as on the new challenging task of generalized visual attention prediction. In addition, we have created extended annotations for the MMDB and GazeFollow datasets which are used in our experiments, which we will publicly release.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Eunji_Chong_Connecting_Gaze_Scene_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Eunji Chong, Nataniel Ruiz, Yongxin Wang, Yun Zhang, Agata Rozga, James M.

Local Orthogonal-Group Testing	This work addresses approximate nearest neighbor search applied in the domain of large-scale image retrieval. Within the group testing framework we propose an efficient off-line construction of the search structures. The linear-time complexity orthogonal grouping increases the probability that at most one element from each group is matching to a given query. Non-maxima suppression with each group efficiently reduces the number of false positive results at no extra cost. Unlike in other well-performing approaches, all processing is local, fast, and suitable to process data in batches and in parallel. We experimentally show that the proposed method achieves search accuracy of the exhaustive search with significant reduction in the search complexity. The method can be naturally combined with existing embedding methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ahmet_Iscen_Local_Orthogonal-Group_Testing_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ahmet Iscen, Ondrej Chum
Focus, Segment and Erase: An Efficient Network for Multi-Label Brain Tumor Segmentation	"In multi-label brain tumor segmentation, class imbalance and inter-class interference are common and challenging problems. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable network named FSENet to address the aforementioned issues. The proposed FSENet has a tumor region pooling component to restrict the prediction within the tumor region (``focus""), thus mitigating the influence of the dominant non-tumor region. Furthermore, the network decomposes the more challenging multi-label brain tumor segmentation problem into several simpler binary segmentation tasks (``segment""), where each task focuses on a specific tumor tissue. To alleviate inter-class interference, we adopt a simple yet effective idea in our work: we erase the segmented regions before proceeding to further segmentation of tumor tissue (``erase""), thus reduces competition among different tumor classes. Our single-model FSENet ranks 3rd on the multi-modal brain tumor segmentation benchmark 2015 (BraTS 2015) without relying on ensembles or complicated post-processing steps."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xuan_Chen_Focus_Segment_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xuan Chen, Jun Hao Liew, Wei Xiong, Chee-Kong Chui, Sim-Heng Ong
Textual Explanations for Self-Driving Vehicles	Deep neural perception and control networks have become key components of self-driving vehicles. User acceptance is likely to benefit from easy-to-interpret textual explanations which allow end-users to understand what triggered a particular behavior. Explanations may be triggered by the neural controller, namely introspective explanations, or informed by the neural controller's output, namely rationalizations. We propose a new approach to introspective explanations which consists of two parts. First, we use a visual (spatial) attention model to train a convolutional network end-to-end from images to the vehicle control commands, i.e., acceleration and change of course. The controller's attention identifies image regions that potentially influence the network's output. Second, we use an attention-based video-to-text model to produce textual explanations of model actions. The attention maps of controller and explanation model are aligned so that explanations are grounded in the parts of the scene that mattered to the controller. We explore two approaches to attention alignment, strong- and weak-alignment. Finally, we explore a version of our model that generates rationalizations, and compare with introspective explanations on the same video segments. We evaluate these models on a novel driving dataset with ground-truth human explanations, the Berkeley DeepDrive eXplanation (BDD-X) dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/JinkyuKimUCB/explainable-deep-driving.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jinkyu_Kim_Textual_Explanations_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jinkyu Kim, Anna Rohrbach, Trevor Darrell, John Canny, Zeynep Akata
Proximal Dehaze-Net: A Prior Learning-Based Deep Network for Single Image Dehazing	Photos taken in hazy weather are usually covered with white masks and often lose important details. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for single image dehazing by learning dark channel and transmission priors. First, we build an energy model for dehazing using dark channel and transmission priors and design an iterative optimization algorithm using proximal operators for these two priors. Second, we unfold the iterative algorithm to be a deep network, dubbed as extit{proximal dehaze-net}, by learning the proximal operators using convolutional neural networks. Our network combines the advantages of traditional prior-based dehazing methods and deep learning methods by incorporating haze-related prior learning into deep network. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for single image dehazing.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Dong_Yang_Proximal_Dehaze-Net_A_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Dong Yang, Jian Sun
Learning Rigidity in Dynamic Scenes with a Moving Camera for 3D Motion Field Estimation	Estimation of 3D motion in a dynamic scene from a temporal pair of images is a core task in many scene understanding problems. In real world applications, a dynamic scene is commonly captured by a moving camera (i.e., panning, tilting or hand-held), increasing the task complexity because the scene is observed from different view points. The main challenge is the disambiguation of the camera motion from scene motion, which becomes more difficult as the amount of rigidity observed decreases, even with successful estimation of 2D image correspondences. Compared to other state-of-the-art 3D scene flow estimation methods, in this paper we propose to emph{learn} the rigidity of a scene in a supervised manner from a large collection of dynamic scene data, and directly infer a rigidity mask from two sequential images with depths. With the learned network, we show how we can effectively estimate camera motion and projected scene flow using computed 2D optical flow and the inferred rigidity mask. For training and testing the rigidity network, we also provide a new semi-synthetic dynamic scene dataset (synthetic foreground objects with a real background) and an evaluation split that accounts for the percentage of observed non-rigid pixels. Through our evaluation, we show the proposed framework outperforms current state-of-the-art scene flow estimation methods in challenging dynamic scenes.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhaoyang_Lv_Learning_Rigidity_in_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhaoyang Lv, Kihwan Kim, Alejandro Troccoli, Deqing Sun, James M.

Quantization Mimic: Towards Very Tiny CNN for Object Detection	In this paper, we propose a simple and general framework for training very tiny CNNs for object detection. Due to limited representation ability, it is challenging to train very tiny networks for complicated tasks like detection. To the best of our knowledge, our method, called Quantization Mimic, is the first one focusing on very tiny networks. We utilize two types of acceleration methods: mimic and quantization. Mimic improves the performance of a student network by transfering knowledge from a teacher network. Quantization converts a full-precision network to a quantized one without large degradation of performance. If the teacher network is quantized, the search scope of the student network will be smaller. Using this feature of the quantization, we propose Quantization Mimic. It first quantizes the large network, then mimic a quantized small network. The quantization operation can help student network to better match the feature maps from teacher network. To evaluate our approach, we carry out experiments on various popular CNNs including VGG and Resnet, as well as different detection frameworks including Faster R-CNN and R-FCN. Experiments on Pascal VOC and WIDER FACE verify that our Quantization Mimic algorithm can be applied on various settings and outperforms state-of-the-art model acceleration methods given limited computing resouces.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yi_Wei_Quantization_Mimic_Towards_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yi Wei, Xinyu Pan, Hongwei Qin, Wanli Ouyang, Junjie Yan
Occlusions, Motion and Depth Boundaries with a Generic Network for Disparity, Optical Flow or Scene Flow Estimation	Occlusions play an important role in optical flow and disparity estimation, since matching costs are not available in occluded areas and occlusions indicate motion boundaries. Moreover, occlusions are relevant for motion segmentation and scene flow estimation. In this paper, we present an efficient learning-based approach to estimate occlusion areas jointly with optical flow or disparities. The estimated occlusions and motion boundaries clearly improve over the state of the art. Moreover, we present networks with state-of-the-art performance on the popular KITTI benchmark and good generic performance. Making use of the estimated occlusions, we also show imprved results on motion segmentation and scene flow estimation.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Eddy_Ilg_Occlusions_Motion_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Eddy Ilg, Tonmoy Saikia, Margret Keuper, Thomas Brox
CurriculumNet: Weakly Supervised Learning from Large-Scale Web Images	We present a simple yet efficient approach capable of training deep neural networks on large-scale weakly-supervised web images, which are crawled rawly from the Internet by using text queries, without any human annotation. We develop a principled learning strategy by leveraging curriculum learning, with the goal of handling massive amount of noisy labels and data imbalance effectively. We design a new learning curriculum by measuring the complexity of data using its distribution density in a feature space, and rank the complexity in an unsupervised manner. This allows for an efficient implementation of curriculum learning on large-scale web images, resulting in a high-performance CNN model, where the negative impact of noisy labels is reduced substantially. Importantly, we show by experiments that those images with highly noisy labels can surprisingly improve the generalization capability of model, by serving as a manner of regularization. Our approaches obtain the state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, including Webvision, ImageNet, Clothing-1M and Food-101. With an ensemble of multiple models, we achieve a top-5 error rate of 5.2% on the Webvision challenge cite{li2017webvision} for 1000-category classification, which is the top performance that surpasses other results by a large margin of about 50% relative error rate.

SpiderCNN: Deep Learning on Point Sets with Parameterized Convolutional Filters	Deep neural networks have enjoyed remarkable success for various vision tasks, however it remains challenging to apply CNNs to domains lacking a regular underlying structures such as 3D point clouds. Towards this we propose a novel convolutional architecture, termed SpiderCNN, to efficiently extract geometric features from point clouds. SpiderCNN is comprised of units called SpiderConv, which extend convolutional operations from regular grids to irregular point sets that can be embedded in R^n, by parametrizing a family of convolutional filters. We design the filter as a product of a simple step function that captures local geodesic information and a Taylor polynomial that ensures the expressiveness. SpiderCNN inherits the multi-scale hierarchical architecture from classical CNNs, which allows it to extract semantic deep features. Experiments on ModelNet40 demonstrate that SpiderCNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy 92.4% on standard benchmarks, and shows competitive performance on segmentation task.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yifan_Xu_SpiderCNN_Deep_Learning_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yifan Xu, Tianqi Fan, Mingye Xu, Long Zeng, Yu Qiao
R2P2: A ReparameteRized Pushforward Policy for Diverse, Precise Generative Path Forecasting	We propose a method to forecast a vehicle's ego-motion as a distribution over spatiotemporal paths, conditioned on features (e.g., from LIDAR and images) embedded in an overhead map. The method learns a policy inducing a distribution over simulated trajectories that is both diverse (produces most paths likely under the data) and precise (mostly produces paths likely under the data). This balance is achieved through minimization of a symmetrized cross-entropy between the distribution and demonstration data. By viewing the simulated-outcome distribution as the pushforward of a simple distribution under a simulation operator, we obtain expressions for the cross-entropy metrics that can be efficiently evaluated and differentiated, enabling stochastic-gradient optimization. We propose concrete policy architectures for this model, discuss our evaluation metrics relative to previously-used metrics, and demonstrate the superiority of our method relative to state-of-the-art methods in both the KITTI dataset and a similar but novel and larger real-world dataset explicitly designed for the vehicle forecasting domain.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Nicholas_Rhinehart_R2P2_A_ReparameteRized_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Nicholas Rhinehart, Kris M.

DeepTAM: Deep Tracking and Mapping	We present a system for keyframe-based dense camera tracking and depth map estimation that is entirely learned. For tracking, we estimate small pose increments between the current camera image and a synthetic viewpoint. This significantly simplifies the learning problem and alleviates the dataset bias for camera motions. Further, we show that generating a large number of pose hypotheses leads to more accurate predictions. For mapping, we accumulate information in a cost volume centered at the current depth estimate. The mapping network then combines the cost volume and the keyframe image to update the depth prediction, thereby effectively making use of depth measurements and image-based priors. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results with few images and is robust with respect to noisy camera poses. We demonstrate that the performance of our 6~DOF tracking competes with RGB-D tracking algorithms.We compare favorably against strong classic and deep learning powered dense depth algorithms.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Huizhong_Zhou_DeepTAM_Deep_Tracking_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Huizhong Zhou, Benjamin Ummenhofer, Thomas Brox
Incremental Multi-graph Matching via Diversity and Randomness based Graph Clustering	Multi-graph matching refers to finding correspondences across graphs, which are traditionally solved by matching all the graphs in a single batch. However in real-world applications, graphs are often collected incrementally, rather than once for all. In this paper, we present an incremental multi-graph matching approach, which deals with the arriving graph utilizing the previous matching results under the global consistency constraint. When a new graph arrives, rather than re-optimizing over all graphs, we propose to partition graphs into subsets with certain topological structure and conduct optimization within each subset. The partitioning procedure is guided by the diversity within partitions and randomness over iterations, and we present an interpretation showing why these two factors are essential. The final matching results are calculated over all subsets via an intersection graph. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and real image datasets show that our algorithm notably improves the efficiency without sacrificing the accuracy.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tianshu_Yu_Incremental_Multi-graph_Matching_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tianshu Yu, Junchi Yan, Wei Liu, Baoxin Li
Double JPEG Detection in Mixed JPEG Quality Factors using Deep Convolutional Neural Network	Double JPEG detection is essential for detecting various image manipulations. This paper proposes a novel deep convolutional neural network for double JPEG detection using statistical histogram features from each block with a vectorized quantization table. In contrast to previous methods, the proposed approach handles mixed JPEG quality factors and is suitable for real-world situations. We collected real-world JPEG images from the image forensic service and generated a new double JPEG dataset with 1120 quantization tables to train the network. The proposed approach was verified experimentally to produce a state-of-the-art performance, successfully detecting various image manipulations.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jin-Seok_Park_Double_JPEG_Detection_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jinseok Park, Donghyeon Cho, Wonhyuk Ahn, Heung-Kyu Lee
Selfie Video Stabilization	We propose a novel algorithm for stabilizing selfie videos. Our goal is to automatically generate stabilized video that has optimal smooth motion in the sense of both foreground and background. The key insight is that non-rigid foreground motion in selfie videos can be analyzed using a 3D face model, and background motion can be analyzed using optical flow. We use second derivative of temporal trajectory of selected pixels as the measure of smoothness. Our algorithm stabilizes selfie videos by minimizing the smoothness measure of the back-ground, regularized by the motion of the foreground. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art general video stabilization techniques in selfie videos.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jiyang_Yu_Selfie_Video_Stabilization_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jiyang Yu, Ravi Ramamoorthi
Weakly- and Semi-Supervised Panoptic Segmentation	We present a weakly supervised model that jointly performs both semantic- and instance-segmentation -- a particularly relevant problem given the substantial cost of obtaining pixel-perfect annotation for these tasks. In contrast to many popular instance segmentation approaches based on object detectors, our method does not predict any overlapping instances. Moreover, we are able to segment both ``thing'' and ``stuff'' classes, and thus explain all the pixels in the image. ``Thing'' classes are weakly-supervised with bounding boxes, and ``stuff'' with image-level tags. We obtain state-of-the-art results on Pascal VOC, for both full and weak supervision (which achieves about 95% of fully-supervised performance). Furthermore, we present the first weakly-supervised results on Cityscapes for both semantic- and instance-segmentation. Finally, we use our weakly supervised framework to analyse the relationship between annotation quality and predictive performance, which is of interest to dataset creators.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Anurag_Arnab_Weakly-_and_Semi-Supervised_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Qizhu Li, Anurag Arnab, Philip H.S.

ActiveStereoNet: End-to-End Self-Supervised Learning for Active Stereo Systems	In this paper we present ActiveStereoNet, the first deep learning solution for active stereo systems. Due to the lack of ground truth, our method is fully self-supervised, yet it produces precise depth with a subpixel precision of 1/30th of a pixel; it does not suffer from the common over-smoothing issues of previous approaches; it preserves the edges; and it explicitly handles occlusions. We introduce a novel reconstruction loss that is more robust to noise and texture-less patches, and is invariant to illumination changes. The proposed loss is optimized using a window-based cost aggregation with an adaptive support weight scheme. This cost aggregation is edge-preserving and smooths the loss function, which is key to allow the network to reach compelling results. Finally we show how the task of predicting invalid regions, such as occlusions, can be trained end-to-end without ground-truth. This component is crucial to reduce blur and particularly improves predictions along depth discontinuities. Extensive quantitatively and qualitatively evaluations on real and synthetic data demonstrate state of the art results in many challenging scenes.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yinda_Zhang_Active_Stereo_Net_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yinda Zhang, Sameh Khamis, Christoph Rhemann, Julien Valentin, Adarsh Kowdle, Vladimir Tankovich, Michael Schoenberg, Shahram Izadi, Thomas Funkhouser, Sean Fanello
BiSeNet: Bilateral Segmentation Network for Real-time Semantic Segmentation	Semantic segmentation requires both rich spatial information and sizeable receptive field. However, modern approaches usually compromise spatial resolution to achieve real-time inference speed, which leads to poor performance. In this paper, we address this dilemma with a novel Bilateral Segmentation Network (BiSeNet). We first design a Spatial Path with a small stride to preserve the spatial information and generate high-resolution features. Meanwhile, a Context Path with a fast downsampling strategy is employed to obtain sufficient receptive field. On top of the two paths, we introduce a new Feature Fusion Module to combine features efficiently. The proposed architecture makes a right balance between the speed and segmentation performance on Cityscapes, CamVid, and COCO-Stuff datasets. Specifically, for a 2048x1024 input, we achieve 68.4% Mean IOU on the Cityscapes test dataset with speed of 105 FPS on one NVIDIA Titan XP card, which is significantly faster than the existing methods with comparable performance.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Changqian_Yu_BiSeNet_Bilateral_Segmentation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Changqian Yu, Jingbo Wang, Chao Peng, Changxin Gao, Gang Yu, Nong Sang
Depth-aware CNN for RGB-D Segmentation	Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are limited by the lack of capability to handle geometric information due to the fixed grid kernel structure. The availability of depth data enables progress in RGB-D semantic segmentation with CNNs. State-of-the-art methods either use depth as additional images or process spatial information in 3D volumes or point clouds. These methods suffer from high computation and memory cost. To address these issues, we present Depth-aware CNN by introducing two intuitive, flexible and effective operations: depth-aware convolution and depth-aware average pooling. By leveraging depth similarity between pixels in the process of information propagation, geometry is seamlessly incorporated into CNN. Without introducing any additional parameters, both operators can be easily integrated into existing CNNs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on challenging RGB-D semantic segmentation benchmarks validate the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Weiyue_Wang_Depth-aware_CNN_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Weiyue Wang, Ulrich Neumann
A Hybrid Model for Identity Obfuscation by Face Replacement	As more and more personal photos are shared and tagged in social media, avoiding privacy risks such as unintended recognition, becomes increasingly challenging. We propose a new hybrid approach to obfuscate identities in photos by head replacement. Our approach combines state of the art parametric face synthesis with latest advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for data-driven image synthesis. On the one hand, the parametric part of our method gives us control over the facial parameters and allows for explicit manipulation of the identity. On the other hand, the data-driven aspects allow for adding fine details and overall realism as well as seamless blending into the scene context. In our experiments we show highly realistic output of our system that improves over the previous state of the art in obfuscation rate while preserving a higher similarity to the original image content.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Qianru_Sun_A_Hybrid_Model_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Qianru Sun, Ayush Tewari, Weipeng Xu, Mario Fritz, Christian Theobalt, Bernt Schiele
LSQ++: Lower running time and higher recall in multi-codebook quantization	Multi-codebook quantization (MCQ) is the task of expressing a set of vectors as accurately as possible in terms of discrete entries in multiple bases. Work in MCQ is heavily focused on lowering quantization error, thereby improving distance estimation and recall on benchmarks of visual descriptors at a fixed memory budget. However, recent studies and methods in this area are hard to compare against each other, because they use different datasets, different protocols, and, perhaps most importantly, different computational budgets. In this work, we first benchmark a series of MCQ baselines on an equal footing and provide an analysis of their recall-vs-runtime performance. We observe that local search quantization (LSQ) is in practice much faster than its competitors, but is not the most accurate method in all cases. We then introduce two novel improvements that render LSQ (i) more accurate and (ii) faster. These improvements are easy to implement, and define a new state of the art in MCQ.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Julieta_Martinez_LSQ_lower_runtime_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Julieta Martinez, Shobhit Zakhmi, Holger H.

Visual Coreference Resolution in Visual Dialog using Neural Module Networks	Visual dialog entails answering a series of questions grounded in an image, using dialog history as context. In addition to the challenges found in visual question answering (VQA), which can be seen as one-round dialog, visual dialog encompasses several more. We focus on one such problem called 'visual coreference resolution' that involves determining which words, typically noun phrases and pronouns, 'co-refer' to the same entity/object instance in an image. This is crucial, especially for pronouns (e.g., 'it'), as the dialog agent must first link it to a previous coreference (e.g., 'boat'), and only then can rely on the visual grounding of the coreference 'boat' to reason about the pronoun `it'. Prior work (in visual dialog) models visual coreference resolution either (a) implicitly via a memory network over history, or (b) at a coarse level for the entire question; and not explicitly at a phrase level of granularity. In this work, we propose a neural module network architecture for visual dialog by introducing two novel modules---Refer and Exclude---that perform explicit, grounded, coreference resolution at a finer word level. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on MNIST Dialog, a visually simple yet coreference-wise complex dataset, by achieving near perfect accuracy, and on VisDial, a large and challenging visual dialog dataset on real images, where our model outperforms other approaches, and is more interpretable, grounded, and consistent qualitatively.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Satwik_Kottur_Visual_Coreference_Resolution_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Satwik Kottur, Jose M.

3D Ego-Pose Estimation via Imitation Learning	Ego-pose estimation, i.e., estimating a person's 3D pose with a single wearable camera, has many potential applications in activity monitoring. For these applications, both accurate and physically plausible estimates are desired, with the latter often overlooked by existing work. Traditional computer vision-based approaches using temporal smoothing only take into account the kinematics of the motion without considering the physics that underlies the dynamics of motion, which leads to pose estimates that are physically invalid. Motivated by this, we propose a novel control-based approach to model human motion with physics simulation and use imitation learning to learn a video-conditioned control policy for ego-pose estimation. Our imitation learning framework allows us to perform domain adaption to transfer our policy trained on simulation data to real-world data. Our experiments with real egocentric videos show that our method can estimate both accurate and physically plausible 3D ego-pose sequences without observing the cameras wearer's body.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ye_Yuan_3D_Ego-Pose_Estimation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ye Yuan, Kris Kitani
Scalable Exemplar-based Subspace Clustering on Class-Imbalanced Data	Subspace clustering methods based on expressing each data point as a linear combination of a few other data points (e.g., sparse subspace clustering) have become a popular tool for unsupervised learning due to their empirical success and theoretical guarantees. However, their performance can be affected by imbalanced data distributions and large-scale datasets. This paper presents an exemplar-based subspace clustering method to tackle the problem of imbalanced and large-scale datasets. The proposed method searches for a subset of the data that best represents all data points as measured by the $ell_1$-norm of the representation coefficients. To solve our model efficiently, we introduce a farthest first search algorithm which iteratively selects the least well-represented point as an exemplar. When data comes from a union of subspaces, we prove that the computed subset contains enough exemplars from each subspace for expressing all data points even if the data are imbalanced. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods in two large-scale image datasets that are imbalanced. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on unsupervised data subset selection for a face image classification task.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chong_You_A_Scalable_Exemplar-based_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chong You, Chi Li, Daniel P.

Improving Shape Deformation in Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation	Unsupervised image-to-image translation techniques are able to map local texture between two domains, but they are typically un- successful when the domains require larger shape change. Inspired by semantic segmentation, we introduce a discriminator with dilated convo- lutions which is able to use information from across the entire image to train a more context-aware generator. This is coupled with a multi-scale perceptual loss which is better able to represent error in the underly- ing shape of objects. We demonstrate that this design is more capable of representing shape deformation in a challenging toy dataset, plus in complex mappings with significant dataset variation between humans, dolls, and anime faces, and between cats and dogs.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Aaron_Gokaslan_Improving_Shape_Deformation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Aaron Gokaslan, Vivek Ramanujan, Daniel Ritchie, Kwang In Kim, James Tompkin
Single Image Highlight Removal with a Sparse and Low-Rank Reflection Model	We propose a sparse and low-rank reflection model for specular highlight detection and removal using a single input image. This model is motivated by the observation that the specular highlight of a natural image usually has large intensity but is rather sparsely distributed while the remaining diffuse reflection can be well approximated by a linear combination of several distinct colors with a sparse and low-rank weighting matrix. We further impose the non-negativity constraint on the weighting matrix as well as the highlight component to ensure that the model is purely additive. With this reflection model, we reformulate the task of highlight removal as a constrained nuclear norm and $l_1$-norm minimization problem which can be solved effectively by the augmented Lagrange multiplier method. Experimental results show that our method performs well on both synthetic images and many real-world examples and is competitive with previous methods, especially in some challenging scenarios featuring natural illumination, hue-saturation ambiguity and strong noises.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jie_Guo_Single_Image_Highlight_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jie Guo, Zuojian Zhou, Limin Wang
Learning to Navigate for Fine-grained Classification	Fine-grained classification is challenging due to the difficulty of finding discriminative features. Finding those subtle traits that fully characterize the object is not straightforward. To handle this circumstance, we propose a novel self-supervision mechanism to effectively localize informative regions without the need of fine-grained bounding-box/part annotations. Our model, termed NTS-Net for Navigator-Teacher-Scrutinizer Network, consists of a Navigator agent, a Teacher agent and a Scrutinizer agent. In consideration of intrinsic consistency between informativeness of the regions and their probability being ground-truth class, we design a novel training paradigm, which enables Navigator to detect most informative regions under the guidance from Teacher. After that, the Scrutinizer scrutinizes the proposed regions from Navigator and makes predictions. Our model can be viewed as a multi-agent cooperation, wherein agents benefit from each other, and make progress together. NTS-Net can be trained end-to-end, while provides accurate fine-grained classification predictions as well as highly informative regions during inference. We achieve state-of-the-art performance in extensive benchmark datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ze_Yang_Learning_to_Navigate_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ze Yang, Tiange Luo, Dong Wang, Zhiqiang Hu, Jun Gao, Liwei Wang
Part-Activated Deep Reinforcement Learning for Action Prediction	In this paper, we propose a part-activated deep reinforcement learning (PA-DRL) for action prediction. Most existing methods for action prediction utilize the evolution of whole frames to model actions, which cannot avoid the noise of the current action, especially in the early prediction. Moreover, the loss of structural information of human body diminishes the capacity of features to describe actions. To address this, we design a PA-DRL to exploit the structure of the human body by extracting skeleton proposals under a deep reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we extract features from different parts of the human body individually and activate the action-related parts in features to enhance the representation. Our method not only exploits the structure information of the human body, but also considers the saliency part for expressing actions. We evaluate our method on three popular action prediction datasets: UT-Interaction, BIT-Interaction and UCF101. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the performance with state-of-the-arts.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Lei_Chen_Part-Activated_Deep_Reinforcement_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Lei Chen, Jiwen Lu, Zhanjie Song, Jie Zhou
EC-Net: an Edge-aware Point set Consolidation Network	Point clouds obtained from 3D scans are typically sparse, irregular, and noisy, and required to be consolidated. In this paper, we present the first deep learning based {em edge-aware} technique to facilitate the consolidation of point clouds. We design our network to process points grouped in local patches, and train it to learn and help consolidate points, deliberately for edges. To achieve this, we formulate a regression component to simultaneously recover 3D point coordinates and point-to-edge distances from upsampled features, and an edge-aware joint loss function to directly minimize distances from output points to 3D meshes and to edges. Compared with previous neural network based works, our consolidation is {em edge-aware/}. During the synthesis, our network can attend to the detected sharp edges and enable more accurate 3D reconstructions. Also, we trained our network on virtual scanned point clouds, demonstrated the performance of our method on both synthetic and real point clouds, presented various surface reconstruction results, and showed how our method outperforms the state-of-the-arts.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Lequan_Yu_EC-Net_an_Edge-aware_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Lequan Yu, Xianzhi Li, Chi-Wing Fu, Daniel Cohen-Or, Pheng-Ann Heng
CIRL: Controllable Imitative Reinforcement Learning for Vision-based Self-driving	Autonomous urban driving navigation with complex multi-agent dynamics is under-explored due to the difficulty of learning an optimal driving policy. The traditional modular pipeline heavily relies on hand-designed rules and the pre-processing perception system while the supervised learning-based models are limited by the accessibility of extensive human experience. We present a general and principled Controllable Imitative Reinforcement Learning (CIRL) approach which successfully makes the driving agent achieve higher success rates based on only vision inputs in a high-fidelity car simulator. To alleviate the low exploration efficiency for large continuous action space that often prohibits the use of classical RL on challenging real tasks, our CIRL explores over a reasonably constrained action space guided by encoded experiences that imitate human demonstrations, building upon Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). Moreover, we propose to specialize adaptive policies and steering-angle reward designs for different control signals (i.e. follow, straight, turn right, turn left) based on the shared representations to improve the model capability in tackling with diverse cases. Extensive experiments on CARLA driving benchmark demonstrate that CIRL substantially outperforms all previous methods in terms of the percentage of successfully completed episodes on a variety of goal-directed driving tasks. We also show its superior generalization capability in unseen environments. To our knowledge, this is the first successful case of the learned driving policy by reinforcement learning in the high-fidelity simulator, which performs better than supervised imitation learning.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiaodan_Liang_CIRL_Controllable_Imitative_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiaodan Liang, Tairui Wang, Luona Yang, Eric Xing
Fast, Accurate, and Lightweight Super-Resolution with Cascading Residual Network	In recent years, deep learning methods have been successfully applied to single-image super-resolution tasks. Despite their great performances, deep learning methods cannot be easily applied to real-world applications due to the requirement of heavy computation. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing an accurate and lightweight deep network for image super-resolution. In detail, we design an architecture that implements a cascading mechanism upon a residual network. We also present variant models of the proposed cascading residual network to further improve efficiency. Our extensive experiments show that even with much fewer parameters and operations, our models achieve performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Namhyuk_Ahn_Fast_Accurate_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Namhyuk Ahn, Byungkon Kang, Kyung-Ah Sohn
Deep Shape Matching	We cast shape matching as metric learning with convolutional networks. We break the end-to-end process of image representation into two parts. Firstly, well established efficient methods are chosen to turn the images into edge maps. Secondly, the network is trained with edge maps of landmark images, which are automatically obtained by a structure-from-motion pipeline. The learned representation is evaluated on a range of different tasks, providing improvements on challenging cases of domain generalization, generic sketch-based image retrieval or its fine-grained counterpart. In contrast to other methods that learn a different model per task, object category, or domain, we use the same network throughout all our experiments, achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple benchmarks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Filip_Radenovic_Deep_Shape_Matching_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Filip Radenovic, Giorgos Tolias, Ondrej Chum
Transductive Centroid Projection for Semi-supervised Large-scale Recognition	Conventional deep semi-supervised learning methods, such as recursive clustering and training process, suffer from cumulative error and high computational complexity when collaborating with Convolutional Neural Networks. To this end, we design a simple but effective learning mechanism that merely substitutes the last fully-connected layer with the proposed Transductive Centroid Projection (TCP) module. It is inspired by the observation of the weights in classification layer (called extit{anchors}) converge to the central direction of each class in hyperspace. Specifically, we design the TCP module by dynamically adding an extit{ad hoc anchor} for each cluster in one mini-batch. It essentially reduces the probability of the inter-class conflict and enables the unlabelled data functioning as labelled data. We inspect its effectiveness with elaborate ablation study on seven public face/person classification benchmarks. Without any bells and whistles, TCP can achieve significant performance gains over most state-of-the-art methods in both fully-supervised and semi-supervised manners.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yu_Liu_Transductive_Centroid_Projection_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yu Liu, Guanglu Song, Jing Shao, Xiao Jin, Xiaogang Wang
Self-supervised Knowledge Distillation Using Singular Value Decomposition	To solve deep neural network (DNN)'s huge training dataset and its high computation issue, so-called teacher-student (T-S) DNN which transfers the knowledge of T-DNN to S-DNN has been proposed. However, the existing T-S-DNN has limited range of use, and the knowledge of T-DNN is insufficiently transferred to S-DNN. To improve the quality of the transferred knowledge from T-DNN, we propose a new knowledge distillation using singular value decomposition (SVD). In addition, we define a knowledge transfer as a self-supervised task and suggest a way to continuously receive information from T-DNN. Simulation results show that a S-DNN with a computational cost of 1/5 of the T-DNN can be up to 1.1% better than the T-DNN in terms of classification accuracy. Also assuming the same computational cost, our S-DNN outperforms the S-DNN driven by the state-of-the-art distillation with a performance advantage of 1.79%. code is available on https://github.com/sseung0703/SSKD_SVD.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/SEUNG_HYUN_LEE_Self-supervised_Knowledge_Distillation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Seung Hyun Lee, Dae Ha Kim, Byung Cheol Song
Dynamic Task Prioritization for Multitask Learning	We propose dynamic task prioritization for multitask learning. This allows a model to dynamically prioritize difficult tasks during training, where difficulty is inversely proportional to performance, and where difficulty changes over time. In contrast to curriculum learning, where easy tasks are prioritized above difficult tasks, we present several studies showing the importance of prioritizing difficult tasks first. We observe that imbalances in task difficulty can lead to unnecessary emphasis on easier tasks, thus neglecting and slowing progress on difficult tasks. Motivated by this finding, we introduce a notion of dynamic task prioritization to automatically prioritize more difficult tasks by adaptively adjusting the mixing weight of each task's loss objective. Additional ablation studies show the impact of the task hierarchy, or the task ordering, when explicitly encoded in the network architecture. Our method outperforms existing multitask methods and demonstrates competitive results with modern single-task models on the COCO and MPII datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Michelle_Guo_Focus_on_the_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Michelle Guo, Albert Haque, De-An Huang, Serena Yeung, Li Fei-Fei
Single Shot Scene Text Retrieval	Textual information found in scene images provides high level semantic information about the image and its context and it can be leveraged for better scene understanding. In this paper we address the problem of scene text retrieval: given a text query, the system must return all images containing the queried text. The novelty of the proposed model consists in the usage of a single shot CNN architecture that predicts at the same time bounding boxes and a compact text representation of the words in them. In this way, the text based image retrieval task can be casted as a simple nearest neighbor search of the query text representation over the outputs of the CNN over the entire image database. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperforms previous state-of-the-art while it offers a significant increase in processing speed.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Lluis_Gomez_Single_Shot_Scene_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Lluis Gomez, Andres Mafla, Marcal Rusinol, Dimosthenis Karatzas
SAN: Learning Relationship between Convolutional Features for Multi-Scale Object Detection	Most of the recent successful methods in accurate object detection build on the convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, due to the lack of scale normalization in CNN-based detection methods, the activated channels in the feature space can be completely different according to a scale and this difference makes it hard for the classifier to learn samples. We propose a Scale Aware Network (SAN) that maps the convolutional features from the different scales onto a scale-invariant subspace to make CNN-based detection methods more robust to the scale variation, and also construct a unique learning method which considers purely the relationship between channels without the spatial information for the efficient learning of SAN. To show the validity of our method, we visualize how convolutional features change according to the scale through a channel activation matrix and experimentally show that SAN reduces the feature differences in the scale space. We evaluate our method on VOC PASCAL and MS COCO dataset. We demonstrate SAN by conducting several experiments on structures and parameters. The proposed SAN can be generally applied to many CNN-based detection methods to enhance the detection accuracy with a slight increase in the computing time.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Kim_SAN_Learning_Relationship_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yonghyun Kim, Bong-Nam Kang, Daijin Kim
Multimodal Dual Attention Memory for Video Story Question Answering	We propose a video story question-answering (QA) architecture, Multimodal Dual Attention Memory (MDAM). The key idea is to use a dual attention mechanism with late fusion. MDAM uses self-attention to learn the latent concepts in scene frames and captions. Given a question, MDAM uses the second attention over these latent concepts. Multimodal fusion is performed after the dual attention processes (late fusion). Using this processing pipeline, MDAM learns to infer a high-level vision-language joint representation from an abstraction of the full video content. We evaluate MDAM on PororoQA and MovieQA datasets which have large-scale QA annotations on cartoon videos and movies, respectively. For both datasets, MDAM achieves new state-of-the-art results with significant margins compared to the runner-up models. We confirm the best performance of the dual attention mechanism combined with late fusion by ablation studies. We also perform qualitative analysis by visualizing the inference mechanisms of MDAM.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Kyungmin_Kim_Multimodal_Dual_Attention_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Kyung-Min Kim, Seong-Ho Choi, Jin-Hwa Kim, Byoung-Tak Zhang
A Systematic DNN Weight Pruning Framework using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers	Weight pruning methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) have been investigated recently, but prior work in this area is mainly heuristic, iterative pruning, thereby lacking guarantees on the weight reduction ratio and convergence time. To mitigate these limitations, we present a systematic weight pruning framework of DNNs using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We first formulate the weight pruning problem of DNNs as a nonconvex optimization problem with combinatorial constraints specifying the sparsity requirements, and then adopt the ADMM framework for systematic weight pruning. By using ADMM, the original nonconvex optimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems that are solved iteratively. One of these subproblems can be solved using stochastic gradient descent, the other can be solved analytically. Besides, our method achieves a fast convergence rate. The weight pruning results are very promising and consistently outperform the prior work. On the LeNet-5 model for the MNIST data set, we achieve 71.2 times weight reduction without accuracy loss. On the AlexNet model for the ImageNet data set, we achieve 21 times weight reduction without accuracy loss. When we focus on the convolutional layer pruning for computation reductions, we can reduce the total computation by five times compared with the prior work (achieving a total of 13.4 times weight reduction in convolutional layers). Our models and codes are released at https://github.com/KaiqiZhang/admm-pruning.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tianyun_Zhang_A_Systematic_DNN_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tianyun Zhang, Shaokai Ye, Kaiqi Zhang, Jian Tang, Wujie Wen, Makan Fardad, Yanzhi Wang
On the Solvability of Viewing Graphs	A set of fundamental matrices relating pairs of cameras in some configuration can be represented as edges of a ``viewing graph''. Whether or not these fundamental matrices are generically sufficient to recover the global camera configuration depends on the structure of this graph. We study characterizations of ``solvable'' viewing graphs, and present several new results that can be applied to determine which pairs of views may be used to recover all camera parameters. We also discuss strategies for verifying the solvability of a graph computationally.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Matthew_Trager_On_the_Solvability_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Matthew Trager, Brian Osserman, Jean Ponce
DeepPhys: Video-Based Physiological Measurement Using Convolutional Attention Networks	Non-contact video-based physiological measurement has many applications in health care and human-computer interaction. Practical applications require measurements to be accurate even in the presence of large head rotations. We propose the first end-to-end system for video-based measurement of heart and breathing rate using a deep convolutional network. The system features a new motion representation based on a skin reflection model and a new attention mechanism using appearance information to guide motion estimation, both of which enable robust measurement under heterogeneous lighting and major motions. Our approach significantly outperforms all current state-of-the-art methods on both RGB and infrared video datasets. Furthermore, it allows spatial-temporal distributions of physiological signals to be visualized via the attention mechanism.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Weixuan_Chen_DeepPhys_Video-Based_Physiological_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Weixuan Chen, Daniel McDuff
Iterative Crowd Counting	In this work, we tackle the problem of crowd counting in images. We present a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based density estimation approach to solve this problem. Predicting a high resolution density map in one go is a challenging task. Hence, we present a two branch CNN architecture for generating high resolution density maps, where the first branch generates a low resolution density map and the second branch incorporates the prediction and feature maps from the first branch to generate a high resolution density map. We also propose a multi-stage extension of our approach where each stage in the pipeline utilizes the predictions from all the previous stages. Empirical comparison with the previous state-of-the-art crowd counting methods shows that our method achieves the lowest mean absolute error on three challenging crowd counting benchmarks: Shanghaitech, WorldExpo'10, and UCF datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Viresh_Ranjan_Iterative_Crowd_Counting_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Viresh Ranjan, Hieu Le, Minh Hoai
End-to-end View Synthesis for Light Field Imaging with Pseudo 4DCNN	Limited angular resolution has become the main bottleneck of microlens-based plenoptic cameras towards practical vision applications. Existing view synthesis methods mainly break the task into two steps, i.e. depth estimating and view warping, which are usually inefficient and produce artifacts over depth ambiguities. In this paper, an end-to-end deep learning framework is proposed to solve these problems by exploring Pseudo 4DCNN. Specifically, 2D strided convolutions operated on stacked EPIs and detail-restoration 3D CNNs connected with angular conversion are assembled to build the Pseudo 4DCNN. The key advantage is to efficiently synthesize dense 4D light fields from a sparse set of input views. The learning framework is well formulated as an entirely trainable problem, and all the weights can be recursively updated with standard backpropagation. The proposed framework is compared with state-of-the-art approaches on both genuine and synthetic light field databases, which achieves significant improvements of both image quality (+2dB higher) and computational efficiency (over 10X faster). Furthermore, the proposed framework shows good performances in real-world applications such as biometrics and depth estimation.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yunlong_Wang_End-to-end_View_Synthesis_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yunlong Wang, Fei Liu, Zilei Wang, Guangqi Hou, Zhenan Sun, Tieniu Tan
Dependency-aware Attention Control for Unconstrained Face Recognition with Image Sets	This paper targets the problem of image set-based face verification and identification. Unlike traditional single media (an image or video) setting, we encounter a set of heterogeneous contents containing orderless images and videos. The importance of each image is usually considered either equal or based on their independent quality assessment. How to model the relationship of orderless images within a set remains a challenge. We address this problem by formulating it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) at the feature level. Specifically, we propose a dependency-aware attention control (DAC) network, which resorts to actor-critic reinforcement learning for sequential attention decision of each image embedding to fully exploit the rich correlation cues among the unordered images. Moreover, its sample-efficient variant with off-policy experience replay is introduced to speed up the learning process. The pose-guided representation scheme can further boost the performance at the extremes of the pose variation. We show that our method leads to the state-of-the-art accuracy on IJB-A dataset and also generalizes well in several video-based face recognition tasks, extit{e.g.}, YTF and Celebrity-1000.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiaofeng_Liu_Dependency-aware_Attention_Control_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiaofeng Liu, B.V.K Vijaya Kumar, Chao Yang, Qingming Tang, Jane You
SOD-MTGAN: Small Object Detection via Multi-Task Generative Adversarial Network	Object detection is a fundamental and important problem in computer vision. Although impressive results have been achieved on large/medium sized objects on large-scale detection benchmarks (e.g. the COCO dataset), the performance on small objects is far from satisfaction. The reason is that small objects lack sufficient detailed appearance information, which can distinguish them from the background or similar objects. To deal with small object detection problem, we propose an end-to-end multi-task generative adversarial network (MTGAN). In the MTGAN, the generator is a super-resolution network, which can up-sample small blurred images into fine-scale ones and recover detailed information for more accurate detection. The discriminator is a multi task network, which describes each super-resolution image patch with a real/fake score, object category scores, and bounding box regression off sets. Furthermore, to make the generator recover more details for easier detection, the classification and regression losses in the discriminator are back-propagated into the generator during training. Extensive experiments on the challenging COCO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in restoring a clear super-resolution image from a blurred small one, and show that the detection performance, especially for small sized objects, improves over state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yongqiang_Zhang_SOD-MTGAN_Small_Object_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yancheng Bai, Yongqiang Zhang, Mingli Ding, Bernard Ghanem
Inner Space Preserving Generative Pose Machine	Image-based generative methods, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) have already been able to generate realistic images with much context control, specially when they are conditioned. However, most successful frameworks share a common procedure which performs an image-to-image translation with pose of figures in the image untouched. When the objective is reposing a figure in an image while preserving the rest of the image, the state-of-the-art mainly assumes a single rigid body with simple background and limited pose shift, which can hardly be extended to the images under normal settings. In this paper, we introduce an image ``inner space'' preserving model that assigns an interpretable low-dimensional pose descriptor (LDPD) to an articulated figure in the image. Figure reposing is then generated by passing the LDPD and the original image through multi-stage augmented hourglass networks in a conditional GAN structure, called inner space preserving generative pose machine (ISP-GPM). We evaluated ISP-GPM on reposing human figures, which are highly articulated with versatile variations. Test of a state-of-the-art pose estimator on our reposed dataset gave an accuracy over 80% on PCK0.5 metric. The results also elucidated that our ISP-GPM is able to preserve the background with high accuracy while reasonably recovering the area blocked by the figure to be reposed.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Shuangjun_Liu_Inner_Space_Preserving_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Shuangjun Liu, Sarah Ostadabbas
Contextual-based Image Inpainting: Infer, Match, and Translate	We study the task of image inpainting, which is to fill in the missing region of an incomplete image with plausible contents. To this end, we propose a learning-based approach to generate visually coherent completion given a high-resolution image with missing components. In order to overcome the difficulty to directly learn the distribution of high-dimensional image data, we divide the task into inference and translation as two separate steps and model each step with a deep neural network. We also use simple heuristics to guide the propagation of local textures from the boundary to the hole. We show that, by using such techniques, inpainting reduces to the problem of learning two image-feature translation functions in much smaller space and hence easier to train. We evaluate our method on several public datasets and show that we generate results of better visual quality than previous state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yuhang_Song_Contextual_Based_Image_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yuhang Song, Chao Yang, Zhe Lin, Xiaofeng Liu, Qin Huang, Hao Li, C.-C.

GAL: Geometric Adversarial Loss for Single-View 3D-Object Reconstruction	In this paper, we present a framework for reconstructing a point-based 3D model of an object from a single view image. Distance metrics, like Chamfer distance, were used in previous work to measure the difference of two point sets and serve as the loss function in point-based reconstruction. However, such point-point loss does not constrain the 3D model from a global perspective. We propose to add geometric adversarial loss (GAL). It is composed of two terms where the geometric loss ensures consistent shape of reconstructed 3D models close to ground-truth from different viewpoints, and the conditional adversarial loss generates a semantically-meaningful point cloud.

Women also Snowboard: Overcoming Bias in Captioning Models	Most machine learning methods are known to capture and exploit biases of the training data. While some biases are beneficial for learning, others are harmful. Specifically, image captioning models tend to exaggerate biases present in training data (e.g., if a word is present in 60% of training sentences, it might be predicted in 70% of sentences at test time). This can lead to incorrect captions in domains where unbiased captions are desired, or required, due to over-reliance on the learned prior and image context. In this work we investigate generation of gender-specific caption words (e.g. man, woman) based on the person's appearance or the image context. We introduce a new Equalizer model that encourages equal gender probability when gender evidence is occluded in a scene and confident predictions when gender evidence is present. The resulting model is forced to look at a person rather than use contextual cues to make a gender-specific prediction. The losses that comprise our model, the Appearance Confusion Loss and the Confident Loss, are general, and can be added to any description model in order to mitigate impacts of unwanted bias in a description dataset. Our proposed model has lower error than prior work when describing images with people and mentioning their gender and more closely matches the ground truth ratio of sentences including women to sentences including men. Finally, we show that our model more often looks at people when predicting their gender.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Lisa_Anne_Hendricks_Women_also_Snowboard_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Lisa Anne Hendricks, Kaylee Burns, Kate Saenko, Trevor Darrell, Anna Rohrbach
Correcting the Triplet Selection Bias for Triplet Loss	Triplet loss, popular for metric learning, has made a great success in many computer vision tasks, such as fine-grained image classification, image retrieval, and face recognition. Considering that the number of triplets grows cubically with the size of training data, triplet mining is thus indispensable for efficiently training with triplet loss. However, in practice, the training is usually very sensitive to the selected triplets, e.g., it almost does not converge with randomly selected triplets and selecting hardest triplets also leads to bad local minima. We argue that the bias in sampling of triplets degrades the performance of learning with triplet loss. In this paper, we propose a new variant of triplet loss, which tries to reduce the bias in triplet sampling by adaptively correcting the distribution shift on sampled triplets. We refer to this new triplet loss as adapted triplet loss. We conduct a number of experiments on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST for image classification, and on CARS196, CUB200-2011, and Stanford Online Products for image retrieval. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Baosheng_Yu_Correcting_the_Triplet_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Baosheng Yu, Tongliang Liu, Mingming Gong, Changxing Ding, Dacheng Tao
X2Face: A network for controlling face generation using images, audio, and pose codes	The objective of this paper is a neural network model that controls the pose and expression of a given face, using another face or modality (e.g. audio). This model can then be used for lightweight, sophisticated video and image editing. We make the following three contributions. First, we introduce a network, X2Face, that can control a source face (specified by one or more frames) using another face in a driving frame to produce a generated frame with the identity of the source frame but the pose and expression of the face in the driving frame. Second, we propose a method for training the network fully self-supervised using a large collection of video data. Third, we show that the generation process can be driven by other modalities, such as audio or pose codes, without any further training of the network. The generation results for driving a face with another face are compared to state-of-the-art self-supervised/supervised methods. We show that our approach is more robust than other methods, as it makes fewer assumptions about the input data. We also show examples of using our framework for video face editing.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Olivia_Wiles_X2Face_A_network_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Olivia Wiles, A.

Deep Reinforcement Learning with Iterative Shift for Visual Tracking	Visual tracking is confronted by the dilemma to locate a target both}accurately and efficiently, and make decisions online whether and how to adapt the appearance model or even restart tracking. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning with iterative shift (DRL-IS) method for single object tracking, where an actor-critic network is introduced to predict the iterative shifts of object bounding boxes, and evaluate the shifts to take actions on whether to update object models or re-initialize tracking. Since locating an object is achieved by an iterative shift process, rather than online classification on many sampled locations, the proposed method is robust to cope with large deformations and abrupt motion, and computationally efficient since finding a target takes up to 10 shifts. In offline training, the critic network guides to learn how to make decisions jointly on motion estimation and tracking status in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on the OTB benchmarks with large deformation improve the tracking precision by 1.7% and runs about 5 times faster than the competing state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Liangliang_Ren_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Liangliang Ren, Xin Yuan, Jiwen Lu, Ming Yang, Jie Zhou
Semi-Supervised Deep Learning with Memory	"We consider the semi-supervised multi-class classification problem of learning from sparse labelled and abundant unlabelled training data. To address this problem, existing semi-supervised deep learning methods often rely on the up-to-date ""network-in-training"" to formulate the semi-supervised learning objective. This ignores both the discriminative feature representation and the model inference uncertainty revealed by the network in the preceding learning iterations, referred to as the memory of model learning. In this work, we propose a novel Memory-Assisted Deep Neural Network (MA-DNN) capable of exploiting the memory of model learning to enable semi-supervised learning. Specifically, we introduce a memory mechanism into the network training process as an assimilation-accommodation interaction between the network and an external memory module. Experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed MA-DNN model over the state-of-the-art semi-supervised deep learning methods on three image classification benchmark datasets: SVHN, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yanbei_Chen_Semi-Supervised_Deep_Learning_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yanbei Chen, Xiatian Zhu, Shaogang Gong
Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation using Motion Saliency-Guided Spatio-Temporal Propagation	Unsupervised video segmentation plays an important role in a wide variety of applications from object identification to compression. However, to date, fast motion, motion blur and occlusions pose significant challenges. To address these challenges for unsupervised video segmentation, we develop a novel saliency estimation technique as well as a novel neighborhood graph, based on optical flow and edge cues. Our approach leads to significantly better initial foreground-background estimates and their robust as well as accurate diffusion across time. We evaluate our proposed algorithm on the challenging DAVIS, SegTrack v2 and FBMS-59 datasets. Despite the usage of only a standard edge detector trained on 200 images, our method achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming deep learning based methods in the unsupervised setting. We even demonstrate competitive results comparable to deep learning based methods in the semi-supervised setting on the DAVIS dataset.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yuan-Ting_Hu_Unsupervised_Video_Object_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yuan-Ting Hu, Jia-Bin Huang, Alexander G.

MPLP++: Fast, Parallel Dual Block-Coordinate Ascent for Dense Graphical Models	Dense, discrete Graphical Models with pairwise potentials are a powerful class of models which are employed in state-of-the-art computer vision and bio-imaging applications. This work introduces a new MAP-solver, based on the popular Dual Block-Coordinate Ascent principle. Surprisingly, by making a small change to a low-performing solver, the Max Product Linear Programming (MPLP) algorithm, we derive the new solver MPLP++ that significantly outperforms all existing solvers by a large margin, including the state-of-the-art solver Tree-Reweighted Sequential (TRW-S) message-passing algorithm. Additionally, our solver is highly parallel, in contrast to TRW-S, which gives a further boost in performance with the proposed GPU and multi-thread CPU implementations. We verify the superiority of our algorithm on dense problems from publicly available benchmarks, as well, as a new benchmark for 6D Object Pose estimation. We also provide an ablation study with respect to graph density.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Siddharth_Tourani_MPLP_Fast_Parallel_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Siddharth Tourani, Alexander Shekhovtsov, Carsten Rother, Bogdan Savchynskyy
SRDA: Generating Instance Segmentation Annotation via Scanning, Reasoning and Domain Adaptation	Instance segmentation is a problem of significance in computer vision. However, preparing annotated data for this task is extremely time-consuming and costly. By combining the advantages of 3D scanning, reasoning, and GAN-based domain adaptation techniques, we introduce a novel pipeline named SRDA to obtain large quantities of training samples with very minor effort. Our pipeline is well-suited to scenes that can be scanned, i.e. most indoor and some outdoor scenarios. To evaluate our performance, we build three representative scenes and a new dataset, with 3D models of various common objects categories and annotated real-world scene images. Extensive experiments show that our pipeline can achieve decent instance segmentation performance given very low human labor cost.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Wenqiang_Xu_SRDA_Generating_Instance_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Wenqiang Xu, Yonglu Li, Cewu Lu
Deep Generative Models for Weakly-Supervised Multi-Label Classification	In order to train learning models for multi-label classification (MLC), it is typically desirable to have a large amount of fully annotated multi-label data. Since such annotation process is in general costly, we focus on the learning task of weakly-supervised multi-label classification (WS-MLC). In this paper, we tackle WS-MLC by learning deep generative models for describing the collected data. In particular, we introduce a sequential network architecture for constructing our generative model with the ability to approximate observed data posterior distributions. We show that how information of training data with missing labels or unlabeled ones can be exploited, which allows us to learn multi-label classifiers via scalable variational inferences. Empirical studies on various scales of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, which performs favorably against state-of-the-art MLC algorithms.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hong-Min_Chu_Deep_Generative_Models_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hong-Min Chu, Chih-Kuan Yeh, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang
Grassmann Pooling as Compact Homogeneous Bilinear Pooling for Fine-Grained Visual Classification	"Designing discriminative and invariant features is the key to visual recognition. Recently, the bilinear pooled feature matrix of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a range of fine-grained visual recognition tasks. The bilinear feature matrix collects second-order statistics and is closely related to the covariance matrix descriptor. However, the bilinear feature could suffer from the visual burstiness phenomenon similar to other visual representations such as VLAD and Fisher Vector. The reason is that the bilinear feature matrix is sensitive to the magnitudes and correlations of local CNN feature elements which can be measured by its singular values. On the other hand, the singular vectors are more invariant and reasonable to be adopted as the feature representation. Motivated by this point, we advocate an alternative pooling method which transforms the CNN feature matrix to an orthonormal matrix consists of its principal singular vectors. Geometrically, such orthonormal matrix lies on the Grassmann manifold, a Riemannian manifold whose points represent subspaces of the Euclidean space. Similarity measurement of images reduces to comparing the principal angles between these ``homogeneous"" subspaces and thus is independent of the magnitudes and correlations of local CNN activations. In particular, we demonstrate that the projection distance on the Grassmann manifold deduces a bilinear feature mapping without explicitly computing the bilinear feature matrix, which enables a very compact feature and classifier representation. Experimental results show that our method achieves an excellent balance of model complexity and accuracy on a variety of fine-grained image classification datasets."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xing_Wei_Grassmann_Pooling_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xing Wei, Yue Zhang, Yihong Gong, Jiawei Zhang, Nanning Zheng
ShapeStacks: Learning Vision-Based Physical Intuition for Generalised Object Stacking	Physical intuition is pivotal for intelligent agents to perform complex tasks. In this paper we investigate the passive acquisition of an intuitive understanding of physical principles as well as the active utilisation of this intuition in the context of generalised object stacking. To this end, we provide ShapeStacks: a simulation-based dataset featuring 20,000 stack configurations composed of a variety of elementary geometric primitives richly annotated regarding semantics and structural stability. We train visual classifiers for binary stability prediction on the ShapeStacks data and scrutinise their learned physical intuition. Due to the richness of the training data our approach also generalises favourably to real-world scenarios achieving state-of-the-art stability prediction on a publicly available benchmark of block towers. We then leverage the physical intuition learned by our model to actively construct stable stacks and observe the emergence of an intuitive notion of stackability - an inherent object affordance - induced by the active stacking task. Our approach performs well exceeding the stack height observed during training and even manages to counterbalance initially unstable structures.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Oliver_Groth_ShapeStacks_Learning_Vision-Based_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Oliver Groth, Fabian B.

HBE: Hand Branch Ensemble Network for Real-time 3D Hand Pose Estimation	The goal of this paper is to estimate the 3D coordinates of the hand joints from a single depth image. To give consideration to both the accuracy and the real time performance, we design a novel three-branch Convolutional Neural Networks named Hand Branch Ensemble network (HBE), where the three branches correspond to the three parts of a hand: the thumb, the index finger and the other fingers. The structural design inspiration of the HBE network comes from the understanding of the differences in the functional importance of different fingers. In addition, a feature ensemble layer along with a low-dimensional embedding layer ensures the overall hand shape constraints. The experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves comparable or better performance to state-of-the-art methods with less training data, shorter training time and faster frame rate.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yidan_Zhou_HBE_Hand_Branch_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yidan Zhou, Jian Lu, Kuo Du, Xiangbo Lin, Yi Sun, Xiaohong Ma
PPF-FoldNet: Unsupervised Learning of Rotation Invariant 3D Local Descriptors	We present PPF-FoldNet for unsupervised learning of 3D local descriptors on pure point cloud geometry. Based on the folding-based auto-encoding of well known point pair features, PPF-FoldNet offers many desirable properties: it necessitates neither supervision, nor a sensitive local reference frame, benefits from point-set sparsity, is end-to-end, fast, and can extract powerful rotation invariant descriptors. Thanks to a novel feature visualization, its evolution can be monitored to provide interpretable insights. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that despite having six degree-of-freedom invariance and lack of training labels, our network achieves state of the art results in standard benchmark datasets and outperforms its competitors when rotations and varying point densities are present. PPF-FoldNet achieves $9%$ higher recall on standard benchmarks, $23%$ higher recall when rotations are introduced into the same datasets and finally, a margin of $>35%$ is attained when point density is significantly decreased.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tolga_Birdal_PPF-FoldNet_Unsupervised_Learning_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Haowen Deng, Tolga Birdal, Slobodan Ilic
PlaneMatch: Patch Coplanarity Prediction for Robust RGB-D Reconstruction	We introduce a novel RGB-D patch descriptor designed for detecting coplanar surfaces in SLAM reconstruction. The core of our method is a deep convolutional neural net that takes in RGB, depth, and normal information of a planar patch in an image and outputs a descriptor that can be used to find coplanar patches from other images. We train the network on 10 million triplets of coplanar and non-coplanar patches, and evaluate on a new coplanarity benchmark created from commodity RGB-D scans. Experiments show that our learned descriptor outperforms alternatives extended for this new task by a significant margin. In addition, we demonstrate the benefits of coplanarity matching in a robust RGBD reconstruction formulation. We find that coplanarity constraints detected with our method are sufficient to get reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art frameworks on most scenes, but outperform other methods on standard benchmarks when combined with a simple keypoint method.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yifei_Shi_PlaneMatch_Patch_Coplanarity_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yifei Shi, Kai Xu, Matthias Niessner, Szymon Rusinkiewicz, Thomas Funkhouser
Deep Multi-Task Learning to Recognise Subtle Facial Expressions of Mental States	Facial expression recognition is a topical task. However, very little research investigates subtle expression recognition, which is important for mental activity analysis, deception detection, etc. We address subtle expression recognition through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by developing multi-task learning (MTL) to effectively leverage a side task: facial landmark detection. Existing MTL methods follow a design pattern of shared bottom CNN layers and task-specific top layers. However, the sharing architecture is usually heuristically chosen, as it is difficult to decide which layers should be shared. Our approach is composed of (1) a novel MTL framework that automatically learns which layers to share through optimisation under tensor trace norm regularisation and (2) an invariant representation learning approach that allows the CNN to leverage tasks defined on disjoint datasets without suffering from dataset distribution shift. To advance subtle expression recognition, we contribute a Large-scale Subtle Emotions and Mental States in the Wild database (LSEMSW). LSEMSW includes a variety of cognitive states as well as basic emotions. It contains 176K images, manually annotated with 13 emotions, and thus provides the first subtle expression dataset large enough for training deep CNNs. Evaluations on LSEMSW and 300-W (landmark) databases show the effectiveness of the proposed methods. In addition, we investigate transferring knowledge learned from LSEMSW database to traditional (non-subtle) expression recognition. We achieve very competitive performance on Oulu-Casia NIR&Vis and CK+ databases via transfer learning.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Guosheng_Hu_Deep_Multi-Task_Learning_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Guosheng Hu, Li Liu, Yang Yuan, Zehao Yu, Yang Hua, Zhihong Zhang, Fumin Shen, Ling Shao, Timothy Hospedales, Neil Robertson, Yongxin Yang
Where Will They Go? Predicting Fine-Grained Adversarial Multi-Agent Motion using Conditional Variational Autoencoders	"Simultaneously and accurately forecasting the behavior of many interacting agents is imperative for computer vision applications to be widely deployed (e.g., autonomous vehicles, security, surveillance, sports). In this paper, we present a technique using conditional variational autoencoder which learns a model that ""personalizes'' prediction to individual agent behavior within a group representation. Given the volume of data available and its adversarial nature, we focus on the sport of basketball and show that our approach efficiently predicts context-specific agent motions.

License Plate Detection and Recognition in Unconstrained Scenarios	Despite the large number of both commercial and academic methods for Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR), most existing approaches are focused on a specific license plate (LP) region (e.g. European, US, Brazilian, Taiwanese, etc.), and frequently explore datasets containing approximately frontal images. This work proposes a complete ALPR system focusing on unconstrained capture scenarios, where the LP might be considerably distorted due to oblique views. Our main contribution is the introduction of a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of detecting and rectifying multiple distorted license plates in a single image, which are fed to an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) method to obtain the final result. As an additional contribution, we also present manual annotations for a challenging set of LP images from different regions and acquisition conditions. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed method, without any parameter adaptation or fine tuning for a specific scenario, performs similarly to state-of-the-art commercial systems in traditional datasets, and outperforms both academic and commercial approaches in challenging datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Sergio_Silva_License_Plate_Detection_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Sergio Montazzolli Silva, Claudio Rosito Jung
Multi-Scale Structure-Aware Network for Human Pose Estimation	We develop a robust multi-scale structure-aware neural network for human pose estimation. This method improves the recent deep conv-deconv hourglass models with four key improvements: (1) multi-scale supervision to strengthen contextual feature learning in matching body keypoints by combining feature heatmaps across scales, (2) multi-scale regression network at the end to globally optimize the structural matching of the multi-scale features, (3) structure-aware loss used in the intermediate supervision and at the regression to improve the matching of keypoints and respective neighbors to infer a higher-order matching configurations, and (4) a keypoint masking training scheme that can effectively fine-tune our network to robustly localize occluded keypoints via adjacent matches. Our method can effectively improve state-of-the-art pose estimation methods that suffer from difficulties in scale varieties, occlusions, and complex multi-person scenarios. This multi-scale supervision tightly integrates with the regression network to effectively (i) localize keypoints using the ensemble of multi-scale features, and (ii) infer global pose configuration by maximizing structural consistencies across multiple keypoints and scales. The keypoint masking training enhances these advantages to focus learning on hard occlusion samples. Our method achieves the leading position in the MPII challenge leaderboard among the state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Lipeng_Ke_Multi-Scale_Structure-Aware_Network_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Lipeng Ke, Ming-Ching Chang, Honggang Qi, Siwei Lyu
Hierarchy of Alternating Specialists for Scene Recognition	We introduce a method for improving convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for scene classification. We present a hierarchy of specialist networks, which disentangles the intra-class variation and inter-class similarity in a coarse to fine manner. Our key insight is that each subset within a class is often associated with different types of inter-class similarity. This suggests that existing network of experts approaches that organize classes into coarse categories are suboptimal. In contrast, we group images based on high-level appearance features rather than their class membership and dedicate a specialist model per group. In addition, we propose an alternating architecture with a global ordered- and a global orderless-representation to account for both the coarse layout of the scene and the transient objects. We demonstrate that it leads to better performance than using a single type of representation as well as the fused features. We also introduce a mini-batch soft k-means that allows end-to-end fine-tuning, as well as a novel routing function for assigning images to specialists. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a significant improvement over baselines including the existing tree-structured CNNs with class-based grouping.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hyo_Jin_Kim_Hierarchy_of_Alternating_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hyo Jin Kim, Jan-Michael Frahm
Adaptive Affinity Fields for Semantic Segmentation	Existing semantic segmentation methods mostly rely on per-pixel supervision, unable to capture structural regularity present in natural images. Instead of learning to enforce semantic labels on individual pixels, we propose to enforce affinity field patterns in individual pixel neighbourhoods, i.e., the semantic label patterns of whether neighbour pixels are in the same segment should match between the prediction and the ground-truth. The affinity fields thus characterize the intrinsic geometric relationships inside a given scene, such as ``motorcycles have round wheels''. We further develop a novel method for learning the optimal neighbourhood size for each semantic category, with an adversarial loss that optimizes over worst-case scenarios. Unlike the popular Conditional Random Field approaches, our adaptive affinity field method has no extra parameters during inference, and is also less sensitive to input appearance changes. Extensive evaluations on Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC 2012 and GTA5 datasets demonstrate AAF provides an effective, efficient, and robust solution for semantic segmentation.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jyh-Jing_Hwang_Adaptive_Affinity_Field_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tsung-Wei Ke, Jyh-Jing Hwang, Ziwei Liu , Stella X.

Human Motion Analysis with Deep Metric Learning	Effectively measuring the similarity between two human motions is necessary for several computer vision tasks such as gait analysis, person identification and action retrieval. Nevertheless, we believe that traditional approaches such as L2 distance or Dynamic Time Warping based on hand-crafted local pose metrics fail to appropriately capture the semantic relationship across motions and, as such, are not suitable for being employed as metrics within these tasks. This work addresses this limitation by means of a triplet-based deep metric learning specifically tailored to deal with human motion data, in particular with the problem of varying input size and computationally expensive hard negative mining due to motion pair alignment. Specifically, we propose (1) a novel metric learning objective based on a triplet architecture and Maximum Mean Discrepancy; as well as, (2) a novel deep architecture based on attentive recurrent neural networks. One benefit of our objective function is that it enforces a better separation within the learned embedding space of the different motion categories by means of the associated distribution moments. At the same time, our attentive recurrent neural network allows processing varying input sizes to a fixed size of embedding while learning to focus on those motion parts that are semantically distinctive. Our experiments on two different datasets demonstrate significant improvements over conventional human motion metrics.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/HUSEYIN_COSKUN_Human_Motion_Analysis_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Huseyin Coskun, David Joseph Tan, Sailesh Conjeti, Nassir Navab, Federico Tombari
Long-term Tracking in the Wild: a Benchmark	"We introduce the OxUvA dataset and benchmark for evaluating single-object tracking algorithms. Benchmarks have enabled great strides in the field of object tracking by defining standardized evaluations on large sets of diverse videos. However, these works have focused exclusively on sequences that are just tens of seconds in length and in which the target is always visible. Consequently, most researchers have designed methods tailored to this ""short-term"" scenario, which is poorly representative of practitioners' needs. Aiming to address this disparity, we compile a long-term, large-scale tracking dataset of sequences with average length greater than two minutes and with frequent target object disappearance. The OxUvA dataset is much larger than the object tracking datasets of recent years: it comprises 366 sequences spanning 14 hours of video. We assess the performance of several algorithms, considering both the ability to locate the target and to determine whether it is present or absent. Our goal is to offer the community a large and diverse benchmark to enable the design and evaluation of tracking methods ready to be used ""in the wild"".

Extending Layered Models to 3D Motion	We consider the problem of inferring a layered representa-tion, its depth ordering and motion segmentation from a video in whichobjects may undergo 3D non-planar motion relative to the camera. Wegeneralize layered inference to the aforementioned case and correspond-ing self-occlusion phenomena. We accomplish this by introducing a flat-tened 3D object representation, which is a compact representation of anobject that contains all visible portions of the object seen in the video,including parts of an object that are self-occluded (as well as occluded)in one frame but seen in another. We formulate the inference of such flat-tened representations and motion segmentation, and derive an optimiza-tion scheme. We also introduce a new depth ordering scheme, which isindependent of layered inference and addresses the case of self-occlusion.It requires almost no computation given the flattened representations.Experiments on benchmark datasets show the advantage of our methodcompared to existing layered methods, which do not model 3D motionand self-occlusion.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Dong_Lao_Extending_Layered_Models_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Dong Lao, Ganesh Sundaramoorthi
A Framework for Evaluating 6-DOF Object Trackers	We present a challenging and realistic novel dataset for evaluating 6-DOF object tracking algorithms. Existing datasets show serious limitations---notably, unrealistic synthetic data, or real data with large fiducial markers---preventing the community from obtaining an accurate picture of the state-of-the-art. Using a data acquisition pipeline based on a commercial motion capture system for acquiring accurate ground truth poses of real objects with respect to a Kinect V2 camera, we build a dataset which contains a total of 297 calibrated sequences. They are acquired in three different scenarios to evaluate the performance of trackers: stability, robustness to occlusion and accuracy during challenging interactions between a person and the object. We conduct an extensive study of a deep 6-DOF tracking architecture and determine a set of optimal parameters. We enhance the architecture and the training methodology to train a 6-DOF tracker that can robustly generalize to objects never seen during training, and demonstrate favorable performance compared to previous approaches trained specifically on the objects to track.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Mathieu_Garon_A_Framework_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Mathieu Garon, Denis Laurendeau, Jean-Francois Lalonde
RESOUND: Towards Action Recognition without Representation Bias	While large datasets have proven to be a key enabler for progress in computer vision, they can have biases that lead to erroneous conclusions. The notion of the representation bias of a dataset is proposed to combat this problem. It captures the fact that representations other than the ground-truth representation can achieve good performance on any given dataset. When this is the case, the dataset is said not to be well calibrated. Dataset calibration is shown to be a necessary condition for the standard state-of-the-art evaluation practice to converge to the ground-truth representation. A procedure, RESOUND, is proposed to quantify and minimize representation bias. Its application to the problem of action recognition shows that current datasets are biased towards static representations (objects, scenes and people). Two versions of RESOUND are studied. An Explicit RESOUND procedure is proposed to assemble new datasets by sampling existing datasets. An implicit RESOUND procedure is used to guide the creation of a new dataset, Diving48, of over 18,000 video clips of competitive diving actions, spanning 48 fine-grained dive classes. Experimental evaluation confirms the effectiveness of RESOUND to reduce the static biases of current datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yingwei_Li_RESOUND_Towards_Action_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yingwei Li, Yi Li, Nuno Vasconcelos
Specular-to-Diffuse Translation for Multi-View Reconstruction	"Most multi-view 3D reconstruction algorithms, especially when shape-from-shading cues are used, assume that object appearance is predominantly diffuse. To alleviate this restriction, we introduce S2Dnet, a generative adversarial network for transferring multiple views of objects with specular reflection into diffuse ones, so that multi-view reconstruction methods can be applied more effectively. Our network extends unsupervised image-to-image translation to multi-view ``specular to diffuse"" translation. To preserve object appearance across multiple views, we introduce a Multi-View Coherence loss (MVC) that evaluates the similarity and faithfulness of local patches after the view-transformation. Our MVC loss ensures that the similarity of local correspondences among multi-view images is preserved under the image-to-image translation. As a result, our network yields significantly better results than several single-view baseline techniques. In addition, we carefully design and generate a large synthetic training data set using physically-based rendering. During testing, our network takes only the raw glossy images as input, without extra information such as segmentation masks or lighting estimation. Results demonstrate that multi-view reconstruction can be significantly improved using the images filtered by our network. We also show promising performance on real world training and testing data."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Shihao_Wu_Specular-to-Diffuse_Translation_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Shihao Wu, Hui Huang, Tiziano Portenier, Matan Sela, Daniel Cohen-Or, Ron Kimmel, Matthias Zwicker
Improving Sequential Determinantal Point Processes for Supervised Video Summarization	It is now much easier than ever before to produce videos. While the ubiquitous video data is a great source for information discovery and extraction, the computational challenges are unparalleled. Automatically summarizing the videos has become a substantial need for browsing, searching, and indexing visual content. This paper is in the vein of supervised video summarization using sequential determinantal point processes (SeqDPPs), which models diversity by a probabilistic distribution. We improve this model in two folds. In terms of learning, we propose a large-margin algorithm to address the exposure bias problem in SeqDPP. In terms of modeling, we design a new probabilistic distribution such that, when it is integrated into SeqDPP, the resulting model accepts user input about the expected length of the summary. Moreover, we also significantly extend a popular video summarization dataset by 1) more egocentric videos, 2) dense user annotations, and 3) a refined evaluation scheme. We conduct extensive experiments on this dataset (about 60 hours of videos in total) and compare our approach to several competitive baselines.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Aidean_Sharghi_Improving_Sequential_Determinantal_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Aidean Sharghi , Ali Borji, Chengtao Li , Tianbao Yang , Boqing Gong
Graph Adaptive Knowledge Transfer for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation	Unsupervised domain adaptation has caught appealing attentions as it facilitates the unlabeled target learning by borrowing existing well-established source domain knowledge. Recent practice on domain adaptation manages to extract effective features by incorporating the pseudo labels for the target domain to better solve cross-domain distribution divergences. However, existing approaches separate target label optimization and domain-invariant feature learning as different steps. To address that issue, we develop a novel Graph Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (GAKT) model to jointly optimize target labels and domain-free features in a unified framework. Specifically, semi-supervised knowledge adaptation and label propagation on target data are coupled to benefit each other, and hence the marginal and conditional disparities across different domains will be better alleviated. Experimental evaluation on two cross-domain visual datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our designed approach on facilitating the unlabeled target task learning, compared to the state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhengming_Ding_Graph_Adaptive_Knowledge_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhengming Ding, Sheng Li, Ming Shao, Yun Fu
Multi-Scale Spatially-Asymmetric Recalibration for Image Classification	Convolution is spatially-symmetric, i.e., the visual features are independent of its position in the image, which limits its ability to use spatial information. This paper addresses this issue by a recalibration process, which refers to the surrounding region of each neuron, computes an importance value and multiplies it to the original neural response. Our approach is named multi-scale spatially-asymmetric recalibration (MS-SAR), which, besides introducing spatial asymmetry into convolution, extracts visual cues from regions at multiple scales to allow richer information to be incorporated. MS-SAR is implemented in an efficient way, so that only small fractions of extra parameters and computations are required. We apply MS-SAR to several popular network architectures, in which all convolutional layers are recalibrated, and demonstrate superior performance in both CIFAR and ILSVRC2012 classification tasks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yan_Wang_Spatial_Pyramid_Calibration_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yan Wang, Lingxi Xie, Siyuan Qiao, Ya Zhang, Wenjun Zhang, Alan L.

Materials for Masses: SVBRDF Acquisition with a Single Mobile Phone Image	We propose a material acquisition system that can recover the spatially-varying BRDF and normal map of a near-planar surface from a single image captured by a handheld mobile phone camera. Our technique images the surface under arbitrary environment lighting with the flash turned on, thereby avoiding shadows while simultaneously capturing high-frequency specular highlights. We train a CNN to regress an SVBRDF and surface normals from this image. Our network is trained using a large-scale SVBRDF dataset and designed to incorporate physical insights for material estimation, including an in-network rendering layer to model appearance and a material classification task to provide additional supervision during training. Finally, we refine the results from the network using a dense CRF module whose terms are designed specifically for our task. We demonstrate that our CNN-based SVBRDF inference leads to state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of materials on both synthetic and real data. We also provide extensive ablation studies to evaluate our network and demonstrate large improvements in comparisons with prior works.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhengqin_Li_Materials_for_Masses_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhengqin Li, Kalyan Sunkavalli, Manmohan Chandraker
Learning Single-View 3D Reconstruction with Limited Pose Supervision	It is expensive to label images with 3D structure or precise camera pose. Yet, this is precisely the kind of annotation required to train single-view 3D reconstruction models. In contrast, unlabeled images or images with just category labels are easy to acquire, but few current models can use this weak supervision. We present a unified framework that can combine both types of supervision: a small amount of camera pose annotations are used to enforce pose-invariance and view-point consistency, and unlabeled images combined with an adversarial loss are used to enforce the realism of rendered, generated models. We use this unified framework to measure the impact of each form of supervision in three paradigms: semi-supervised, multi-task, and transfer learning. We show that with a combination of these ideas, we can train single-view reconstruction models that improve up to 7 points in performance (AP) when using only 1% pose annotated training data.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Guandao_Yang_A_Unified_Framework_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Guandao Yang, Yin Cui, Serge Belongie, Bharath Hariharan
Semi-Supervised Generative Adversarial Hashing for Image Retrieval	With explosive growth of image and video data on the Internet, hashing technique has been extensively studied for large-scale visual search. Benefiting from the advance of deep learning, deep hashing methods have achieved promising performance. However, those deep hashing models are usually trained with supervised information, which is rare and expensive in practice, especially class labels. In this paper, inspired by the idea of generative models and the minimax two-player game, we propose a novel semi-supervised generative adversarial hashing (SSGAH) approach. Firstly, we unify a generative model, a discriminative model and a deep hashing model in a framework for making use of triplet-wise information and unlabeled data. Secondly, we design novel structure of the generative model and the discriminative model to learn the distribution of triplet-wise information in a semi-supervised way. In addition, we propose a semi-supervised ranking loss and an adversary ranking loss to learn binary codes which preserve semantic similarity for both labeled data and unlabeled data. Finally, by optimizing the whole model in an adversary training way, the learned binary codes can capture better semantic information of all data. Extensive empirical evaluations on two widely-used benchmark datasets show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Guanan_Wang_Semi-Supervised_Generative_Adversarial_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Guan'an Wang, Qinghao Hu, Jian Cheng, Zengguang Hou
Image Super-Resolution Using Very Deep Residual Channel Attention Networks	Convolutional neural network (CNN) depth is of crucial importance for image super-resolution (SR). However, we observe that deeper networks for image SR are more difficult to train. The low-resolution (LR) inputs and features contain abundant low-frequency information, which is treated equally across channels, hence hindering the representational ability of CNNs. To solve these problems, we propose the very deep residual channel attention networks (RCAN). Specifically, we propose residual in residual (RIR) structure to form very deep network, which consists of several residual groups with long skip connections. Each residual group contains some residual blocks with short skip connections. Meanwhile, RIR allows abundant low-frequency information to be bypassed through multiple skip connections, making the main network focus on learning high-frequency information. Furthermore, we propose channel attention mechanism to adaptively rescale channel-wise features by considering interdependencies among channels. Extensive experiments show that our RCAN achieves better accuracy and visual improvements against state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yulun_Zhang_Image_Super-Resolution_Using_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yulun Zhang, Kunpeng Li, Kai Li, Lichen Wang, Bineng Zhong, Yun Fu
Analyzing Clothing Layer Deformation Statistics of 3D Human Motions	Recent capture technologies and methods allow not only to retrieve 3D model sequence of moving people in clothing, but also to separate and extract the underlying body geometry, motion component and the clothing as a geometric layer. So far this clothing layer has only been used as raw offsets for individual applications such as retargeting a different body capture sequence with the clothing layer of another sequence, with limited scope, e.g. using identical or similar motions. The structured, semantics and motion-correlated nature of the information contained in this layer has yet to be fully understood and exploited. To this purpose we propose a comprehensive analysis of the statistics of this layer with a simple two-component model, based on PCA subspace reduction of the layer information on one hand, and a generic parameter regression model using neural networks on the other hand, designed to regress from any semantic parameter whose variation is observed in a training set, to the layer parameterization space. We show that this model not only allows to reproduce previous retargeting works, but generalizes the data generation capabilities to other semantic parameters such as clothing variation and size, or physical material parameters with synthetically generated training sequence, paving the way for many kinds of capture data-driven creation and augmentation applications.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jinlong_YANG_Analyzing_Clothing_Layer_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jinlong Yang, Jean-Sebastien Franco, Franck Hetroy-Wheeler, Stefanie Wuhrer
Monocular Depth Estimation Using Whole Strip Masking and Reliability-Based Refinement	We propose a monocular depth estimation algorithm, which extracts a depth map from a single image, based on whole strip masking (WSM) and reliability-based refinement. First, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) tailored for the depth estimation. Specifically, we design a novel filter, called WSM, to exploit the tendency that a scene has similar depths in horizonal or vertical directions. The proposed CNN combines WSM upsampling blocks with the ResNet encoder. Second, we measure the reliability of an estimated depth, by appending additional layers to the main CNN. Using the reliability information, we perform conditional random field (CRF) optimization to refine the estimated depth map. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides the state-of-the-art depth estimation performance, outperforming conventional algorithms significantly.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Minhyeok_Heo_Monocular_Depth_Estimation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Minhyeok Heo, Jaehan Lee, Kyung-Rae Kim, Han-Ul Kim, Chang-Su Kim
Joint Camera Spectral Sensitivity Selection and Hyperspectral Image Recovery	Hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery from a single RGB image has attracted much attention, whose performance has recently been shown to be sensitive to the camera spectral sensitivity (CSS). In this paper, we present an efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) based method, which can jointly select the optimal CSS from a candidate dataset and learn a mapping to recover HSI from a single RGB image captured with this algorithmically selected camera. Given a specific CSS, we first present a HSI recovery network, which accounts for the underlying characteristics of the HSI, including spectral nonlinear mapping and spatial similarity. Later, we append a CSS selection layer onto the recovery network, and the optimal CSS can thus be automatically determined from the network weights under the nonnegative sparse constraint. Experimental results show that our HSI recovery network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and perceptive quality, and the selection layer always returns a CSS consistent to the best one determined by exhaustive search.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ying_Fu_Joint_Camera_Spectral_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ying Fu, Tao Zhang, Yinqiang Zheng, Debing Zhang, Hua Huang
Distortion-Aware Convolutional Filters for Dense Prediction in Panoramic Images	There is a high demand of 3D data for 360° panoramic images and videos, pushed by the growing availability on the market of specialized hardware for both capturing (e.g., omnidirectional cameras) as well as visualizing in 3D (e.g., head mounted displays) panoramic images and videos. At the same time, 3D sensors able to capture 3D panoramic data are expensive and/or hardly available. To fill this gap, we propose a learning approach for panoramic depth map estimation from a single image. Thanks to a specifically developed distortion-aware deformable convolution filter, our method can be trained by means of conventional perspective images, then used to regress depth for panoramic images, thus bypassing the effort needed to create annotated panoramic training dataset. We also demonstrate our approach for emerging tasks such as panoramic monocular SLAM, panoramic semantic segmentation and panoramic style transfer.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Keisuke_Tateno_Distortion-Aware_Convolutional_Filters_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Keisuke Tateno, Nassir Navab, Federico Tombari
Attribute-Guided Face Generation Using Conditional CycleGAN	We are interested in attribute-guided face generation: given a low-res face input image, an attribute vector that can be extracted from a high-res image (attribute image), our new method generates a high-res face image for the low-res input that satisfies the given attributes. To address this problem, we condition the CycleGAN and propose conditional CycleGAN, which is designed to 1) handle unpaired training data because the training low/high-res and high-res attribute images may not necessarily align with each other, and to 2) allow easy control of the appearance of the generated face via the input attributes. We demonstrate impressive results on the attribute-guided conditional CycleGAN, which can synthesize realistic face images with appearance easily controlled by user-supplied attributes (e.g., gender, makeup, hair color, eyeglasses). Using the attribute image as identity to produce the corresponding conditional vector and by incorporating a face verification network, the attribute-guided network becomes the identity-guided conditional CycleGAN which produces impressive and interesting results on identity transfer. We demonstrate three applications on identity-guided conditional CycleGAN: identity-preserving face superresolution, face swapping, and frontal face generation, which consistently show the advantage of our new method.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yongyi_Lu_Attribute-Guided_Face_Generation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yongyi Lu, Yu-Wing Tai, Chi-Keung Tang
Integrating Egocentric Videos in Top-view Surveillance Videos: Joint Identification and Temporal Alignment	Videos recorded from first person (egocentric) perspective have little visual appearance in common with those from third person perspective, especially with videos captured by top-view surveillance cameras. In this paper, we aim to relate these two sources of information from a surveillance standpoint, namely in terms of identification and temporal alignment. Given an egocentric video and a top-view video, our goals are to: a) identify the egocentric camera holder in the top-view video (self-identification), b) identify the humans visible in the content of the egocentric video, within the content of the top-view video (re-identification), and c) temporally align the two videos. The main challenge is that each of these tasks is highly dependent on the other two. We propose a unified framework to jointly solve all three problems. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach on a publicly available dataset containing a variety of videos recorded in different scenarios.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Shervin_Ardeshir_Integrating_Egocentric_Videos_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Shervin Ardeshir, Ali Borji
Unsupervised Learning of Multi-Frame Optical Flow with Occlusions	Learning optical flow with neural networks is hampered by the need for obtaining training data with associated ground truth. Unsupervised learning is a promising direction, yet the performance of current unsupervised methods is still limited. In particular, the lack of proper occlusion handling in commonly used data terms constitutes a major source of error. While most optical flow methods process pairs of consecutive frames, more advanced occlusion reasoning can be realized when considering multiple frames. In this paper, we propose a framework for unsupervised learning of optical flow and occlusions over multiple frames. More specifically, we exploit the minimal configuration of three frames to strengthen the photometric loss and explicitly reason about occlusions. We demonstrate that our multi-frame, occlusion-sensitive formulation outperforms existing unsupervised two-frame methods and even produces results on par with some fully supervised methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Joel_Janai_Unsupervised_Learning_of_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Joel Janai, Fatma Guney, Anurag Ranjan, Michael Black, Andreas Geiger
HandMap: Robust Hand Pose Estimation via Intermediate Dense Guidance Map Supervision	This work presents a novel hand pose estimation framework via intermediate dense guidance map supervision. By leveraging the advantage of predicting heat maps of hand joints in detection-based methods, we propose to use dense feature maps through intermediate supervision in a regression-based framework that is not limited to the resolution of the heat map. Our dense feature maps are delicately designed to encode the hand geometry and the spatial relation between local joint and global hand. The proposed framework significantly improves the state-of-the-art in both 2D and 3D on the recent benchmark datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiaokun_Wu_HandMap_Robust_Hand_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiaokun Wu, Daniel Finnegan, Eamonn O'Neill, Yong-Liang Yang
Revisiting RCNN: On Awakening the Classification Power of Faster RCNN	Recent region-based object detectors are usually built with separate classification and localization branches on top of shared feature extraction networks. In this paper, we analyze failure cases of state-of-the-art detectors and observe that most hard false positives result from classification instead of localization. We conjecture that: (1) Shared feature representation is not optimal due to the mismatched goals of feature learning for classification and localization; (2) multi-task learning helps, yet optimization of the multi-task loss may result in sub-optimal for individual tasks; (3) large receptive field for different scales leads to redundant context information for small objects. We demonstrate the potential of detector classification power by a simple, effective, and widely-applicable Decoupled Classification Refinement (DCR) network. DCR samples hard false positives from the base classifier in Faster RCNN and trains a RCNN-styled strong classifier. Experiments show new state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC and COCO without any bells and whistles.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Bowen_Cheng_Revisiting_RCNN_On_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Bowen Cheng, Yunchao Wei, Honghui Shi, Rogerio Feris, Jinjun Xiong, Thomas Huang
Exploring the Limits of Weakly Supervised Pretraining	"State-of-the-art visual perception models for a wide range of tasks rely on supervised pretraining. ImageNet classification is the de facto pretraining task for these models. Yet, ImageNet is now nearly ten years old and is by modern standards ""small"". Even so, relatively little is known about the behavior of pretraining with datasets that are multiple orders of magnitude larger. The reasons are obvious: such datasets are difficult to collect and annotate. In this paper, we present a unique study of transfer learning with large convolutional networks trained to predict hashtags on billions of social media images. Our experiments demonstrate that training for large-scale hashtag prediction leads to excellent results. We show improvements on several image classification and object detection tasks, and report the highest ImageNet-1k single-crop, top-1 accuracy to date: 85.4% (97.6% top-5). We also perform extensive experiments that provide novel empirical data on the relationship between large-scale pretraining and transfer learning performance."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Dhruv_Mahajan_Exploring_the_Limits_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Dhruv Mahajan, Ross Girshick, Vignesh Ramanathan, Kaiming He, Manohar Paluri, Yixuan Li, Ashwin Bharambe, Laurens van der Maaten
Online Detection of Action Start in Untrimmed, Streaming Videos	We aim to tackle a novel task in action detection - Online Detection of Action Start (ODAS) in untrimmed, streaming videos. The goal of ODAS is to detect the start of an action instance, with high categorization accuracy and low detection latency. ODAS is important in many applications such as early alert generation to allow timely security or emergency response. We propose three novel methods to specifically address the challenges in training ODAS models: (1) hard negative samples generation based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to distinguish ambiguous background, (2) explicitly modeling the temporal consistency between data around action start and data succeeding action start, and (3) adaptive sampling strategy to handle the scarcity of training data. We conduct extensive experiments using THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet. We show that our proposed methods lead to significant performance gains and improve the state-of-the-art methods.

ForestHash: Semantic Hashing With Shallow Random Forests and Tiny Convolutional Networks	In this paper, we introduce a random forest semantic hashing scheme that embeds tiny convolutional neural networks (CNN) into shallow random forests. A binary hash code for a data point is obtained by a set of decision trees, setting `1' for the visited tree leaf, and `0' for the rest. We propose to first randomly group arriving classes at each tree split node into two groups, obtaining a significantly simplified two-class classification problem that can be a handled with a light-weight CNN weak learner. Code uniqueness is achieved via the random class grouping, whilst code consistency is achieved using a low-rank loss in the CNN weak learners that encourages intra-class compactness for the two random class groups. Finally, we introduce an information-theoretic approach for aggregating codes of individual trees into a single hash code, producing a near-optimal unique hash for each class. The proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods for image retrieval tasks on large-scale public datasets, and is comparable to image classification methods while utilizing a more compact, efficient and scalable representation. This work proposes a principled and robust procedure to train and deploy in parallel an ensemble of light-weight CNNs, instead of simply going deeper.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Qiang_Qiu_ForestHash_Semantic_Hashing_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Qiang Qiu, Jose Lezama, Alex Bronstein, Guillermo Sapiro
Learning 3D Human Pose from Structure and Motion	3D human pose estimation from a single image is a challenging problem, especially for in-the-wild settings due to the lack of 3D annotated data. We propose two anatomically inspired loss functions and use them with a weakly-supervised learning framework to jointly learn from large-scale in-the-wild 2D and indoor/synthetic 3D data. We also present a simple temporal network that exploits temporal and structural cues present in predicted pose sequences to temporally harmonize the pose estimations. We carefully analyze the proposed contributions through loss surface visualizations and sensitivity analysis to facilitate deeper understanding of their working mechanism. Jointly, the two networks capture the anatomical constraints in static and kinetic states of the human body. Our complete pipeline improves the state-of-the-art by 11.8% and 12% on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, respectively, and runs at 30 FPS on a commodity graphics card.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Rishabh_Dabral_Learning_3D_Human_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Rishabh Dabral, Anurag Mundhada, Uday Kusupati, Safeer Afaque, Abhishek Sharma, Arjun Jain
Attentive Semantic Alignment with Offset-Aware Correlation Kernels	Semantic correspondence is the problem of establishing correspondences across images depicting different instances of the same object or scene class. One of recent approaches to this problem is to estimate parameters of a global transformation model that densely aligns one image to the other. Since an entire correlation map between all feature pairs across images is typically used to predict such a global transformation, noisy features from different backgrounds, clutter, and occlusion distract the predictor from correct estimation of the alignment. This is a challenging issue, in particular, in the problem of semantic correspondence where a large degree of image variations is often involved. In this paper, we introduce an attentive semantic alignment method that focuses on reliable correlations, filtering out distractors. For effective attention, we also propose an offset-aware correlation kernel that learns to capture translation-invariant local transformations in computing correlation values over spatial locations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the attentive model and offset-aware kernel, and the proposed model combining both techniques achieves the state-of-the-art performance.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Paul_Hongsuck_Seo_Attentive_Semantic_Alignment_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Paul Hongsuck Seo, Jongmin Lee, Deunsol Jung, Bohyung Han, Minsu Cho
Localization Recall Precision (LRP): A New Performance Metric for Object Detection	"Average precision (AP), the area under the recall-precision (RP) curve, is the standard performance measure for object detection. Despite its wide acceptance, it has a number of shortcomings, the most important of which are (i) the inability to distinguish very different RP curves, and (ii) the lack of directly measuring bounding box localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose ""Localization Recall Precision (LRP) Error"", a new metric specifically designed for object detection. LRP Error is composed of three components related to localization, false negative (FN) rate and false positive (FP) rate. Based on LRP, we introduce the ""Optimal LRP"" (oLRP), the minimum achievable LRP error representing the best achievable configuration of the detector in terms of recall-precision and the tightness of the boxes. In contrast to AP, which considers precisions over the entire recall domain, oLRP determines the ""best"" confidence score threshold for a class, which balances the trade-off between localization and recall-precision. In our experiments, we show that oLRP provides richer and more discriminative information than AP. We also demonstrate that the best confidence score thresholds vary significantly among classes and detectors. Moreover, we present LRP results of a simple online video object detector and show that the class-specific optimized thresholds increase the accuracy against the common approach of using a general threshold for all classes. Our experiments demonstrate that LRP is more competent than AP in capturing the performance of detectors.

Unsupervised CNN-based Co-Saliency Detection with Graphical Optimization	In this paper, we address co-saliency detection in a set of images jointly covering objects of a specific class by an unsupervised convolutional neural network (CNN). Our method does not require any additional training data in the form of object masks. We decompose co-saliency detection into two sub-tasks, single-image saliency detection and cross-image co-occurrence region discovery corresponding to two novel unsupervised losses, the single-image saliency (SIS) loss and the co-occurrence (COOC) loss. The two losses are modeled on a graphical model where the former and the latter act as the unary and pairwise terms, respectively. These two tasks can be jointly optimized for generating co-saliency maps of high quality. Furthermore, the quality of the generated co-saliency maps can be enhanced via two extensions: map sharpening by self-paced learning and boundary preserving by fully connected conditional random fields. Experiments show that our method achieves superior results, even outperforming many supervised methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Kuang-Jui_Hsu_Unsupervised_CNN-based_co-saliency_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Kuang-Jui Hsu, Chung-Chi Tsai, Yen-Yu Lin, Xiaoning Qian, Yung-Yu Chuang
Exploiting temporal information for 3D human pose estimation	In this work, we address the problem of 3D human pose estimation from a sequence of 2D human poses. Although the recent success of deep networks has led many state-of-the-art methods for 3D pose estimation to train deep networks end-to-end to predict from images directly, the top-performing approaches have shown the effectiveness of dividing the task of 3D pose estimation into two steps: using a state-of-the-art 2D pose estimator to estimate the 2D pose from images and then mapping them into 3D space. They also showed that a low-dimensional representation like 2D locations of a set of joints can be discriminative enough to estimate 3D pose with high accuracy. However, estimation of 3D pose for individual frames leads to temporally incoherent estimates due to independent error in each frame causing jitter. Therefore, in this work we utilize the temporal information across a sequence of 2D joint locations to estimate a sequence of 3D poses. We designed a sequence-to-sequence network composed of layer-normalized LSTM units with shortcut connections connecting the input to the output on the decoder side and imposed temporal smoothness constraint during training. We found that the knowledge of temporal consistency improves the best reported result on Human3.6M dataset by approximately $12.2%$ and helps our network to recover temporally consistent 3D poses over a sequence of images even when the 2D pose detector fails.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Mir_Rayat_Imtiaz_Hossain_Exploiting_temporal_information_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Mir Rayat Imtiaz Hossain, James J.

Liquid Pouring Monitoring via Rich Sensory Inputs	Humans have the amazing ability to perform very subtle manipulation task using a closed-loop control system with imprecise mechanics (i.e., our body parts) but rich sensory information (e.g., vision, tactile, etc.). In the closed-loop system, the ability to monitor the state of the task via rich sensory information is important but often less studied. In this work, we take liquid pouring as a concrete example and aim at learning to continuously monitor whether liquid pouring is successful (e.g., no spilling) or not via rich sensory inputs. We mimic humans' rich sensories using synchronized observation from a chest-mounted camera and a wrist-mounted IMU sensor. Given many success and failure demonstrations of liquid pouring, we train a hierarchical LSTM with late fusion for monitoring. To improve the robustness of the system, we propose two auxiliary tasks during training: inferring (1) the initial state of containers and (2) forecasting the one-step future 3D trajectory of the hand with an adversarial training procedure. These tasks encourage our method to learn representation sensitive to container states and how objects are manipulated in 3D. With these novel components, our method achieves ~8% and ~11% better monitoring accuracy than the baseline method without auxiliary tasks on unseen containers and unseen users respectively.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tz-Ying_Wu_Liquid_Pouring_Monitoring_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tz-Ying Wu, Juan-Ting Lin, Tsun-Hsuang Wang, Chan-Wei Hu, Juan Carlos Niebles, Min Sun
Flow-Grounded Spatial-Temporal Video Prediction from Still Images	Existing video prediction methods mainly rely on observing multiple historical frames or focus on predicting the next one-frame. In this work, we study the problem of generating consecutive multiple future frames by observing one single still image only. We formulate the multi-frame prediction task as a multiple time step flow (multi-flow) prediction phase followed by a flow-to-frame synthesis phase. The multi-flow prediction is modeled in a variational probabilistic manner with spatial-temporal relationships learned through 3D convolutions. The flow-to-frame synthesis is modeled as a generative process in order to keep the predicted results lying closer to the manifold shape of real video sequence. Such a two-phase design prevents the model from directly looking at the high-dimensional pixel space of the frame sequence and is demonstrated to be more effective in predicting better and diverse results. Extensive experimental results on videos with different types of motion show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against existing methods in terms of quality, diversity and human perceptual evaluation.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yijun_Li_Flow-Grounded_Spatial-Temporal_Video_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yijun Li, Chen Fang, Jimei Yang, Zhaowen Wang, Xin Lu, Ming-Hsuan Yang
Person Search by Multi-Scale Matching	We consider the problem of person search in unconstrained scene images. Existing methods usually focus on improving the person detection accuracy to mitigate negative effects imposed by misalignment, mis-detections, and false alarms resulted from noisy people auto-detection. In contrast to previous studies, we show that sufficiently reliable person instance cropping is achievable by slightly improved state-of-the-art deep learning object detectors (e.g. Faster-RCNN), and the under-studied multi-scale matching problem in person search is a more severe barrier. In this work, we address this multi-scale person search challenge by proposing a Cross-Level Semantic Alignment (CLSA) deep learning approach capable of learning more discriminative identity feature representations in a unified end-to-end model. This is realised by exploiting the in-network feature pyramid structure of a deep neural network enhanced by a novel cross pyramid-level semantic alignment loss function. This favourably eliminates the need for constructing a computationally expensive image pyramid and a complex multi-branch network architecture. Extensive experiments show the modelling advantages and performance superiority of CLSA over the state-of-the-art person search and multi-scale matching methods on two large person search benchmarking datasets: CUHK-SYSU and PRW.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xu_Lan_Person_Search_by_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xu Lan , Xiatian Zhu , Shaogang Gong
Predicting Future Instance Segmentation by Forecasting Convolutional Features	"Anticipating future events is an important prerequisite towards intelligent behavior. Video forecasting has been studied as a proxy task towards this goal. Recent work has shown that to predict semantic segmentation of future frames, forecasting at the semantic level is more effective than forecasting RGB frames and then segmenting these. In this paper we consider the more challenging problem of future instance segmentation, which additionally segments out individual objects. To deal with a varying number of output labels per image, we develop a predictive model in the space of fixed-sized convolutional features of the Mask R-CNN instance segmentation model. We apply the ""detection head"" of Mask R-CNN on the predicted features to produce the instance segmentation of future frames. Experiments show that this approach significantly improves over strong baselines based on optical flow and repurposed instance segmentation architectures."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Pauline_Luc_Predicting_Future_Instance_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Pauline Luc, Camille Couprie, Yann LeCun, Jakob Verbeek
U-PC: Unsupervised Planogram Compliance	We present an end-to-end solution for recognizing merchandise displayed in the shelves of a supermarket. Given images of individual products, which are taken under ideal illumination for product marketing, the challenge is to find these products automatically in the images of the shelves. Note that the images of shelves are taken using hand-held camera under store level illumination. We provide a two-layer hypotheses generation and verification model. In the first layer, the model predicts a set of candidate merchandise at a specific location of the shelf while in the second layer, the hypothesis is verified by a novel graph theoretic approach. The performance of the proposed approach on two publicly available datasets is better than the competing approaches by at least 10%.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Archan_Ray_U-PC_Unsupervised_Planogram_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Archan Ray, Nishant Kumar, Avishek Shaw, Dipti Prasad Mukherjee
Model-free Consensus Maximization for Non-Rigid Shapes	Many computer vision methods use consensus maximization to re- late measurements containing outliers with the correct transformation model. In the context of rigid shapes, this is typically done using Random Sampling and Consensus (RANSAC) by estimating an analytical model that agrees with the largest number of measurements (inliers). However, small parameter models may not be always available. In this paper, we formulate the model-free consensus maximization as an Integer Program in a graph using 'rules' on measurements. We then provide a method to solve it optimally using the Branch and Bound (BnB) paradigm. We focus its application on non-rigid shapes, where we apply the method to remove outlier 3D correspondences and achieve performance supe- rior to the state of the art. Our method works with outlier ratio as high as 80%. We further derive a similar formulation for 3D template to image matching, achieving similar or better performance compared to the state of the art.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Thomas_Probst_Model-free_Consensus_Maximization_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Thomas Probst, Ajad Chhatkuli, Danda Pani Paudel, Luc Van Gool
Efficient Relative Attribute Learning using Graph Neural Networks	A sizable body of work on relative attributes provides compelling evidence that relating pairs of images along a continuum of strength pertaining to a visual attribute yields significant improvements in a wide variety of tasks in vision. In this paper, we show how emerging ideas in graph neural networks can yield a unified solution to various problems that broadly fall under relative attribute learning. Our main idea is the realization that relative attribute learning naturally benefits from exploiting the graphical structure of dependencies among the different relative attributes of images, especially when only partial ordering of the relative attributes is provided in the training data. We use message passing on a probabilistic graphical model to perform end to end learning of appropriate representations of the images, their relationships as well as the interplay between different attributes to best align with provided annotations. Our experiments demonstrate that this simple end-to-end learning framework using GNNs is very effective in achieving competitive accuracy with specialized methods for both relative attribute learning and binary attribute prediction, while significantly relaxing the requirements on the training data and/or the number of parameters or both.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zihang_Meng_Efficient_Relative_Attribute_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zihang Meng, Nagesh Adluru, Hyunwoo J.

Linear Span Network for Object Skeleton Detection	Robust object skeleton detection requires to explore rich representative visual features and effective feature fusion strategies. In this paper, we first re-visit the implementation of HED, the essential principle of which can be ideally described with a linear reconstruction model. Hinted by this, we formalize a Linear Span framework, and propose Linear Span Network (LSN) modified by Linear Span Units (LSUs), which minimize the reconstruction error of convolutional network. LSN further utilizes subspace linear span beside the feature linear span to increase the independence of convolutional features and the efficiency of feature integration, which enlarges the capability of fitting complex ground-truth. As a result, LSN can effectively suppress the cluttered backgrounds and reconstruct object skeletons. Experimental results validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed LSN.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chang_Liu_Linear_Span_Network_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chang Liu, Wei Ke, Fei Qin, Qixiang Ye
TextSnake: A Flexible Representation for Detecting Text of Arbitrary Shapes	Driven by deep neural networks and large scale datasets, scene text detection methods have progressed substantially over the past years, continuously refreshing the performance records on various standard benchmarks. However, limited by the representations (axis-aligned rectangles, rotated rectangles or quadrangles) adopted to describe text, existing methods may fall short when dealing with much more free-form text instances, such as curved text, which are actually very common in real-world scenarios. To tackle this problem, we propose a more flexible representation for scene text, termed as extit{TextSnake}, which is able to effectively represent text instances in horizontal, oriented and curved forms. In TextSnake, a text instance is described as a sequence of ordered, overlapping disks centered at symmetric axes, each of which is associated with potentially variable radius and orientation. Such geometry attributes are estimated via a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) model. In experiments, the text detector based on TextSnake achieves state-of-the-art performance on Total-Text and SCUT-CTW1500, the two newly published benchmarks with special emphasis on curved text in natural images, as well as the widely-used datasets ICDAR 2015 and MSRA-TD500. Specifically, TextSnake outperforms the baseline on Total-Text by more than extit{$40%$} in F-measure.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Shangbang_Long_TextSnake_A_Flexible_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Shangbang Long, Jiaqiang Ruan, Wenjie Zhang, Xin He, Wenhao Wu, Cong Yao
Reverse Attention for Salient Object Detection	Benefit from the quick development of deep learning techniques, salient object detection has achieved remarkable progresses recently. However, there still exists following two major challenges that hinder its application in embedded devices, low resolution output and heavy model weight. To this end, this paper presents an accurate yet compact deep network for efficient salient object detection. More specifically, given a coarse saliency prediction in the deepest layer, we first employ residual learning to learn side-output residual features for saliency refinement, which can be achieved with very limited convolutional parameters while keep accuracy. Secondly, we further propose reverse attention to guide such side-output residual learning in a top-down manner. By erasing the current predicted salient regions from side-output features, the network can eventually explore the missing object parts and details which results in high resolution and accuracy. Experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach compares favorably against state-of-the-art methods, and with advantages in terms of simplicity, efficiency (45 FPS) and model size (81 MB).	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Shuhan_Chen_Reverse_Attention_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Shuhan Chen, Xiuli Tan, Ben Wang, Xuelong Hu
Start, Follow, Read: End-to-End Full-Page Handwriting Recognition	Despite decades of research, offline handwriting recognition (HWR) of degraded historical documents remains a challenging problem, which if solved could greatly improve the searchability of online cultural heritage archives. HWR models are often limited by the accuracy of the preceding steps of text detection and segmentation. Motivated by this, we present a deep learning model that jointly learns text detection, segmentation, and recognition using mostly images without detection or segmentation annotations. Our Start, Follow, Read (SFR) model is composed of a Region Proposal Network to find the start position of text lines, a novel line follower network that incrementally follows and preprocesses lines of (perhaps curved) text into dewarped images suitable for recognition by a CNN-LSTM network. SFR exceeds the performance of the winner of the ICDAR2017 handwriting recognition competition, even when not using the provided competition region annotations.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Curtis_Wigington_Start_Follow_Read_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Curtis Wigington, Chris Tensmeyer, Brian Davis, William Barrett, Brian Price, Scott Cohen
Joint Map and Symmetry Synchronization	Most existing techniques in map computation (e.g., in the form of feature or dense correspondences) assume that the underlying map between an object pair is unique. This assumption, however, easily breaks when visual objects possess self-symmetries. In this paper, we study the problem of jointly optimizing self-symmetries and pair-wise maps among a collection of similar objects. We introduce a lifting map representation for encoding both symmetry groups and maps between symmetry groups. Based on this representation, we introduce a reweighted non-linear least square framework for joint symmetry and map synchronization. Experimental results show that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for self-symmetry group extraction from a single object as well as joint map optimization among a object collection.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Qixing_Huang_Joint_Map_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yifan Sun, Zhenxiao Liang, Xiangru Huang, Qixing Huang
Learning Priors for Semantic 3D Reconstruction	We present a novel semantic 3D reconstruction framework which embeds variational regularization into a neural network. Our network performs a fixed number of unrolled multi-scale optimization iterations with shared interaction weights. In contrast to existing variational methods for semantic 3D reconstruction, our model is end-to-end trainable and captures more complex dependencies between the semantic labels and the 3D geometry. Compared to previous learning-based approaches to 3D reconstruction, we integrate powerful long-range dependencies using variational coarse-to-fine optimization. As a result, our network architecture requires only a moderate number of parameters while keeping a high level of expressiveness which enables learning from very little data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our network achieves higher accuracy compared to a purely variational approach while at the same time requiring two orders of magnitude less iterations to converge. Moreover, our approach handles ten times more semantic class labels using the same computational resources.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ian_Cherabier_Learning_Priors_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ian Cherabier, Johannes L.

Quaternion Convolutional Neural Networks	Neural networks in the real domain have been studied for a long time and achieved promising results in many vision tasks for recent years. However, the extensions of the neural network models in other number fields and their potential applications are not fully-investigated yet. Focusing on color images, which can be naturally represented as quaternion matrices, we propose a quaternion convolutional neural network (QCNN) model to obtain more representative features. In particular, we re-design the basic modules like convolution layer and fully-connected layer in the quaternion domain, which can be used to establish fully-quaternion convolutional neural networks. Moreover, these modules are compatible with almost all deep learning techniques and can be plugged into traditional CNNs easily. We test our QCNN models in both color image classification and denoising tasks. Experimental results show that they outperform the real-valued CNNs with same structures.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xuanyu_Zhu_Quaternion_Convolutional_Neural_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xuanyu Zhu, Yi Xu, Hongteng Xu, Changjian Chen
Comparator Networks	The objective of this work is set-based verification, e.g. to decide if two sets of images of a face are of the same person or not. The traditional approach to this problem is to learn to generate a feature vector per image, aggregate them into one vector to represent the set, and then compute the cosine similarity between sets. Instead, we design a neural network architecture that can directly learn set-wise verification. Our contributions are: (i) We propose a Deep Comparator Network (DCN) that can ingest a pair of sets (each may contain a variable number of images) as inputs, and compute a similarity between the pair -- this involves attending to multiple discriminative local regions (landmarks), and comparing local descriptors between pairs of faces; (ii) To encourage high-quality representations for each set, internal competition is introduced for recalibration based on the landmark score; (iii) Inspired by image retrieval, a novel hard sample mining regime is proposed to control the sampling process, such that the DCN is complementary to the standard classification models. Evaluations on the IARPA Janus face recognition benchmarks show that the comparator networks outperform the previous state-of-the-art results by a large margin.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Weidi_Xie_Comparator_Networks_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Weidi Xie, Li Shen, Andrew Zisserman
Unsupervised Geometry-Aware Representation for 3D Human Pose Estimation	Modern 3D human pose estimation techniques rely on deep networks, which require large amounts of training data. While weakly-supervised methods require less supervision, by utilizing 2D poses or multi-view imagery without annotations, they still need a sufficiently large set of samples with 3D annotations for learning to succeed. In this paper, we propose to overcome this problem by learning a geometry-aware body representation from multi-view images without annotations. To this end, we use an encoder-decoder that predicts an image from one viewpoint given an image from another viewpoint. Because this representation encodes 3D geometry, using it in a semi-supervised setting makes it easier to learn a mapping from it to 3D human pose. As evidenced by our experiments, our approach significantly outperforms fully-supervised methods given the same amount of labeled data, and improves over other semi-supervised methods while using as little as 1% of the labeled data.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Helge_Rhodin_Unsupervised_Geometry-Aware_Representation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Helge Rhodin, Mathieu Salzmann, Pascal Fua
Face De-Spoofing: Anti-Spoofing via Noise Modeling	Many prior face anti-spoofing works develop discriminative models for recognizing the subtle differences between live and spoof faces. Those approaches often regard the image as an indivisible unit, and process it holistically, without explicit modeling of the spoofing process. In this work, motivated by the noise modeling and denoising algorithms, we identify a new problem of face de-spoofing, for the purpose of anti-spoofing: inversely decomposing a spoof face into a spoof noise and a live face, and then utilizing the spoof noise for classification. A CNN architecture with proper constraints and supervisions is proposed to overcome the problem of having no ground truth for the decomposition. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple face anti-spoofing databases. The results show promising improvements due to our spoof noise modeling. Moreover, the estimated spoof noise provides a visualization which helps to understand the added spoof noise by each spoof medium.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yaojie_Liu_Face_De-spoofing_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Amin Jourabloo, Yaojie Liu, Xiaoming Liu
Unpaired Image Captioning by Language Pivoting	Image captioning is a multimodal task involving computer vision and natural language processing, where the goal is to learn a mapping from the image to its natural language description. In general, the mapping function is learned from a training set of image-caption pairs. However, for some language, large scale image-caption paired corpus might not be available. We present an approach to this unpaired image captioning problem by language pivoting. Our method can effectively capture the characteristics of an image captioner from the pivot language (Chinese) and align it to the target language (English) using another pivot-target (Chinese-English) parallel corpus. We evaluate our method on two image-to-English benchmark datasets: MSCOCO and Flickr30K. Quantitative comparisons against several baseline approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jiuxiang_Gu_Unpaired_Image_Captioning_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jiuxiang Gu, Shafiq Joty, Jianfei Cai, Gang Wang
Hierarchical Bilinear Pooling for Fine-Grained Visual Recognition	Fine-grained visual recognition is challenging because it highly relies on the modeling of various semantic parts and fine-grained feature learning. Bilinear pooling based models have been shown to be effective at fine-grained recognition, while most previous approaches neglect the fact that inter-layer part feature interaction and fine-grained feature learning are mutually correlated and can reinforce each other. In this paper, we present a novel model to address these issues. First, a cross-layer bilinear pooling approach is proposed to capture the inter-layer part feature relations, which results in superior performance compared with other bilinear pooling approaches. Second, we propose a novel hierarchical bilinear pooling framework to integrate multiple cross-layer bilinear features to enhance their representation capability. Our formulation is intuitive, efficient and achieves state-of-the-art results on the widely used fine-grained recognition datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chaojian_Yu_Hierarchical_Bilinear_Pooling_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chaojian Yu, Xinyi Zhao, Qi Zheng, Peng Zhang, Xinge You
Fine-Grained Visual Categorization using Meta-Learning Optimization with Sample Selection of Auxiliary Data	Fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) is challenging due in part to the fact that it is often difficult to acquire an enough number of training samples. To employ large models for FGVC without suffering from overfitting, existing methods usually adopt a strategy of pre-training the models using a rich set of auxiliary data, followed by fine-tuning on the target FGVC task. However, the objective of pre-training does not take the target task into account, and consequently such obtained models are suboptimal for fine-tuning. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a new deep FGVC model termed MetaFGNet. Training of MetaFGNet is based on a novel regularized meta-learning objective, which aims to guide the learning of network parameters so that they are optimal for adapting to the target FGVC task. Based on MetaFGNet, we also propose a simple yet effective scheme for selecting more useful samples from the auxiliary data. Experiments on benchmark FGVC datasets show the efficacy of our proposed method.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yabin_Zhang_Fine-Grained_Visual_Categorization_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yabin Zhang, Hui Tang, Kui Jia
K-convexity shape priors for segmentation	"This work extends popular star-convexity and other more general forms of convexity priors. We represent an object as a union of ""convex'' overlappable subsets. Since an arbitrary shape can always be divided into convex parts, our regularization model restricts the number of such parts. Previous k-part shape priors are limited to disjoint parts. For example, one approach segments an object via optimizing its $k$-coverage by disjoint convex parts, which we show is highly sensitive to local minima. In contrast, our shape model allows the convex parts to overlap, which both relaxes and simplifies the coverage problem, e.g. fewer parts are needed to represent any object. As shown in the paper, for many forms of convexity our regularization model is significantly more descriptive for any given k. Our shape prior is useful in practice, e.g. in biomedical applications, and its optimization is robust to local minima."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hossam_Isack_K-convexity_shape_priors_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hossam Isack, Lena Gorelick, Karin Ng, Olga Veksler, Yuri Boykov
DF-Net: Unsupervised Joint Learning of Depth and Flow using Cross-Task Consistency	We present an unsupervised learning framework for simultaneously training single-view depth prediction and optical flow estimation models using unlabeled video sequences. Existing unsupervised methods often exploit brightness constancy and spatial smoothness priors to train depth or flow models. In this paper, we propose to leverage geometric consistency as additional supervisory signals. Our core idea is that for rigid regions we can use the predicted scene depth and camera motion to synthesize 2D optical flow by backprojecting the induced 3D scene flow. The discrepancy between the rigid flow (from depth prediction and camera motion) and the estimated flow (from optical flow model) allows us to impose a cross-task consistency loss. While all the networks are jointly optimized during training, they can be applied independently at test time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our depth and flow models compare favorably with state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yuliang_Zou_DF-Net_Unsupervised_Joint_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yuliang Zou, Zelun Luo, Jia-Bin Huang
Broadcasting Convolutional Network for Visual Relational Reasoning	In this paper, we propose the Broadcasting Convolutional Network (BCN) that extracts key object features from the global field of an entire input image and recognizes their relationship with local features. BCN is a simple network module that collects effective spatial features, embeds location information and broadcasts them to the entire feature maps. We further introduce the Multi-Relational Network (multiRN) that improves the existing Relation Network (RN) by utilizing the BCN module. In pixel-based relation reasoning problems, with the help of BCN, multiRN extends the concept of `pairwise relations' in conventional RNs to `multiwise relations' by relating each object with multiple objects at once. This yields in O(n) complexity for n objects, which is a vast computational gain from RNs that take O(n^2). Through experiments, multiRN has achieved a state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR dataset, which proves the usability of BCN on relation reasoning problems.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Simyung_Chang_Broadcasting_Convolutional_Network_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Simyung Chang, John Yang, SeongUk Park, Nojun Kwak
Cross-Modal Ranking with Soft Consistency and Noisy Labels for Robust RGB-T Tracking	Due to the complementary benefits of visible (RGB) and thermal infrared (T) data, RGB-T object tracking attracts more and more attention recently for boosting the performance under adverse illumination conditions. Existing RGB-T tracking methods usually localize a target object with a bounding box, in which the trackers or detectors is often affected by the inclusion of background clutter. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel approach to suppress background effects for RGB-T tracking. Our approach relies on a novel cross-modal manifold ranking algorithm. First, we integrate the soft cross-modality consistency into the ranking model which allows the sparse inconsistency to account for the different properties between these two modalities. Second, we propose an optimal query learning method to handle label noises of queries. In particular, we introduce an intermediate variable to represent the optimal labels, and formulate it as a $l_1$-optimization based sparse learning problem. Moreover, we propose a single unified optimization algorithm to solve the proposed model with stable and efficient convergence behavior. Finally, the ranking results are incorporated into the patch-based object features to address the background effects, and the structured SVM is then adopted to perform RGB-T tracking. Extensive experiments suggest that the proposed approach performs well against the state-of-the-art methods on large-scale benchmark datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chenglong_Li_Cross-Modal_Ranking_with_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chenglong Li, Chengli Zhu, Yan Huang, Jin Tang, Liang Wang
Transferring GANs: generating images from limited data	Transferring the knowledge of pretrained networks to new domains by means of finetuning is a widely used practice for applications based on discriminative models. To the best of our knowledge this practice has not been studied within the context of generative deep networks. Therefore, we study domain adaptation applied to image generation with generative adversarial networks. We evaluate several aspects of domain adaptation, including the impact of target domain size, the relative distance between source and target domain, and the initialization of conditional GANs. Our results show that using knowledge from pretrained networks can shorten the convergence time and can significantly improve the quality of the generated images, especially when the target data is limited. We show that these conclusions can also be drawn for conditional GANs even when the pretrained model was trained without conditioning. Our results also suggest that density may be more important than diversity and a dataset with one or few densely sampled classes may be a better source model than more diverse datasets such as ImageNet or Places.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/yaxing_wang_Transferring_GANs_generating_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yaxing Wang, Chenshen Wu, Luis Herranz, Joost van de Weijer, Abel Gonzalez-Garcia, Bogdan Raducanu
A Deeply-initialized Coarse-to-fine Ensemble of Regression Trees for Face Alignment	In this paper we present DCFE, a real-time facial landmark regression method based on a coarse-to-fine Ensemble of Regression Trees (ERT). We use a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to generate probability maps of landmarks location. These are further refined with the ERT regressor, which is initialized by fitting a 3D face model to the landmark maps. The coarse-to-fine structure of the ERT lets us address the combinatorial explosion of parts deformation. With the 3D model we also tackle other key problems such as robust regressor initialization, self occlusions, and simultaneous frontal and profile face analysis. In the experiments DCFE achieves the best reported result in AFLW, COFW, and 300W private and common public data sets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Roberto_Valle_A_Deeply-initialized_Coarse-to-fine_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Roberto Valle, Jose M.

Unsupervised Hard Example Mining from Videos for Improved Object Detection	Important gains have recently been obtained in object detection by using training objectives that focus on {em hard negative} examples, i.e., negative examples that are currently rated as positive or ambiguous by the detector. These examples can strongly influence parameters when the network is trained to correct them. Unfortunately, they are often sparse in the training data, and are expensive to obtain. In this work, we show how large numbers of hard negatives can be obtained {em automatically} by analyzing the output of a trained detector on video sequences. In particular, detections that are {em isolated in time}, i.e., that have no associated preceding or following detections, are likely to be hard negatives. We describe simple procedures for mining large numbers of such hard negatives (and also hard {em positives}) from unlabeled video data. Our experiments show that retraining detectors on these automatically obtained examples often significantly improves performance. We present experiments on multiple architectures and multiple data sets, including face detection, pedestrian detection and other object categories.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/SouYoung_Jin_Unsupervised_Hard-Negative_Mining_ECCV_2018_paper.php	SouYoung Jin, Aruni RoyChowdhury, Huaizu Jiang, Ashish Singh, Aditya Prasad, Deep Chakraborty, Erik Learned-Miller
FloorNet: A Unified Framework for Floorplan Reconstruction from 3D Scans	The ultimate goal of this indoor mapping research is to automatically reconstruct a floorplan simply by walking through a house with a smartphone in a pocket. This paper tackles this problem by proposing FloorNet, a novel deep neural architecture. The challenge lies in the processing of RGBD streams spanning a large 3D space. FloorNet effectively processes the data through three neural network branches: 1) PointNet with 3D points, exploiting the 3D information; 2) CNN with a 2D point density image in a top-down view, enhancing the local spatial reasoning; and 3) CNN with RGB images, utilizing the full image information. FloorNet exchanges intermediate features across the branches to exploit the best of all the architectures. We have created a benchmark for floorplan reconstruction by acquiring RGBD video streams for 155 residential houses or apartments with Google Tango phones and annotating complete floorplan information. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the fusion of three branches effectively improves the reconstruction quality. We hope that the paper together with the benchmark will be an important step towards solving a challenging vector-graphics reconstruction problem.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chen_Liu_FloorNet_A_Unified_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chen Liu, Jiaye Wu, Yasutaka Furukawa
Multimodal image alignment through a multiscale chain of neural networks with application to remote sensing	We tackle here the problem of multimodal image non-rigid registration, which is of prime importance in remote sensing and medical imaging. The difficulties encountered by classical registration approaches include feature design and slow optimization by gradient descent. By analyzing these methods, we note the significance of the notion of scale. We design easy-to-train, fully-convolutional neural networks able to learn scale-specific features. Once chained appropriately, they perform global registration in linear time, getting rid of gradient descent schemes by predicting directly the deformation. We show their performance in terms of quality and speed through various tasks of remote sensing multimodal image alignment. In particular, we are able to register correctly cadastral maps of buildings as well as road polylines onto RGB images, and outperform current keypoint matching methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Armand_Zampieri_Multimodal_image_alignment_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Armand Zampieri, Guillaume Charpiat, Nicolas Girard, Yuliya Tarabalka
Generative Domain-Migration Hashing for Sketch-to-Image Retrieval	Due to the succinct nature of free-hand sketch drawings, sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) has abundant practical use cases in consumer electronics. However, SBIR remains a long-standing unsolved problem mainly due to the significant discrepancy between the sketch domain and the image domain. In this work, we propose a Generative Domain-migration Hashing (GDH) approach, which for the first time generates hashing codes from synthetic natural images that are migrated from sketches. The generative model learns a mapping that the distributions of sketches can be indistinguishable from the distribution of natural images using an adversarial loss, and simultaneously learns an inverse mapping based on the cycle consistency loss in order to enhance the indistinguishability. With the robust mapping learned from the generative model, GDH can migrate sketches to their indistinguishable image counterparts while preserving the domain-invariant information of sketches. With an end-to-end multi-task learning framework, the generative model and binarized hashing codes can be jointly optimized. Comprehensive experiments of both category-level and fine-grained SBIR on multiple large-scale datasets demonstrate the consistently balanced superiority of GDH in terms of efficiency, memory costs and effectiveness.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jingyi_Zhang_Generative_Domain-Migration_Hashing_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jingyi Zhang, Fumin Shen, Li Liu, Fan Zhu, Mengyang Yu, Ling Shao, Heng Tao Shen, Luc Van Gool
BOP: Benchmark for 6D Object Pose Estimation	We propose a benchmark for 6D pose estimation of a rigid object from a single RGB-D input image. The training data consists of a texture-mapped 3D object model or images of the object in known 6D poses. The benchmark comprises of: i) eight datasets in a unified format that cover different practical scenarios, including two new datasets focusing on varying lighting conditions, ii) an evaluation methodology with a pose-error function that deals with pose ambiguities, iii) a comprehensive evaluation of 15 diverse recent methods that captures the status quo of the field, and iv) an online evaluation system that is open for continuous submission of new results. The evaluation shows that methods based on point-pair features currently perform best, outperforming template matching methods, learning-based methods and methods based on 3D local features. The project website is available at bop.felk.cvut.cz.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tomas_Hodan_PESTO_6D_Object_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tomas Hodan, Frank Michel, Eric Brachmann, Wadim Kehl, Anders GlentBuch, Dirk Kraft, Bertram Drost, Joel Vidal, Stephan Ihrke, Xenophon Zabulis, Caner Sahin, Fabian Manhardt, Federico Tombari, Tae-Kyun Kim, Jiri Matas, Carsten Rother
Diverse Image-to-Image Translation via Disentangled Representations	Image-to-image translation aims to learn the mapping between two visual domains. There are two main challenges for many applications: 1) the lack of aligned training pairs and 2) multiple possible outputs from a single input image. In this work, we present an approach based on disentangled representation for producing diverse outputs without paired training images. To achieve diversity, we propose to embed images onto two spaces: a domain-invariant content space capturing shared information across domains and a domain-specific attribute space. Using the disentangled features as inputs greatly reduces mode collapse. To handle unpaired training data, we introduce a novel cross-cycle consistency loss. Qualitative results show that our model can generate diverse and realistic images on a wide range of tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive evaluation.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hsin-Ying_Lee_Diverse_Image-to-Image_Translation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hsin-Ying Lee, Hung-Yu Tseng, Jia-Bin Huang, Maneesh Singh, Ming-Hsuan Yang
Diverse and Coherent Paragraph Generation from Images	Paragraph generation from images, which has gained popularity recently, is an important task for video summarization, editing, and support of the disabled. Traditional image captioning methods fall short on this front, since they aren't designed to generate long informative descriptions. Moreover, the vanilla approach of simply concatenating multiple short sentences, possibly synthesized from a classical image captioning system, doesn't embrace the intricacies of paragraphs: coherent sentences, globally consistent structure, and diversity. To address those challenges, we propose to augment paragraph generation techniques with ``coherence vectors,'' ``global topic vectors,'' and modeling of the inherent ambiguity of associating paragraphs with images, via a variational auto-encoder formulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach on two datasets, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques on both.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Moitreya_Chatterjee_Diverse_and_Coherent_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Moitreya Chatterjee, Alexander G.

Partial Adversarial Domain Adaptation	Domain adversarial learning aligns the feature distributions across the source and target domains in a two-player minimax game. Existing domain adversarial networks generally assume identical label space across different domains. In the presence of big data, there is strong motivation of transferring deep models from existing big domains to unknown small domains. This paper introduces partial domain adaptation as a new domain adaptation scenario, which relaxes the fully shared label space assumption to that the source label space subsumes the target label space. Previous methods typically match the whole source domain to the target domain, which are vulnerable to negative transfer for the partial domain adaptation problem due to the large mismatch between label spaces. We present Partial Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PADA), which simultaneously alleviates negative transfer by down-weighing the data of outlier source classes for training both source classifier and domain adversary, and promotes positive transfer by matching the feature distributions in the shared label space. Experiments show that PADA exceeds state-of-the-art results for partial domain adaptation tasks on several datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhangjie_Cao_Partial_Adversarial_Domain_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhangjie Cao, Lijia Ma, Mingsheng Long, Jianmin Wang
CGIntrinsics: Better Intrinsic Image Decomposition through Physically-Based Rendering	Intrinsic image decomposition is a long-standing, highly challenging computer vision problem, where ground truth data is very difficult to acquire. We explore the idea of using synthetic data to train CNN-based intrinsic image decomposition models, and applying these learned models to real-world images. To that end, we present CGINTRINSICS, a new, large-scale dataset of physically-based rendered images of scenes with full ground truth decompositions. The image generation process we use is carefully designed to yield high-quality, realistic images, which we find to be critical for this problem. We also propose a new end-to-end learning method that learns better decompositions by leveraging CGINTRINSICS , and optionally IIW and SAW, two recent datasets of sparse annotations on real-world images. Surprisingly, we find that a decomposition network trained solely on our synthetic data outperforms the state-of-the-art on both IIW and SAW, and performance improves even further when IIW and SAW data is added during training. Our work demonstrates the unreasonable effectiveness of carefully-rendered synthetic data for the intrinsic images task.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhengqi_Li_CGIntrinsics_Better_Intrinsic_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhengqi Li, Noah Snavely
Video Object Detection with an Aligned Spatial-Temporal Memory	We introduce Spatial-Temporal Memory Networks for video object detection. At its core, a novel Spatial-Temporal Memory module (STMM) serves as the recurrent computation unit to model long-term temporal appearance and motion dynamics. The STMM's design enables full integration of pretrained backbone CNN weights, which we find to be critical for accurate detection. Furthermore, in order to tackle object motion in videos, we propose a novel MatchTrans module to align the spatial-temporal memory from frame to frame. Our method produces state-of-the-art results on the benchmark ImageNet VID dataset, and our ablative studies clearly demonstrate the contribution of our different design choices. We release our code and models at http://fanyix.cs.ucdavis.edu/project/stmn/project.html.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Fanyi_Xiao_Object_Detection_with_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Fanyi Xiao, Yong Jae Lee
T2Net: Synthetic-to-Realistic Translation for Solving Single-Image Depth Estimation Tasks	Current methods for single-image depth estimation use training datasets with real image-depth pairs or stereo pairs, which are not easy to acquire. We propose a framework, trained on synthetic image-depth pairs and unpaired real images, that comprises an image translation network for enhancing realism of input images, followed by a depth prediction network. A key idea is having the first network act as a wide-spectrum input translator, taking in either synthetic or real images, and ideally producing minimally modified realistic images. This is done via a reconstruction loss when the training input is real, and a GAN loss when synthetic, removing the need for heuristic self-regularization. The second network is trained on a task loss for synthetic image-depth pairs, with an extra GAN loss to unify real and synthetic feature distributions. Importantly, the framework can be trained end-to-end, leading to good results, even surpassing early deep-learning methods that use real paired data.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chuanxia_Zheng_T2Net_Synthetic-to-Realistic_Translation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chuanxia Zheng, Tat-Jen Cham, Jianfei Cai
Interaction-aware Spatio-temporal Pyramid Attention Networks for Action Classification	Local features at neighboring spatial positions in feature maps have high correlation since their receptive fields are often overlapped. Self-attention usually uses the weighted sum (or other functions) with internal elements of each local feature to obtain its weight score, which ignores interactions among local features. To address this, we propose an effective interaction-aware self-attention model inspired by PCA to learn attention maps. Furthermore, since different layers in a deep network capture feature maps of different scales, we use these feature maps to construct a spatial pyramid and then utilize multi-scale information to obtain more accurate attention scores, which are used to weight the local features in all spatial positions of feature maps to calculate attention maps. Moreover, our spatial pyramid attention is unrestricted to the number of its input feature maps so it is easily extended to a spatio-temporal version. Finally, our model is embedded in general CNNs to form end-to-end attention networks for action classification. Experimental results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art results on the UCF101, HMDB51 and untrimmed Charades.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yang_Du_Interaction-aware_Spatio-temporal_Pyramid_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yang Du, Chunfeng Yuan, Bing Li, Lili Zhao, Yangxi Li, Weiming Hu
Out-of-Distribution Detection Using an Ensemble of Self Supervised Leave-out Classifiers	As deep learning methods form a critical part in commercially important applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics, it is important to reliably detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs while employing these algorithms. In this work, we propose an OOD detection algorithm which comprises of an ensemble of classifiers. We train each classifier in a self-supervised manner by leaving out a random subset of training data as OOD data and the rest as in-distribution (ID) data. We propose a novel margin-based loss over the softmax output which seeks to maintain at least a margin m between the average entropy of the OOD and in-distribution samples. In conjunction with the standard cross-entropy loss, we minimize the novel loss to train an ensemble of classifiers. We also propose a novel method to combine the outputs of the ensemble of classifiers to obtain OOD detection score and class prediction. Overall, our method convincingly outperforms Hendrycks et al. [7] and the current state-of-the-art ODIN [13] on several OOD detection benchmarks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Apoorv_Vyas_Out-of-Distribution_Detection_Using_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Apoorv Vyas, Nataraj Jammalamadaka, Xia Zhu, Dipankar Das, Bharat Kaul, Theodore L.

Learning SO(3) Equivariant Representations with Spherical CNNs	We address the problem of 3D rotation equivariance in convolutional neural networks. 3D rotations have been a challenging nuisance in 3D classification tasks requiring higher capacity and extended data augmentation in order to tackle it. We model 3D data with multi-valued spherical functions and we propose a novel spherical convolutional network that implements exact convolutions on the sphere by realizing them in the spherical harmonic domain. Resulting filters have local symmetry and are localized by enforcing smooth spectra. We apply a novel pooling on the spectral domain and our operations are independent of the underlying spherical resolution throughout the network. We show that networks with much lower capacity and without requiring data augmentation can exhibit performance comparable to the state of the art in standard retrieval and classification benchmarks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Carlos_Esteves_Learning_SO3_Equivariant_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Carlos Esteves, Christine Allen-Blanchette, Ameesh Makadia, Kostas Daniilidis
Dynamic Multimodal Instance Segmentation Guided by Natural Language Queries	We address the problem of segmenting an object given a natural language expression that describes it. Current techniques tackle this task by either ( extit{i}) directly or recursively merging linguistic and visual information in the channel dimension and then performing convolutions; or by ( extit{ii}) mapping the expression to a space in which it can be thought of as a filter, whose response is directly related to the presence of the object at a given spatial coordinate in the image, so that a convolution can be applied to look for the object. We propose a novel method that integrates these two insights in order to fully exploit the recursive nature of language. Additionally, during the upsampling process, we take advantage of the intermediate information generated when downsampling the image, so that detailed segmentations can be obtained. We compare our method against the state-of-the-art approaches in four standard datasets, in which it surpasses all previous methods in six of eight of the splits for this task.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Edgar_Margffoy-Tuay_Dynamic_Multimodal_Instance_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Edgar Margffoy-Tuay, Juan C.

Fast and Accurate Camera Covariance Computation for Large 3D Reconstruction	Estimating uncertainty of camera parameters computed in Structure from Motion (SfM) is an important tool for evaluating the quality of the reconstruction and guiding the reconstruction process. Yet, the quality of the estimated parameters of large reconstructions has been rarely evaluated due to the computational challenges. We present a new algorithm which employs the sparsity of the uncertainty propagation and speeds the computation up about ten times wrt previous approaches. Our computation is accurate and does not use any approximations. We can compute uncertainties of thousands of cameras in tens of seconds on a standard PC. We also demonstrate that our approach can be effectively used for reconstructions of any size by applying it to smaller sub-reconstructions.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Michal_Polic_Fast_and_Precise_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Michal Polic, Wolfgang Forstner, Tomas Pajdla
Seeing Deeply and Bidirectionally: A Deep Learning Approach for Single Image Reflection Removal	Reflections often obstruct the desired scene when taking photos through glass panels. Removing unwanted reflection automatically from the photos is highly desirable. Traditional methods often impose certain priors or assumptions to target particular type(s) of reflection such as shifted double reflection, thus have difficulty to generalise to other types. Very recently a deep learning approach has been proposed. It learns a deep neural network that directly maps a reflection contaminated image to a background (target) image (ie reflection free image) in an end to end fashion, and outperforms the previous methods. We argue that, to remove reflection truly well, we should estimate the reflection and utilise it to estimate the background image. We propose a cascade deep neural network, which estimates both the background image and the reflection. This significantly improves reflection removal. In the cascade deep network, we use the estimated background image to estimate the reflection, and then use the estimated reflection to estimate the background image, facilitating our idea of seeing deeply and bidirectionally.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jie_Yang_Seeing_Deeply_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jie Yang, Dong Gong, Lingqiao Liu, Qinfeng Shi
Adding Attentiveness to the Neurons in Recurrent Neural Networks	Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are capable of modeling the temporal dynamics of complex sequential information. However, the structures of existing RNN neurons mainly focus on controlling the contributions of current and historical information but do not explore the different importance levels of different elements in an input vector of a time slot. We propose adding a simple yet effective Element-wise-Attention Gate (EleAttG) to an RNN block (e.g., all RNN neurons in a network layer) that empowers the RNN neurons to have the attentiveness capability. For an RNN block, an EleAttG is added to adaptively modulate the input by assigning different levels of importance, i.e., attention, to each element/dimension of the input. We refer to an RNN block equipped with an EleAttG as an EleAtt-RNN block. Specically, the modulation of the input is content adaptive and is performed at ne granularity, being element-wise rather than input-wise. The proposed EleAttG, as an additional fundamental unit, is general and can be applied to any RNN structures, e.g., standard RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EleAtt-RNN by applying it to the action recognition tasks on both 3D human skeleton data and RGB videos. Experiments show that adding attentiveness through EleAttGs to RNN blocks signicantly boosts the power of RNNs.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Pengfei_Zhang_Adding_Attentiveness_to_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Pengfei Zhang, Jianru Xue, Cuiling Lan, Wenjun Zeng, Zhanning Gao, Nanning Zheng
Deep Imbalanced Attribute Classification using Visual Attention Aggregation	For many computer vision applications, such as image description and human identification recognizing the visual attributes of humans is an essential yet challenging problem. Its challenges originate from its multi-label nature, the large underlying class imbalance and the lack of spatial annotations. Existing methods follow either a computer vision approach while failing to account for class imbalance, or explore machine learning solutions, which disregard the spatial and semantic relations that exist in the images. With that in mind, we propose an effective method that extracts and aggregates visual attention masks at different scales. We introduce a loss function to handle class imbalance both at class and at an instance level and further demonstrate that penalizing attention masks with high prediction variance accounts for the weak supervision of the attention mechanism. By identifying and addressing these challenges, we achieve state-of-the-art results with a simple attention mechanism in both PETA and WIDER-Attribute datasets without additional context or side information.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Nikolaos_Sarafianos_Deep_Imbalanced_Attribute_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Nikolaos Sarafianos, Xiang Xu, Ioannis A.

Polarimetric Three-View Geometry	This paper theorizes the connection between polarization and three-view geometry. It presents a ubiquitous polarization-induced constraint that regulates the relative pose of a system of three cameras. We demonstrate that, in a multi-view system, the polarization phase obtained for a surface point is induced from one of the two pencils of planes: one by specular reflections with its axis aligned with the incident light; one by diffusive reflections with its axis aligned with the surface normal. Differing from the traditional three-view geometry, we show that this constraint directly encodes camera rotation and projection, and is independent of camera translation. In theory, six polarized diffusive point-point-point correspondences suffice to determine the camera rotations. In practise, a cross-validation mechanism using correspondences of specularites can effectively resolve the ambiguities caused by mixed polarization. The experiments on real world scenes validate our proposed theory.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Lixiong_Chen_Polarimetric_Three-View_Geometry_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Lixiong Chen, Yinqiang Zheng, Art Subpa-asa, Imari Sato
Saliency Preservation in Low-Resolution Grayscale Images	Visual salience detection originated over 500 million years ago and is one of nature's most efficient mechanisms. In contrast, many state-of-the-art computational saliency models are complex and inefficient. Most saliency models process high-resolution color (HC) images; however, insights into the evolutionary origins of visual salience detection suggest that achromatic low-resolution vision is essential to its speed and efficiency. Previous studies showed that low-resolution color and high-resolution grayscale images preserve saliency information. However, to our knowledge, no one has investigated whether saliency is preserved in low-resolution grayscale (LG) images. In this study, we explain the biological and computational motivation for LG, and show, through a range of human eye-tracking and computational modeling experiments, that saliency information is preserved in LG images. Moreover, we show that using LG images leads to significant speedups in model training and detection times and conclude by proposing LG images for fast and efficient salience detection.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Shivanthan_Yohanandan_Saliency_Preservation_in_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Shivanthan Yohanandan, Andy Song, Adrian G.

Efficient Uncertainty Estimation for Semantic Segmentation in Videos	Uncertainty estimation in deep learning becomes more important recently. A deep learning model can't be applied in real applications if we don't know whether the model is certain about the decision or not. Some literature proposes the Bayesian neural network which can estimate the uncertainty by Monte Carlo Dropout (MC dropout). However, MC dropout needs to forward the model N times which results in N times slower. For real-time applications such as a self-driving car system, which needs to obtain the prediction and the uncertainty as fast as possible, so that MC dropout becomes impractical. In this work, we propose the region-based temporal aggregation (RTA) method which leverages the temporal information in videos to simulate the sampling procedure. Our RTA method with Tiramisu backbone is 10x faster than the MC dropout with Tiramisu backbone (N=5). Furthermore, the uncertainty estimation obtained by our RTA method is comparable to MC dropout's uncertainty estimation on pixel-level and frame-level metrics.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Po-Yu_Huang_Efficient_Uncertainty_Estimation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Po-Yu Huang, Wan-Ting Hsu, Chun-Yueh Chiu, Ting-Fan Wu, Min Sun
Graph Distillation for Action Detection with Privileged Modalities	We propose a technique that tackles action detection in multimodal videos under a realistic and challenging condition in which only limited training data and partially observed modalities are available. Common methods in transfer learning do not take advantage of the extra modalities potentially available in the source domain. On the other hand, previous work on multimodal learning only focuses on a single domain or task and does not handle the modality discrepancy between training and testing. In this work, we propose a method termed graph distillation that incorporates rich privileged information from a large-scale multimodal dataset in the source domain, and improves the learning in the target domain where training data and modalities are scarce. We evaluate our approach on action classification and detection tasks in multimodal videos, and show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin on the NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD benchmarks. The code is released at http://alan.vision/eccv18_graph/.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zelun_Luo_Graph_Distillation_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zelun Luo, Jun-Ting Hsieh, Lu Jiang, Juan Carlos Niebles, Li Fei-Fei
Object Detection in Video with Spatiotemporal Sampling Networks	We propose a Spatiotemporal Sampling Network (STSN) that uses deformable convolutions across time for object detection in videos. Our STSN performs object detection in a video frame by learning to spatially sample features from the adjacent frames. This naturally renders the approach robust to occlusion or motion blur in individual frames. Our framework does not require additional supervision, as it optimizes sampling locations directly with respect to object detection performance. Our STSN outperforms the state-of-the-art on the ImageNet VID dataset and compared to prior video object detection methods it uses a simpler design, and does not require optical flow data for training.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Gedas_Bertasius_Object_Detection_in_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Gedas Bertasius, Lorenzo Torresani, Jianbo Shi
Fine-grained Video Categorization with Redundancy Reduction Attention	For fine-grained categorization tasks, videos could serve as a better source than static images as videos have a higher chance of containing discriminative patterns. Nevertheless, a video sequence could also contain a lot of redundant and irrelevant frames. How to locate critical information of interest is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a new network structure, known as Redundancy Reduction Attention (RRA), which learns to focus on multiple discriminative patterns by suppressing redundant feature channels. Specifically, it firstly summarizes the video by weight-summing all feature vectors in the feature maps of selected frames with a spatio-temporal soft attention, and then predicts which channels to suppress or to enhance according to this summary with a learned non-linear transform. Suppression is achieved by modulating the feature maps and threshing out weak activations. The updated feature maps are then used in the next iteration. Finally, the video is classified based on multiple summaries. The proposed method achieves outstanding performances in multiple video classification datasets. Furthermore, we have collected two large-scale video datasets, YouTube-Birds and YouTube-Cars, for future researches on fine-grained video categorization. The datasets are available at http://www.cs.umd.edu/~chenzhu/fgvc.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chen_Zhu_Fine-grained_Video_Categorization_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chen Zhu, Xiao Tan, Feng Zhou, Xiao Liu, Kaiyu Yue, Errui Ding, Yi Ma
Learning Class Prototypes via Structure Alignment for Zero-Shot Recognition	Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize objects of novel classes without any training samples of specific classes, which is achieved by exploiting the semantic information and auxiliary datasets. Recently most ZSL approaches focus on learning visual-semantic embeddings to transfer knowledge from the auxiliary datasets to the novel classes. However, few works study whether the semantic information is discriminative or not for the recognition task. To tackle such problem, we propose a coupled dictionary learning approach to align the visual-semantic structures using the class prototypes, where the discriminative information lying in the visual space is utilized to improve the less discriminative semantic space. Then, zero-shot recognition can be performed in different spaces by the simple nearest neighbor approach using the learned class prototypes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Huajie_Jiang_Learning_Class_Prototypes_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Huajie Jiang, Ruiping Wang, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen
Learning Blind Video Temporal Consistency	Applying image processing algorithms independently to each frame of a video often leads to undesired inconsistent results over time. Developing temporally consistent video-based extensions, however, requires domain knowledge for individual tasks and is unable to generalize to other applications. In this paper, we present an efficient end-to-end approach based on deep recurrent network for enforcing temporal consistency in a video.Our method takes the original unprocessed and per-frame processed videos as inputs to produce a temporally consistent video.Consequently, our approach is agnostic to specific image processing algorithms applied on the original video.We train the proposed network by minimizing both short-term and long-term temporal losses as well as the perceptual loss to strike a balance between temporal stability and perceptual similarity with the processed frames.At test time, our model does not require computing optical flow and thus achieves real-time speed even for high-resolution videos. We show that our single model can handle multiple and unseen tasks, including but not limited to artistic style transfer, enhancement, colorization, image-to-image translation and intrinsic image decomposition.Extensive objective evaluation and subject study demonstrate that the proposed approach performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on various types of videos.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Wei-Sheng_Lai_Real-Time_Blind_Video_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Wei-Sheng Lai, Jia-Bin Huang, Oliver Wang, Eli Shechtman, Ersin Yumer, Ming-Hsuan Yang
Interpolating Convolutional Neural Networks Using Batch Normalization	Perceiving a visual concept as a mixture of learned ones is natural for humans, aiding them to grasp new concepts and strengthening old ones. For all their power and recent success, deep convolutional networks do not have this ability. Inspired by recent work on universal representations for neural networks, we propose a simple emulation of this mechanism by purposing batch normalization layers to discriminate visual classes, and formulating a way to combine them to solve new tasks. We show that this can be applied for 2-way few-shot learning where we obtain between 4% and 17% better accuracy compared to straightforward full fine-tuning, and demonstrate that it can also be extended to the orthogonal application of style transfer.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Gratianus_Wesley_Putra_Data_Interpolating_Convolutional_Neural_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Gratianus Wesley Putra Data, Kirjon Ngu, David William Murray, Victor Adrian Prisacariu
Transductive Semi-Supervised Deep Learning using Min-Max Features	In this paper, we propose Transductive Semi-Supervised Deep Learning (TSSDL) method that is effective for training Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) models. The method applies transductive learning principle to DCNN training, introduces confidence levels on unlabeled image samples to overcome unreliable label estimates on outliers and uncertain samples, and develops the Min-Max Feature (MMF) regularization that encourages DCNN to learn feature descriptors with better between-class separability and within-class compactness. TSSDL method is independent of any DCNN architectures and complementary to the latest Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods. Comprehensive experiments on the benchmark datasets CIFAR10 and SVHN have shown that the DCNN model trained by the proposed TSSDL method can produce image classification accuracies compatible to the state-of-the-art SSL methods, and that combining TSSDL with the Mean Teacher method can produce the best classification accuracies on the two benchmark datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Weiwei_Shi_Transductive_Semi-Supervised_Deep_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Weiwei Shi, Yihong Gong, Chris Ding, Zhiheng MaXiaoyu Tao, Nanning Zheng
Discriminative Region Proposal Adversarial Networks for High-Quality Image-to-Image Translation	"Image-to-image translation has been made much progress with embracing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, it's still very challenging for translation tasks that require high quality, especially at high-resolution and photorealism. In this paper, we present Discriminative Region Proposal Adversarial Networks (DRPAN) for high-quality image-to-image translation. We decompose the procedure of image-to-image translation task into three iterated steps, first is to generate an image with global structure but some local artifacts (via GAN), second is using our DRPnet to propose the most fake region from the generated image, and third is to implement ""image inpainting"" on the most fake region for more realistic result through a reviser, so that the system (DRPAN) can be gradually optimized to synthesize images with more attention on the most artifact local part. Experiments on a variety of image-to-image translation tasks and datasets validate that our method outperforms state-of-the-arts for producing high-quality translation results in terms of both human perceptual studies and automatic quantitative measures."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chao_Wang_Discriminative_Region_Proposal_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chao Wang, Haiyong Zheng, Zhibin Yu, Ziqiang Zheng, Zhaorui Gu, Bing Zheng
Uncertainty Estimates and Multi-Hypotheses Networks for Optical Flow	Optical flow estimation can be formulated as an end-to-end supervised learning problem, which yields estimates with a superior accuracy-runtime tradeoff compared to alternative methodology. In this paper, we make such networks estimate their local uncertainty about the correctness of their prediction, which is vital information when building decisions on top of the estimations. For the first time we compare several strategies and techniques to estimate uncertainty in a large-scale computer vision task like optical flow estimation. Moreover, we introduce a new network architecture and loss function that enforce complementary hypotheses and provide uncertainty estimates efficiently with a single forward pass and without the need for sampling or ensembles. We demonstrate the quality of the uncertainty estimates, which is clearly above previous confidence measures on optical flow and allows for interactive frame rates.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Eddy_Ilg_Uncertainty_Estimates_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Eddy Ilg, Ozgun Cicek, Silvio Galesso, Aaron Klein, Osama Makansi, Frank Hutter, Thomas Brox
HybridNet: Classification and Reconstruction Cooperation for Semi-Supervised Learning	In this paper, we introduce a new model for leveraging unlabeled data to improve generalization performances of image classifiers: a two-branch encoder-decoder architecture called HybridNet. The first branch receives supervision signal and is dedicated to the extraction of invariant class-related representations. The second branch is fully unsupervised and dedicated to model information discarded by the first branch to reconstruct input data. To further support the expected behavior of our model, we propose an original training objective. It favors stability in the discriminative branch and complementarity between the learned representations in the two branches. HybridNet is able to outperform state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10, SVHN and STL-10 in various semi-supervised settings. In addition, visualizations and ablation studies validate our contributions and the behavior of the model on both CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Thomas_Robert_HybridNet_Classification_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Thomas Robert, Nicolas Thome, Matthieu Cord
Bayesian Semantic Instance Segmentation in Open Set World	This paper addresses the semantic instance segmentation task in the open-set conditions, where input images can contain known and unknown object classes. The training process of existing semantic instance segmentation methods requires annotation masks for all object instances, which is expensive to acquire or even infeasible in some realistic scenarios, where the number of categories may increase boundlessly. In this paper, we present a novel open-set semantic instance segmentation approach capable of segmenting all known and unknown object classes in images, based on the output of an object detector trained on known object classes. We formulate the problem using a Bayesian framework, where the posterior distribution is approximated with a simulated annealing optimization equipped with an efficient image partition sampler. We show empirically that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art supervised methods on known classes, but also performs well on unknown classes when compared with unsupervised methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Trung_Pham_Bayesian_Instance_Segmentation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Trung Pham, Vijay Kumar B.

Light Structure from Pin Motion: Simple and Accurate Point Light Calibration for Physics-based Modeling	We present a practical method for geometric point light source calibration. Unlike in prior works that use Lambertian spheres, mirror spheres, or mirror planes, our calibration target consists of a Lambertian plane and small shadow casters at unknown positions above the plane. Due to their small size, the casters' shadows can be localized more precisely than highlights on mirrors. We show that, given shadow observations from a moving calibration target and a fixed camera, the shadow caster positions and the light position or direction can be simultaneously recovered in a structure from motion framework. Our evaluation on simulated and real scenes shows that our method yields light estimates that are stable and more accurate than existing techniques while having a considerably simpler setup and requiring less manual labor.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hiroaki_Santo_Light_Structure_from_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hiroaki Santo, Michael Waechter, Masaki Samejima, Yusuke Sugano, Yasuyuki Matsushita
Escaping from Collapsing Modes in a Constrained Space	Generative adversarial networks (GANs) often suffer from unpredictable mode-collapsing during training. We study the issue of mode collapse of Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Network (BEGAN), which is one of the state-of-the-art generative models. Despite its potential of generating high-quality images, we find that BEGAN tends to collapse at some modes after a period of training. We propose a new model, called BEGAN with a Constrained Space (BEGAN-CS), which includes a latent-space constraint in the loss function. We show that BEGAN-CS can significantly improve training stability and suppress mode collapse without either increasing the model complexity or degrading the image quality. Further, we visualize the distribution of latent vectors to elucidate the effect of latent-space constraint. The experimental results show that our method has additional advantages of being able to train on small datasets and to generate images similar to a given real image but with variations of designated attributes on-the-fly.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chieh_Lin_Escaping_from_Collapsing_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chia-Che Chang, Chieh Hubert Lin, Che-Rung Lee, Da-Cheng Juan, Wei Wei, Hwann-Tzong Chen
Question Type Guided Attention in Visual Question Answering	"Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires integration of feature maps with drastically different structures and focus of the correct regions. Image descriptors have structures at multiple spatial scales, while lexical inputs inherently follow a temporal sequence and naturally cluster into semantically different question types. A lot of previous works use complex models to extract feature representations but neglect to use high-level information summary such as question types in learning . In this work, we propose Question Type-guided Attention (QTA). It utilizes the information of question type to dynamically balance between bottom-up and top-down visual features, respectively extracted from ResNet and Faster R-CNN networks. We experiment with multiple VQA architectures with extensive input ablation studies over the TDIUC dataset and show that QTA systematically improves the performance by more than 5% across multiple question type categories such as ""Activity Recognition"", ""Utility"" and ""Counting"" on TDIUC dataset compared to the state-of-art. By adding QTA on the state-of-art model MCB, we achieve 3% improvement for overall accuracy. Finally, we propose a multitask extension to predict question types which generalizes QTA to applications that lack of question type, with minimal performance loss."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yang_Shi_Question_Type_Guided_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yang Shi, Tommaso Furlanello, Sheng Zha, Animashree Anandkumar
Distractor-aware Siamese Networks for Visual Object Tracking	Recently, Siamese networks have drawn great attention in visual tracking community because of their balanced accuracy and speed. However, features used in most Siamese tracking approaches can only discriminate foreground from the non-semantic backgrounds. The semantic backgrounds are always considered as distractors, which hinders the robustness of Siamese trackers. In this paper, we focus on learning distractor-aware Siamese networks for accurate and long-term tracking. To this end, features used in traditional Siamese trackers are analyzed at first. We observe that the imbalanced distribution of training data makes the learned features less discriminative. During the off-line training phase, an effective sampling strategy is introduced to control this distribution and make the model focus on the semantic distractors. During inference, a novel distractor-aware module is designed to perform incremental learning, which can effectively transfer the general embedding to the current video domain. In addition, we extend the proposed approach for long-term tracking by introducing a simple yet effective local-to-global search region strategy. Extensive experiments on benchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts, yielding 9.6% relative gain in VOT2016 dataset and 35.9% relative gain in UAV20L dataset. The proposed tracker can perform at 160 FPS on short-term benchmarks and 110 FPS on long-term benchmarks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zheng_Zhu_Distractor-aware_Siamese_Networks_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zheng Zhu, Qiang Wang, Bo Li, Wei Wu, Junjie Yan, Weiming Hu
Learning to Anonymize Faces for Privacy Preserving Action Detection	There is an increasing concern in computer vision devices invading the privacy of their users. We want the camera systems/robots to recognize important events and assist human daily life by understanding its videos, but we also want to ensure that they do not intrude people's privacy. In this paper, we propose a new principled approach for learning a video anonymizer. We use an adversarial training setting in which two competing systems fight: (1) a video anonymizer that modifies the original video to remove privacy-sensitive information (i.e., human face) while still trying to maximize spatial action detection performance, and (2) a discriminator that tries to extract privacy-sensitive information from such anonymized videos. The end goal is for the video anonymizer to perform a pixel-level modification of video frames to anonymize each person's face, while minimizing the effect on action detection performance. We experimentally confirm the benefit of our approach particularly compared to conventional hand-crafted video/face anonymization methods including masking, blurring, and noise adding.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhongzheng_Ren_Learning_to_Anonymize_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhongzheng Ren, Yong Jae Lee, Michael S.

Monocular Depth Estimation with Affinity, Vertical Pooling, and Label Enhancement	While significant progress has been made in monocular depth estimation with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) extracting absolute features, such as edges and textures, the depth constraint of neighboring pixels, namely relative features, has been mostly ignored by recent methods. To overcome this limitation, we explicitly model the relationships of different image locations with an affinity layer and combine absolute and relative features in an end-to-end network. In addition, we also consider another prior knowledge that major depth changes in images lie in the vertical direction, and thus, it is beneficial to capture local vertical features for refined depth estimation. In the proposed algorithm we introduce vertical pooling to aggregate image features vertically to improve the depth accuracy.Furthermore, since the Lidar depth ground truth is quite sparse, we enhance the depth labels by generating high-quality dense depth maps with off-the-shelf stereo matching method which takes left-right image pairs as input.We also integrate multi-scale structures in our network to obtain global understanding the image depth and exploit residual learning to help depth refinement.We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively on the KITTI driving dataset.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/YuKang_Gan_Monocular_Depth_Estimation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yukang Gan, Xiangyu Xu, Wenxiu Sun, Liang Lin
Improving Generalization via Scalable Neighborhood Component Analysis	Current visual recognition is dominated by the end-to-end formulation of classification problems implemented by the parametric softmax classifiers. Such formulation makes a closed world assumption with a fixed set of categories. This becomes problematic for open-set scenarios where new categories are encountered with very few examples for learning a generalizable parametric classifier. This paper adopts a non-parametric approach for visual recognition by optimizing feature embeddings instead of parametric classifiers. We use a deep neural network to learn embeddings which preserves neighborhood structures by neighborhood component analysis (NCA). Limited by its computational bottlenecks, we devise a mechanism to use an augmented memory to scale NCA for large datasets and very deep neural networks. Our experimental results show state-of-the-art results on ImageNet classification using nearest neighbor classifiers. More importantly, our feature embedding is more generalizable for new categories such as sub-category discovery and few-shot recognition.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhirong_Wu_Improving_Embedding_Generalization_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhirong Wu, Alexei A.

Statistically-motivated Second-order Pooling	However, the nature of such operations is usually computationally expensive, and resulting vector representation orders of magnitude larger than first-order baselines. Here, by contrast, we introduce a statistically-motivated framework that projects the second-order descriptor into a compact vector while improving the representational power. To this end, we design a parametric vectorization layer, which maps a covariance matrix, known to follow a Wishart distribution, to a vector whose elements can be shown to follow a Chi-square distribution. We then propose to make use of a square-root normalization, which makes the distribution of the resulting representation converge to a Gaussian, with which most classifiers of recent first-order networks complying. As evidenced by our experiments, this lets us outperform the state-of-the-art first-order and second-order models on several benchmark recognition datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Kaicheng_Yu_Statistically-motivated_Second-order_Pooling_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Kaicheng Yu, Mathieu Salzmann
ML-LocNet: Improving Object Localization with Multi-view Learning Network	This paper addresses Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL) with only image-level supervision. We propose a Multi-view Learning Localization Network (ML-LocNet) by incorporating multi-view learning into a two-phase WSOL model. The multi-view learning would benefit localization due to the complementary relationships among the learned features from different views and the consensus property among the mined instances from each view. In the first phase, the representation is augmented by integrating features learned from multiple views, and in the second phase, the model performs multi-view co-training to enhance localization performance of one view with the help of instances mined from other views, which thus effectively avoids early fitting. ML-LocNet can be easily combined with existing WSOL models to further improve the localization accuracy. Its effectiveness has been proved experimentally. Notably, it achieves 68.6% CorLoc and 49.7% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007, surpassing the state-of-the-arts by a large margin.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiaopeng_Zhang_ML-LocNet_Improving_Object_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiaopeng Zhang, Yang Yang, Jiashi Feng
Learning to Forecast and Refine Residual Motion for Image-to-Video Generation	We consider the problem of image-to-video translation, where an input image is translated into an output video containing motions of a single object. Recent methods for such problems typically train transformation networks to generate future frames conditioned on the structure sequence. Parallel work has shown that short high-quality motions can be generated by spatiotemporal generative networks that leverage temporal knowledge from the training data. We combine the benefits of both approaches and propose a two-stage generation framework where videos are generated from structures and then refined by temporal signals. To model motions more efficiently, we train networks to learn residual motion between the current and future frames, which avoids learning motion-irrelevant details. We conduct extensive experiments on two image-to-video translation tasks: facial expression retargeting and human pose forecasting. Superior results over the state-of-the-art methods on both tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Long_Zhao_Learning_to_Forecast_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Long Zhao, Xi Peng, Yu Tian, Mubbasir Kapadia, Dimitris Metaxas
Graininess-Aware Deep Feature Learning for Pedestrian Detection	In this paper, we propose a graininess-aware deep feature learning method for pedestrian detection. Unlike most existing pedestrian detection methods which only consider low resolution feature maps, we incorporate fine-grained information into convolutional features to make them more discriminative for human body parts. Specifically, we propose a pedestrian attention mechanism which efficiently identifies pedestrian regions. Our method encodes fine-grained attention masks into convolutional feature maps, which significantly suppresses background interference and highlights pedestrians. Hence, our graininess-aware features become more focused on pedestrians, in particular those of small size and with occlusion. We further introduce a zoom-in-zoom-out module, which enhances the features by incorporating local details and context information. We integrate these two modules into a deep neural network, forming an end-to-end trainable pedestrian detector. Comprehensive experimental results on four challenging pedestrian benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chunze_Lin_Graininess-Aware_Deep_Feature_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chunze Lin, Jiwen Lu, Gang Wang, Jie Zhou
SphereNet: Learning Spherical Representations for Detection and Classification in Omnidirectional Images	Omnidirectional cameras offer great benefits over classical cameras wherever a wide field of view is essential, such as in virtual reality applications or in autonomous robots. Unfortunately, standard convolutional neural networks are not well suited for this scenario as the natural projection surface is a sphere which cannot be unwrapped to a plane without introducing significant distortions, particularly in the polar regions. In this work, we present SphereNet, a novel deep learning framework which encodes invariance against such distortions explicitly into convolutional neural networks. Towards this goal, SphereNet adapts the sampling locations of the convolutional filters, effectively reversing distortions, and wraps the filters around the sphere. By building on regular convolutions, SphereNet enables the transfer of existing perspective convolutional neural network models to the omnidirectional case. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the tasks of image classification and object detection, exploiting two newly created semi-synthetic and real-world omnidirectional datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Benjamin_Coors_SphereNet_Learning_Spherical_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Benjamin Coors, Alexandru Paul Condurache, Andreas Geiger
Zero-Shot Deep Domain Adaptation	Domain adaptation is an important tool to transfer knowledge about a task (e.g. classification) learned in a source domain to a second, or target domain. Current approaches assume that task-relevant target-domain data is available during training. We demonstrate how to perform domain adaptation when no such task-relevant target-domain data is available. To tackle this issue, we propose zero-shot deep domain adaptation (ZDDA), which uses privileged information from task-irrelevant dual-domain pairs. ZDDA learns a source-domain representation which is not only tailored for the task of interest but also close to the target-domain representation. Therefore, the source-domain task of interest solution (e.g. a classifier for classification tasks) which is jointly trained with the source-domain representation can be applicable to both the source and target representations. Using the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, NIST, EMNIST, and SUN RGB-D datasets, we show that ZDDA can perform domain adaptation in classification tasks without access to task-relevant target-domain training data. We also extend ZDDA to perform sensor fusion in the SUN RGB-D scene classification task by simulating task-relevant target-domain representations with task-relevant source-domain data. To the best of our knowledge, ZDDA is the first domain adaptation and sensor fusion method which requires no task-relevant target-domain data. The underlying principle is not particular to computer vision data, but should be extensible to other domains.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Kuan-Chuan_Peng_Zero-Shot_Deep_Domain_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Kuan-Chuan Peng, Ziyan Wu, Jan Ernst
Learning Dynamic Memory Networks for Object Tracking	Template-matching methods for visual tracking have gained popularity recently due to their comparable performance and fast speed. However, they lack effective ways to adapt to changes in the target object's appearance, making their tracking accuracy still far from state-of-the-art. In this paper, we propose a dynamic memory network to adapt the template to the target's appearance variations during tracking. An LSTM is used as a memory controller, where the input is the search feature map and the outputs are the control signals for the reading and writing process of the memory block. As the location of the target is at first unknown in the search feature map, an attention mechanism is applied to concentrate the LSTM input on the potential target. To prevent aggressive model adaptivity, we apply gated residual template learning to control the amount of retrieved memory that is used to combine with the initial template. Unlike tracking-by-detection methods where the object's information is maintained by the weight parameters of neural networks, which requires expensive online fine-tuning to be adaptable, our tracker runs completely feed-forward and adapts to the target's appearance changes by updating the external memory. Moreover, unlike other tracking methods where the model capacity is fixed after offline training – the capacity of our tracker can be easily enlarged as the memory require- ments of a task increase, which is favorable for memorizing long-term ob- ject information. Extensive experiments on OTB and VOT demonstrates that our tracker MemTrack performs favorably against state-of-the-art tracking methods while retaining real-time speed of 50 fps.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tianyu_Yang_Learning_Dynamic_Memory_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tianyu Yang, Antoni B.

On Regularized Losses for Weakly-supervised CNN Segmentation	Minimization of regularized losses is a principled approach to weak supervision well-established in deep learning, in general. However, it is largely overlooked in semantic segmentation currently dominated by methods mimicking full supervision via ``fake'' fully-labeled masks (proposals) generated from available partial input. To obtain such full masks the typical methods explicitly use standard regularization techniques for ``shallow'' segmentation, e.g. graph cuts or dense CRFs. In contrast, we integrate such standard regularizers directly into the loss functions over partial input. This approach simplifies weakly-supervised training by avoiding extra MRF/CRF inference steps or layers explicitly generating full masks, while improving both the quality and efficiency of training. This paper proposes and experimentally compares different losses integrating MRF/CRF regularization terms. We juxtapose our regularized losses with earlier proposal-generation methods. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in semantic segmentation with near full-supervision quality.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Meng_Tang_On_Regularized_Losses_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Meng Tang, Federico Perazzi, Abdelaziz Djelouah, Ismail Ben Ayed, Christopher Schroers, Yuri Boykov
OmniDepth: Dense Depth Estimation for Indoors Spherical Panoramas	Recent work on depth estimation up to now has only focused on projective images ignoring 360 content which is now increasingly and more easily produced. We show that monocular depth estimation models trained on traditional images produce sub-optimal results on omnidirectional images, showcasing the need for training directly on 360 datasets, which however, are hard to acquire. In this work, we circumvent the challenges associated with acquiring high quality 360 datasets with ground truth depth annotations, by re-using recently released large scale 3D datasets and re-purposing them to 360 via rendering. This dataset, which is considerably larger than similar projective datasets, is publicly offered to the community to enable future research in this direction. We use this dataset to learn in an end-to-end fashion the task of depth estimation from 360 images. We show promising results in our synthesized data as well as in unseen realistic images.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/NIKOLAOS_ZIOULIS_OmniDepth_Dense_Depth_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Nikolaos Zioulis, Antonis Karakottas, Dimitrios Zarpalas, Petros Daras
Dense Semantic and Topological Correspondence of 3D Faces without Landmarks	Many previous literatures use landmarks to guide the cor- respondence of 3D faces. However, these landmarks, either manually or automatically annotated, are hard to define consistently across differ- ent faces in many circumstances. We propose a general framework for dense correspondence of 3D faces without landmarks in this paper. The dense correspondence goal is revisited in two perspectives: semantic and topological correspondence. Starting from a template facial mesh, we sequentially perform global alignment, primary correspondence by tem- plate warping, and contextual mesh refinement, to reach the final cor- respondence result. The semantic correspondence is achieved by a local iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm of kernelized version, allowing accurate matching of local features. Then, robust deformation from the template to the target face is formulated as a minimization problem. Fur- thermore, this problem leads to a well-posed sparse linear system such that the solution is unique and efficient. Finally, a contextual mesh re- fining algorithm is applied to ensure topological correspondence. In the experiment, the proposed method is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively on two datasets including a publicly available FRGC v2.0 dataset, demonstrating reasonable and reliable correspondence results.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhenfeng_Fan_Dense_Semantic_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhenfeng Fan, Xiyuan Hu, Chen Chen, Silong Peng
Deblurring Natural Image Using Super-Gaussian Fields	Blind image deblurring is a challenging problem due to its ill-posed nature, of which the success is closely related to a proper image prior. Although a large number of sparsity-based priors, such as the sparse gradient prior, have been successfully applied for blind image deblurring, they inherently suffer from several drawbacks, limiting their applications. Existing sparsity-based priors are usually rooted in modeling the response of images to some specific filters (e.g., image gradients), which are insufficient to capture the complicated image structures. Moreover, the traditional sparse priors or regularizations model the filter response (e.g., image gradients) independently and thus fail to depict the long range correlation among them. To address the above issues, we present a novel image prior for image deblurring based on a Super-Gaussian field model with adaptive structures. Instead of modeling the response of the fixed short-term filters, the proposed Super-Gaussian fields capture the complicated structures in natural images by integrating potentials on all cliques (e.g., centring at each pixel) into a joint probabilistic distribution. Considering that the fixed filters in different scales are impractical for the coarse-to-fine framework of image deblurring, we define each potential function as a super-Gaussian distribution. Through this definition, the partition function, the curse for traditional MRFs, can be theoretically ignored, and all model parameters of the proposed Super-Gaussian fields can be data-adaptively learned and inferred from the blurred observation with a variational framework. Extensive experiments on both blind deblurring and non-blind deblurring demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yuhang_Liu_Deblurring_Natural_Image_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yuhang Liu, Wenyong Dong, Dong Gong, Lei Zhang, Qinfeng Shi
``Factual'' or ``Emotional'': Stylized Image Captioning with Adaptive Learning and Attention	Generating stylized captions for an image is an emerging topic in image captioning. Given an image as input, it requires the system to generate a caption that has a specific style (e.g., humorous, romantic, positive, and negative) while describing the image content semantically accurately. In this paper, we propose a novel stylized image captioning model that effectively takes both requirements into consideration. To this end, we first devise a new variant of LSTM, named style-factual LSTM, as the building block of our model. It uses two groups of matrices to capture the factual and stylized knowledge, respectively, and automatically learns the word-level weights of the two groups based on previous context. In addition, when we train the model to capture stylized elements, we propose an adaptive learning approach based on a reference factual model, it provides factual knowledge to the model as the model learns from stylized caption labels, and can adaptively compute how much information to supply at each time step. We evaluate our model on two stylized image captioning datasets, which contain humorous/romantic captions and positive/negative captions, respectively. Experiments shows that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, without using extra ground truth supervision.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tianlang_Chen_Factual_or_Emotional_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tianlang Chen, Zhongping Zhang, Quanzeng You, Chen Fang, Zhaowen Wang, Hailin Jin, Jiebo Luo
Diverse feature visualizations reveal invariances in early layers of deep neural networks	Visualizing features in deep neural networks (DNNs) can help understanding their computations. Many previous studies aimed to visualize the selectivity of individual units by finding meaningful images that maximize their activation. However, comparably little attention has been paid to visualizing to what image transformations units in DNNs are invariant. Here we propose a method to discover invariances in the responses of hidden layer units of deep neural networks. Our approach is based on simultaneously searching for a batch of images that strongly activate a unit while at the same time being as distinct from each other as possible. We find that even early convolutional layers in VGG-19 exhibit various forms of response invariance: near-perfect phase invariance in some units and invariance to local diffeomorphic transformations in others. At the same time, we uncover representational differences with ResNet-50 in its corresponding layers. We conclude that invariance transformations are a major computational component learned by DNNs and we provide a systematic method to study them.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Santiago_Cadena_Diverse_feature_visualizations_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Santiago A.

Multimodal Unsupervised Image-to-image Translation	Unsupervised image-to-image translation is an important and challenging problem in computer vision. Given an image in the source domain, the goal is to learn the conditional distribution of corresponding images in the target domain, without seeing any pairs of corresponding images. While this conditional distribution is inherently multimodal, existing approaches make an overly simplified assumption, modeling it as a deterministic one-to-one mapping. As a result, they fail to generate diverse outputs from a given source domain image. To address this limitation, we propose a Multimodal Unsupervised Image-to-image Translation (MUNIT) framework. We assume that the image representation can be decomposed into a content code that is domain-invariant, and a style code that captures domain-specific properties. To translate an image to another domain, we recombine its content code with a random style code sampled from the style space of the target domain. We analyze the proposed framework and establish several theoretical results. Extensive experiments with comparisons to the state-of-the-art approaches further demonstrates the advantage of the proposed framework. Moreover, our framework allows users to control the style of translation outputs by providing an example style image.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xun_Huang_Multimodal_Unsupervised_Image-to-image_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xun Huang, Ming-Yu Liu, Serge Belongie, Jan Kautz
Salient Objects in Clutter: Bringing Salient Object Detection to the Foreground	We provide a comprehensive evaluation of salient object detection (SOD) models. Our analysis identifies a serious design bias of existing SOD datasets which assumes that each image contains at least one clearly outstanding salient object in low clutter. The design bias has led to a saturated high performance for state-of-the-art SOD models when evaluated on existing datasets. The models, however, still perform far from being satisfactory when applied to real-world daily scenes. Based on our analyses, we rst identify 7 crucial aspects that a comprehensive and balanced dataset should fulll. Then, we propose a new high-quality dataset and update the previous saliency benchmark. Specically, our SOC (Salient Objects in Clutter) dataset, includes images with salient and non-salient objects from daily object categories. Beyond object category annotations, each salient image is accompanied by attributes that reflect common challenges in real-world scenes. Finally, we report attribute-based performance assessment on our dataset.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Deng-Ping_Fan_Salient_Objects_in_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Deng-Ping Fan, Ming-Ming Cheng, Jiang-Jiang Liu, Shang-Hua Gao, Qibin Hou, Ali Borji
Joint 3D Face Reconstruction and Dense Alignment with Position Map Regression Network	We propose a straightforward method that simultaneously reconstructs the 3D facial structure and provides dense alignment. To achieve this, we design a 2D representation called UV position map which records the 3D shape of a complete face in UV space, then train a simple Convolutional Neural Network to regress it from a single 2D image. We also integrate a weight mask into the loss function during training to improve the performance of the network. Our method does not rely on any prior face model, and can reconstruct full facial geometry along with semantic meaning. Meanwhile, our network is very light-weighted and spends only 9.8ms to process an image, which is extremely faster than previous works. Experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method surpasses other state-of-the-art methods on both reconstruction and alignment tasks by a large margin. Code is available at https://github.com/YadiraF/PRNet.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yao_Feng_Joint_3D_Face_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yao Feng, Fan Wu, Xiaohu Shao, Yanfeng Wang, Xi Zhou
Acquisition of Localization Confidence for Accurate Object Detection	Modern CNN-based object detectors rely on bounding box regression and non-maximum suppression to localize objects. While the probabilities for class labels naturally reflect classification confidence, localization confidence is absent. This makes properly localized bounding boxes degenerate during iterative regression or even suppressed during NMS. In the paper we propose IoU-Net learning to predict the IoU between each detected bounding box and the matched ground-truth. The network acquires this confidence of localization, which improves the NMS procedure by preserving accurately localized bounding boxes. Furthermore, an optimization-based bounding box refinement method is proposed, where the predicted IoU is formulated as the objective. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO dataset show the effectiveness of IoU-Net, as well as its compatibility with and adaptivity to several state-of-the-art object detectors.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Borui_Jiang_Acquisition_of_Localization_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Borui Jiang, Ruixuan Luo, Jiayuan Mao, Tete Xiao, Yuning Jiang
Recurrent Squeeze-and-Excitation Context Aggregation Net for Single Image Deraining	Rain streaks can severely degrade the visibility, which causes many current computer vision algorithms fail to work. So it is necessary to remove the rain from images. We propose a novel deep network architecture based on deep convolutional and recurrent neural networks for single image deraining. As contextual information is very important for rain removal, we first adopt the dilated convolutional neural network to acquire large receptive field. To better fit the rain removal task, we also modify the network. In heavy rain, rain streaks have various directions and shapes, which can be regarded as the accumulation of multiple rain streak layers. We assign different alpha-values to various rain streak layers according to the intensity and transparency by incorporating the squeeze-and-excitation block. Since rain streak layers overlap with each other, it is not easy to remove the rain in one stage. So we further decompose the rain removal into multiple stages. Recurrent neural network is incorporated to preserve the useful information in previous stages and benefit the rain removal in later stages. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches under all evaluation metrics.method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches under all evaluation metrics.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xia_Li_Recurrent_Squeeze-and-Excitation_Context_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xia Li, Jianlong Wu, Zhouchen Lin, Hong Liu, Hongbin Zha
A Style-Aware Content Loss for Real-time HD Style Transfer	Recently style transfer has received a lot of attention. While much of this research has aimed at speeding up the processing, the approaches are still lacking from a principled, art historical standpoint: a style is more than just a single image or an artist, but previous work is limited to only a single instance of a style or shows no benefit from more images. Moreover, previous work has relied on a direct comparison of art in the domain of RGB images or on CNNs pre-trained on ImageNet, which requires millions of labeled object bounding boxes and can introduce an extra bias, since it has been assembled without artistic consideration. To circumvent these issues, we propose a style-aware content loss, which is trained jointly with a deep encoder-decoder network for real-time, high-resolution stylization of images and videos. We propose a quantitative measure for evaluating the quality of a stylized image and also have art historians rank patches from our approach against those from previous work. These and our qualitative results ranging from small image patches to megapixel stylistic images and videos show that our approach better captures the subtle nature in which a style affects content.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Artsiom_Sanakoyeu_A_Style-aware_Content_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Artsiom Sanakoyeu, Dmytro Kotovenko, Sabine Lang, Bjorn Ommer
Object-centered image stitching	Image stitching is typically decomposed into three phases: registration, which aligns the source images with a common target image; seam finding, which determines for each target pixel the source image it should come from; and blending, which smooths transitions over the seams. As described in Szeliski's tutorial on image stitching, the seam finding phase attempts to place seams between pixels where the transition between source images is not noticeable. Here, we observe that the most problematic failures of this approach occur when objects are cropped, omitted, or duplicated. We therefore take an object-centered approach to the problem, leveraging recent advances in object detection. We penalize candidate solutions with this class of error by modifying the energy function used in the seam finding stage. This produces substantially more realistic stitching results on challenging imagery. In addition, these methods can be used to determine when there is non-recoverable occlusion in the input data, and also suggest a simple evaluation metric that can be used to evaluate the output of stitching algorithms.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Charles_Herrmann_Object-centered_image_stitching_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Charles Herrmann, Chen Wang, Richard Strong Bowen, Emil Keyder, Ramin Zabih
Deep Feature Factorization For Concept Discovery	We propose Deep Feature Factorization (DFF), a method capable of localizing similar semantic concepts within an image or a set of images. We use DFF to gain insight into a deep convolutional neural network's learned features, where we detect hierarchical cluster structures in feature space. This is visualized as heat maps, which highlight semantically matching regions across a set of images, revealing what the network `perceives' as similar. DFF can also be used to perform co-segmentation and co-localization, and we report state-of-the-art results on these tasks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Edo_Collins_Deep_Feature_Factorization_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Edo Collins, Radhakrishna Achanta, Sabine Susstrunk
Scale Aggregation Network for Accurate and Efficient Crowd Counting	In this paper, we propose a novel encoder-decoder network, called extit{Scale Aggregation Network (SANet)}, for accurate and efficient crowd counting. The encoder extracts multi-scale features with scale aggregation modules and the decoder generates high-resolution density maps by using a set of transposed convolutions. Moreover, we find that most existing works use only Euclidean loss which assumes independence among each pixel but ignores the local correlation in density maps. Therefore, we propose a novel training loss, combining of Euclidean loss and local pattern consistency loss, which improves the performance of the model in our experiments. In addition, we use normalization layers to ease the training process and apply a patch-based test scheme to reduce the impact of statistic shift problem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on four major crowd counting datasets and our method achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods while with much less parameters.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xinkun_Cao_Scale_Aggregation_Network_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xinkun Cao, Zhipeng Wang, Yanyun Zhao, Fei Su
Robust Optical Flow in Rainy Scenes	Optical flow estimation in rainy scenes is challenging due to degradation caused by rain streaks and rain accumulation, where the latter refers to the poor visibility of remote scenes due to intense rainfall. To resolve the problem, we introduce a residue channel, a single channel (gray) image that is free from rain, and its colored version, a colored-residue image. We propose to utilize these two rain-free images in computing optical flow. To deal with the loss of contrast and the attendant sensitivity to noise, we decompose each of the input images into a piecewise-smooth structure layer and a high-frequency fine-detail texture layer. We combine the colored-residue images and structure layers in a unified objective function, so that the estimation of optical flow can be more robust. Results on both synthetic and real images show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods on different types of rain sequences. To our knowledge, this is the first optical flow method specifically dealing with rain. We also provide an optical flow dataset consisting of both synthetic and real rain images.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ruoteng_Li_Robust_Optical_Flow_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ruoteng Li, Robby T.

StereoNet: Guided Hierarchical Refinement for Real-Time Edge-Aware Depth Prediction	This paper presents StereoNet, the first end-to-end deep architecture for real-time stereo matching that runs at 60 fps on an NVidia Titan X, producing high-quality, edge-preserved, quantization-free depth maps. A key insight of this paper is that the network achieves a sub-pixel matching precision than is a magnitude higher than those of traditional stereo matching approaches. This allows us to achieve real-time performance by using a very low resolution cost volume that encodes all the information needed to achieve high depth precision. Spatial precision is achieved by employing a learned edge-aware upsampling function. Our model uses a Siamese network to extract features from the left and right image. A first estimate of the disparity is computed in a very low resolution cost volume, then hierarchically the model re-introduces high-frequency details through a learned upsampling function that uses compact pixel-to-pixel refinement networks. Leveraging color input as a guide, this function is capable of producing high-quality edge-aware output. We achieve compelling results on multiple benchmarks, showing how the proposed method offers extreme flexibility at an acceptable computational budget.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Sameh_Khamis_StereoNet_Guided_Hierarchical_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Sameh Khamis, Sean Fanello, Christoph Rhemann, Adarsh Kowdle, Julien Valentin, Shahram Izadi
Lambda Twist: An Accurate Fast Robust Perspective Three Point (P3P) Solver	We present Lambda Twist; a novel P3P solver which is accurate, fast and robust. Current state-of-the-art P3P solvers find all roots to a quartic and discard geometrically invalid and duplicate solutions in a post-processing step. Instead of solving a quartic, the proposed P3P solver exploits the underlying elliptic equations which can be solved by a fast and numerically accurate diagonalization. This diagonalization requires a single real root of a cubic which is then used to find the, up to four, P3P solutions. Unlike the direct quartic solvers our method never computes geometrically invalid or duplicate solutions. Extensive evaluation on synthetic data shows that the new solver has better numerical accuracy and is faster compared to the state-of-the-art P3P implementations. Implementation and benchmark are available on github.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Mikael_Persson_Lambda_Twist_An_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Mikael Persson, Klas Nordberg
Joint Representation and Truncated Inference Learning for Correlation Filter based Tracking	Correlation filter (CF) based trackers generally include two modules, i.e., feature representation and on-line model adaptation. In existing off-line deep learning models for CF trackers, the model adaptation usually is either abandoned or has closed-form solution to make it feasible to learn deep representation in an end-to-end manner. However, such solutions fail to exploit the advances in CF models, and cannot achieve competitive accuracy in comparison with the state-of-the-art CF trackers. In this paper, we investigate the joint learning of deep representation and model adaptation, where an updater network is introduced for better tracking on future frame by taking current frame representation, tracking result, and last CF tracker as input. By modeling the representor as convolutional neural network (CNN), we truncate the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and interpret it as a deep network of updater, resulting in our model for learning representation and truncated inference (RTINet). Experiments demonstrate that our RTINet tracker achieves favorable tracking accuracy against the state-of-the-art trackers and its rapid version can run at a real-time speed of 24 fps. The code and pre-trained model will be publicly available.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yingjie_Yao_Joint_Representation_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yingjie Yao, Xiaohe Wu, Lei Zhang, Shiguang Shan, Wangmeng Zuo
Attention-GAN for Object Transfiguration in Wild Images	This paper studies the object transfiguration problem in wild images. The generative network in classical GANs for object transfiguration often undertakes a dual responsibility: to detect the objects of interests and to convert the object from source domain to another domain. In contrast, we decompose the generative network into two separated networks, each of which is only dedicated to one particular sub-task. The attention network predicts spatial attention maps of images, and the transformation network focuses on translating objects. Attention maps produced by attention network are encouraged to be sparse, so that major attention can be paid on objects of interests. No matter before or after object transfiguration, attention maps should remain constant. In addition, learning attention network can receive more instruction, given the available segmentation annotations of images. Experimental results demonstrate the necessity of investigating attention in object transfiguration, and that the proposed algorithm can learn accurate attention to improve quality of generated images.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xinyuan_Chen_Attention-GAN_for_Object_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xinyuan Chen, Chang Xu, Xiaokang Yang, Dacheng Tao
ShuffleNet V2: Practical Guidelines for Efficient CNN Architecture Design	Current network architecture design is mostly guided by the indirect metric of computation complexity, i.e., FLOPs. However, the direct metric, such as speed, also depends on the other factors such as memory access cost and platform characterics. Taking these factors into account, this work proposes practical guidelines for efficient network de- sign. Accordingly, a new architecture called ShuffleNet V2 is presented. Comprehensive experiments verify that it is the state-of-the-art in both speed and accuracy.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ningning_Light-weight_CNN_Architecture_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ningning Ma, Xiangyu Zhang, Hai-Tao Zheng, Jian Sun
Structure-from-Motion-Aware PatchMatch for Adaptive Optical Flow Estimation	Many recent energy-based methods for optical flow estimation rely on a good initialization that is typically provided by some kind of feature matching. So far, however, these initial matching approaches are rather general: They do not incorporate any additional information that could help to improve the accuracy or the robustness of the estimation. In particular, they do not exploit potential cues on the camera poses and the thereby induced rigid motion of the scene. In the present paper, we tackle this problem. To this end, we propose a novel structure-from-motion-aware PatchMatch approach that, in contrast to existing matching techniques, combines two hierarchical feature matching methods: a recent two-frame PatchMatch approach for optical flow estimation (general motion) and a specifically tailored three-frame PatchMatch approach for rigid scene reconstruction (SfM). While the motion PatchMatch serves as baseline with good accuracy, the SfM counterpart takes over at occlusions and other regions with insufficient information. Experiments with our novel SfM-aware PatchMatch approach demonstrate its usefulness. They not only show excellent results for all major benchmarks (KITTI 2012/2015, MPI Sintel), but also improvements up to 50 percent compared to a PatchMatch approach without structure information.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Daniel_Maurer_Structure-from-Motion-Aware_PatchMatch_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Daniel Maurer, Nico Marniok, Bastian Goldluecke, Andres Bruhn
Look Before You Leap: Bridging Model-Free and Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Planned-Ahead Vision-and-Language Navigation	Existing research studies on vision and language grounding for robot navigation focus on improving model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models in synthetic environments. However, model-free DRL models do not consider the dynamics in the real-world environments, and they often fail to generalize to new scenes. In this paper, we take a radical approach to bridge the gap between synthetic studies and real-world practices---We propose a novel, planned-ahead hybrid reinforcement learning model that combines model-free and model-based reinforcement learning to solve a real-world vision-language navigation task. Our look-ahead module tightly integrates a look-ahead policy model with an environment model that predicts the next state and the reward. Experimental results suggest that our proposed method significantly outperforms the baselines and achieves the best on the real-world Room-to-Room dataset. Moreover, our scalable method is more generalizable when transferring to unseen environments.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xin_Wang_Look_Before_You_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xin Wang, Wenhan Xiong, Hongmin Wang, William Yang Wang
Audio-Visual Scene Analysis with Self-Supervised Multisensory Features	The thud of a bouncing ball, the onset of speech as lips open -- when visual and audio events occur together, it suggests that there might be a common, underlying event that produced both signals. In this paper, we argue that the visual and audio components of a video signal should be modeled jointly using a fused multisensory representation. We propose to learn such a representation in a self-supervised way, by training a neural network to predict whether video frames and audio are temporally aligned. We use this learned representation for three applications: (a) sound source localization, i.e. visualizing the source of sound in a video; (b) audio-visual action recognition; and (c) on/off-screen audio source separation, e.g. removing the off-screen translator's voice from a foreign official's speech. Code, models, and video results are available on our webpage: http://andrewowens.com/multisensory.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Andrew_Owens_Audio-Visual_Scene_Analysis_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Andrew Owens, Alexei A.

Extreme Network Compression via Filter Group Approximation	In this paper we propose a novel decomposition method based on filter group approximation, which can significantly reduce the redundancy of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) while maintaining the majority of feature representation. Unlike other low-rank decomposition algorithms which operate on spatial or channel dimension of filters, our proposed method mainly focuses on exploiting the filter group structure for each layer. For several commonly used CNN models, including VGG and ResNet, our method can reduce over 80% floating-point operations (FLOPs) with less accuracy drop than state-of-the-art methods on various image classification datasets. Besides, experiments demonstrate that our method is conducive to alleviating degeneracy of the compressed network, which hurts the convergence and performance of the network.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Bo_Peng_Extreme_Network_Compression_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Bo Peng, Wenming Tan, Zheyang Li, Shun Zhang, Di Xie, Shiliang Pu
Compositing-aware Image Search	We present a new image search technique that, given a background image, returns compatible foreground objects for image compositing tasks. The compatibility of a foreground object and a background scene depends on various aspects such as semantics, surrounding context, geometry, style and color. However, existing image search techniques measure the similarities on only a few aspects, and may return many results that are not suitable for compositing. Moreover, the importance of each factor may vary for different object categories and image content, making it difficult to manually define the matching criteria. In this paper, we propose to learn feature representations for foreground objects and background scenes respectively, where image content and object category information are jointly encoded during training. As a result, the learned features can adaptively encode the most important compatibility factors. We project the features to a common embedding space, so that the compatibility scores can be easily measured using the cosine similarity, enabling very efficient search. We collect an evaluation set consisting of eight object categories commonly used in compositing tasks, on which we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms other search techniques.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hengshuang_Zhao_Compositing-aware_Image_Search_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hengshuang Zhao, Xiaohui Shen, Zhe Lin, Kalyan Sunkavalli, Brian Price, Jiaya Jia
A New Large Scale Dynamic Texture Dataset with Application to ConvNet Understanding	This paper introduces a new large scale dynamic texture dataset. The dataset is provided with two complementary organizations, one based on dynamics independent of spatial appearance and one based on spatial appearance independent of dynamics. With over 10,000 videos, the proposed Dynamic Texture DataBase (DTDB) is two orders of magnitude larger than any previously available dynamic texture dataset. The complementary organizations of the dataset allow for uniquely insightful experiments regarding the abilities of major classes of spatiotemporal ConvNet architectures to exploit appearance vs. dynamic information. We also present a novel two-stream ConvNet that provides an alterna- tive to the standard optical-flow-based motion stream to broaden the range of dynamic patterns that can be encompassed. The resulting motion stream is shown to outperform the traditional optical flow stream by considerable margins. Finally, the utility of the dataset as a pre-training substrate is demonstrated via transfer learning experiments with a different dynamic texture dataset as well as the companion task of dynamic scene recognition resulting in a new state-of-the-art.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Isma_Hadji_A_New_Large_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Isma Hadji, Richard P.

Joint Task-Recursive Learning for Semantic Segmentation and Depth Estimation	In this paper, we propose a novel joint Task-Recursive Learning (TRL) framework for the closing-loop semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation tasks. TRL can recursively refine the results of both tasks through serialized task-level interactions. In order to mutually-boost for each other, we encapsulate the interaction into a specific Task-Attentional Module (TAM) to adaptively enhance some counterpart patterns of both tasks. Further, to make the inference more credible, we propagate previous learning experiences on both tasks into the next network evolution by explicitly concatenating previous responses. The sequence of task-level interactions are finally evolved along a coarse-to-fine scale space such that the required details may be reconstructed progressively. Extensive experiments on NYU-Depth v2 and SUN RGB-D datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results for monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhenyu_Zhang_Joint_Task-Recursive_Learning_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhenyu Zhang, Zhen Cui, Chunyan Xu, Zequn Jie, Xiang Li, Jian Yang
Holistic 3D Scene Parsing and Reconstruction from a Single RGB Image	We propose a computational framework to jointly parse a single RGB image and reconstruct a holistic 3D configuration composed by a set of CAD models using a stochastic grammar model. Specifically, we introduce a Holistic Scene Grammar (HSG) to represent the 3D scene structure, which characterizes a joint distribution over the functional and geometric space of indoor scenes. The proposed HSG captures three essential and often latent dimensions of the indoor scenes: i) latent human context, describing the affordance and the functionality of a room arrangement, ii) geometric constraints over the scene configurations, and iii) physical constraints that guarantee physically plausible parsing and reconstruction. We solve this joint parsing and reconstruction problem in an analysis-by-synthesis fashion, seeking to minimize the differences between the input image and the rendered images generated by our 3D representation, over the space of depth, surface normal, and object segmentation map. The optimal configuration, represented by a parse graph, is inferred using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which efficiently traverses through the non-differentiable solution space, jointly optimizing object localization, 3D layout, and hidden human context. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the generalization ability and significantly outperforms prior methods on 3D layout estimation, 3D object detection, and holistic scene understanding.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Siyuan_Huang_Monocular_Scene_Parsing_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Siyuan Huang, Siyuan Qi, Yixin Zhu, Yinxue Xiao, Yuanlu Xu, Song-Chun Zhu
Folded Recurrent Neural Networks for Future Video Prediction	This work introduces double-mapping Gated Recurrent Units (dGRU), an extension of standard GRUs where the input is considered as a recurrent state. An extra set of logic gates is added to update the input given the output. Stacking multiple such layers results in a recurrent auto-encoder: the operators updating the outputs comprise the encoder, while the ones updating the inputs form the decoder. Since the states are shared between corresponding encoder and decoder layers, the representation is stratified during learning: some information is not passed to the next layers. We test our model on future video prediction. Main challenges for this task include high variability in videos, temporal propagation of errors, and non-specificity of future frames. We show how only the encoder or decoder needs to be applied for encoding or prediction. This reduces the computational cost and avoids re-encoding predictions when generating multiple frames, mitigating error propagation. Furthermore, it is possible to remove layers from a trained model, giving an insight to the role of each layer. Our approach improves state of the art results on MMNIST and UCF101, being competitive on KTH with 2 and 3 times less memory usage and computational cost than the best scored approach.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Marc_Oliu_Folded_Recurrent_Neural_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Marc Oliu, Javier Selva, Sergio Escalera
Estimating Depth from RGB and Sparse Sensing	We present a deep model that can accurately produce dense depth maps given an RGB image with known depth at a very sparse set of pixels. The model works *simultaneously* for both indoor/outdoor scenes and produces state-of-the-art dense depth maps at nearly real-time speeds on both the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets. We surpass the state-of-the-art for monocular depth estimation even with depth values for only 1 out of every ~10000 image pixels, and we outperform other sparse-to-dense depth methods at all sparsity levels. With depth values for 1/256 of the image pixels, we achieve a mean error of less than 1% of actual depth on indoor scenes, comparable to the performance of consumer-grade depth sensor hardware. Our experiments demonstrate that it would indeed be possible to efficiently transform sparse depth measurements obtained using e.g. lower-power depth sensors or SLAM systems into high-quality dense depth maps.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhao_Chen_Estimating_Depth_from_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhao Chen, Vijay Badrinarayanan, Gilad Drozdov, Andrew Rabinovich
Recurrent Tubelet Proposal and Recognition Networks for Action Detection	Detecting actions in videos is a challenging task as video is an information intensive media with complex variations. Existing approaches predominantly generate action proposals for each individual frame or fixed-length clip independently, while overlooking temporal context across them. Such temporal contextual relations are vital for action detection as an action is by nature a sequence of movements. This motivates us to leverage the localized action proposals in previous frames when determining action regions in the current one. Specifically, we present a novel deep architecture called Recurrent Tubelet Proposal and Recognition (RTPR) networks to incorporate temporal context for action detection. The proposed RTPR consists of two correlated networks, i.e., Recurrent Tubelet Proposal (RTP) networks and Recurrent Tubelet Recognition (RTR) networks. The RTP initializes action proposals of the start frame through a Region Proposal Network and then estimates the movements of proposals in next frame in a recurrent manner. The action proposals of different frames are linked to form the tubelet proposals. The RTR capitalizes on a multi-channel architecture, where in each channel, a tubelet proposal is fed into a CNN plus LSTM to recurrently recognize action in the tubelet. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and demonstrate superior results over state-of-the-art methods. More remarkably, we obtain mAP of 98.6%, 81.3%, 77.9% and 22.3% with gains of 2.9%, 4.3%, 0.7% and 3.9% over the best competitors on UCF-Sports, J-HMDB, UCF-101 and AVA, respectively.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Dong_Li_Recurrent_Tubelet_Proposal_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Dong Li, Zhaofan Qiu, Qi Dai, Ting Yao, Tao Mei
Mancs: A Multi-task Attentional Network with Curriculum Sampling for Person Re-identification	We propose a novel deep network called Mancs that solves the person re-identification problem from the following aspects: fully utilizing the attention mechanism for the person misalignment problem and properly sampling for the ranking loss to obtain more stable person representation. Technically, we contribute a novel fully attentional block which is deeply supervised and can be plugged into any CNN, and a novel curriculum sampling method which is effective for training ranking losses. The learning tasks are integrated into a unified framework and jointly optimized. Experiments have been carried out on Market1501, CUHK03 and DukeMTMC. All the results show that Mancs can significantly outperform the previous state-of-the-arts. In addition, the effectiveness of the newly proposed ideas has been confirmed by extensive ablation studies.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Cheng_Wang_Mancs_A_Multi-task_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Cheng Wang, Qian Zhang, Chang Huang, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang
RelocNet: Continuous Metric Learning Relocalisation using Neural Nets	We propose a method of learning suitable convolutional representations for camera pose retrieval based on nearest neighbour matching and continuous metric learning-based feature descriptors. We introduce information from camera frusta overlaps between pairs of images to optimise our feature embedding network. Thus, the final camera pose descriptor differences represent camera pose changes. In addition, we build a pose regressor that is trained with a geometric loss to infer finer relative poses between a query and nearest neighbour images. Experiments show that our method is able to generalise in a meaningful way, and outperforms related methods across several experiments.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Vassileios_Balntas_RelocNet_Continous_Metric_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Vassileios Balntas, Shuda Li, Victor Prisacariu
Improving DNN Robustness to Adversarial Attacks using Jacobian Regularization	Deep neural networks have lately shown tremendous performance in various applications including vision and speech processing tasks. However, alongside their ability to perform these tasks with such high accuracy, it has been shown that they are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks: a small change in the input would cause the network to err with high confidence. This phenomenon exposes an inherent fault in these networks and their ability to generalize well. For this reason, providing robustness to adversarial attacks is an important challenge in networks training, which has led to extensive research. In this work, we suggest a theoretically inspired novel approach to improve the networks' robustness. Our method applies regularization using the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian of the network, which is applied as post-processing, after regular training has finished. We demonstrate empirically that it leads to enhanced robustness results with a minimal change in the original network's accuracy.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Daniel_Jakubovitz_Improving_DNN_Robustness_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Daniel Jakubovitz, Raja Giryes
StarMap for Category-Agnostic Keypoint and Viewpoint Estimation	Semantic keypoints provide concise abstractions for a variety of visual understanding tasks. Existing methods define semantic keypoints separately for each category with a fixed number of semantic labels in fixed indices. As a result, this keypoint representation is in-feasible when objects have a varying number of parts, e.g. chairs with varying number of legs. We propose a category-agnostic keypoint representation, which combines a multi-peak heatmap (StarMap) for all the keypoints and their corresponding features as 3D locations in the canonical viewpoint (CanViewFeature) defined for each instance. Our intuition is that the 3D locations of the keypoints in canonical object views contain rich semantic and compositional information. Using our flexible representation, we demonstrate competitive performance in keypoint detection and localization compared to category-specific state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we show that when augmented with an additional depth channel (DepthMap) to lift the 2D keypoints to 3D, our representation can achieve state-of-the-art results in viewpoint estimation. Finally, we show that our category-agnostic keypoint representation can be generalized to novel categories.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xingyi_Zhou_Category-Agnostic_Semantic_Keypoint_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xingyi Zhou, Arjun Karpur, Linjie Luo, Qixing Huang
Cross-Modal and Hierarchical Modeling of Video and Text	Visual data and text data are composed of information at multiple granularities. A video can describe a complex scene that is composed of multiple clips or shots, where each depicts a semantically coherent event or action. Similarly, a paragraph may contain sentences with different topics, which collectively conveys a coherent message or story. In this paper, we investigate the modeling techniques for such hierarchical sequential data where there are correspondences across multiple modalities. Specifically, we introduce hierarchical sequence embedding (HSE), a generic model for embedding sequential data of different modalities into hierarchically semantic spaces, with either explicit or implicit correspondence information. We perform empirical studies on large-scale video and paragraph retrieval datasets and demonstrated superior performance by the proposed methods. Furthermore, we examine the effectiveness of our learned embeddings when applied to downstream tasks. We show its utility in zero-shot action recognition and video captioning.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Bowen_Zhang_Cross-Modal_and_Hierarchical_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Bowen Zhang, Hexiang Hu, Fei Sha
Hard-Aware Point-to-Set Deep Metric for Person Re-identification	Person re-identification (re-ID) is a highly challenging task due to large variations of pose, viewpoint, illumination, and occlusion. Deep metric learning provides a satisfactory solution to person re-ID by training a deep network under supervision of metric loss, e.g., triplet loss. However, the performance of deep metric learning is greatly limited by traditional sampling methods. To solve this problem, we propose a Hard-Aware Point-to-Set (HAP2S) loss with a soft hard-mining scheme. Based on the point-to-set triplet loss framework, the HAP2S loss adaptively assigns greater weights to harder samples. Several advantageous properties are observed when compared with other state-of-the-art loss functions: 1) Accuracy: HAP2S loss consistently achieves higher re-ID accuracies than other alternatives on three large-scale benchmark datasets; 2) Robustness: HAP2S loss is more robust to outliers than other losses; 3) Flexibility: HAP2S loss does not rely on a specific weight function, i.e., different instantiations of HAP2S loss are equally effective. 4) Generality: In addition to person re-ID, we apply the proposed method to generic deep metric learning benchmarks including CUB-200-2011 and Cars196, and also achieve state-of-the-art results.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Rui_Yu_Hard-Aware_Point-to-Set_Deep_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Rui Yu, Zhiyong Dou, Song Bai, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Yongchao Xu, Xiang Bai
Separating Reflection and Transmission Images in the Wild	The reflections caused by common semi-reflectors, such as glass windows, can impact the performance of computer vision algorithms. State-of-the-art methods can remove reflections on synthetic data and in controlled scenarios. However, they are based on strong assumptions and do not generalize well to real-world images. Contrary to a common misconception, real-world images are challenging even when polarization information is used. We present a deep learning approach to separate the reflected and the transmitted components of the recorded irradiance, which explicitly uses the polarization properties of light. To train it, we introduce an accurate synthetic data generation pipeline, which simulates realistic reflections, including those generated by curved and non-ideal surfaces, non-static scenes, and high-dynamic-range scenes.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Patrick_Wieschollek_Separating_Reflection_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Patrick Wieschollek, Orazio Gallo, Jinwei Gu, Jan Kautz
Ask, Acquire, and Attack: Data-free UAP Generation using Class Impressions	Deep learning models are susceptible to input specific noise, called adversarial perturbations. Moreover, there exist input-agnostic noise, called Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP) that can affect inference of the models over most input samples. Given a model, there exist broadly two approaches to craft UAPs: (i) data-driven: that require data, and (ii) data-free: that do not require data samples. Data-driven approaches require actual samples from the underlying data distribution and craft UAPs with high success (fooling) rate. However, data-free approaches craft UAPs without utilizing any data samples and therefore result in lesser success rates. In this paper, for data-free scenarios, we propose a novel approach that emulates the effect of data samples with class impressions in order to craft UAPs using data-driven objectives. Class impression for a given pair of category and model is a generic representation (in the input space) of the samples belonging to that category. Further, we present a neural network based generative model that utilizes the acquired class impressions to learn crafting UAPs. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the learned generative model, (i) readily crafts UAPs via simple feed-forwarding through neural network layers, and (ii) achieves state-of-the-art success rates for data-free scenario and closer to that for data-driven setting without actually utilizing any data samples.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Konda_Reddy_Mopuri_Ask_Acquire_and_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Konda Reddy Mopuri, Phani Krishna Uppala, R.

Towards End-to-End License Plate Detection and Recognition: A Large Dataset and Baseline	Most current license plate (LP) detection and recognition approaches are evaluated on a small and usually unrepresentative dataset since there are no publicly available large diverse datasets. In this paper, we introduce CCPD, a large and comprehensive LP dataset. All images are taken manually by workers of a roadside parking management company and are annotated carefully. To our best knowledge, CCPD is the largest publicly available LP dataset to date with over 250k unique car images, and the only one provides vertices location annotations. With CCPD, we present a novel network model which can predict the bounding box and recognize the corresponding LP number simultaneously with high speed and accuracy. Through comparative experiments, we demonstrate our model outperforms current object detection and recognition approaches in both accuracy and speed. In real-world applications, our model recognizes LP numbers directly from relatively high-resolution images at over 61 fps and 98.5% accuracy.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhenbo_Xu_Towards_End-to-End_License_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhenbo Xu, Wei Yang, Ajin Meng, Nanxue Lu, Huan Huang, Changchun Ying, Liusheng Huang
Supervising the new with the old: learning SFM from SFM	Recent work has demonstrated that it is possible to learn deep neural networks for monocular depth and ego-motion estimation from unlabelled video sequences, an interesting theoretical development with numerous advantages in applications. In this paper, we propose a number of improvements to these approaches. First, since such self-supervised approaches are based on the brightness constancy assumption, which is valid only for a subset of pixels, we propose a probabilistic learning formulation where the network predicts distributions over variables rather than specific values. As these distributions are conditioned on the observed image, the network can learn which scene and object types are likely to violate the model assumptions, resulting in more robust learning. We also propose to build on dozens of years of experience in developing handcrafted structure-from-motion (SFM) algorithms. We do so by using an off-the-shelf SFM system to generate a supervisory signal for the deep neural network. While this signal is also noisy, we show that our probabilistic formulation can learn and account for the defects of SFM, helping to integrate different sources of information and boosting the overall performance of the network.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Maria_Klodt_Supervising_the_new_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Maria Klodt, Andrea Vedaldi
Product Quantization Network for Fast Image Retrieval	Product quantization has been widely used in fast image retrieval due to its effectiveness of coding high-dimensional visual features. By extending the hard assignment to soft assignment, we make it feasible to incorporate the product quantization as a layer of a convolutional neural network and propose our product quantization network. Meanwhile, we come up with a novel asymmetric triplet loss, which effectively boosts the retrieval accuracy of the proposed product quantization network based on asymmetric similarity. Through the proposed product quantization network, we can obtain a discriminative and compact image representation in an end-to-end manner, which further enables a fast and accurate image retrieval. Comprehensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed product quantization network.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Tan_Yu_Product_Quantization_Network_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Tan Yu, Junsong Yuan, Chen Fang, Hailin Jin
Task-Aware Image Downscaling	Image downscaling is one of the most classical problems in computer vision that aims to preserve the visual appearance of the original image when it is resized to a smaller scale. Upscaling a small image back to its original size is a difficult, ill-posed problem due to information loss that arises in the downscaling process. In this paper, we present a novel operation called task-aware image downscaling to support an upscaling task. We propose an auto-encoder-based framework that enables joint learning of the downscaling network and the upscaling network to maximize the restoration performance. Our framework is efficient, and it can be generalized to handle an arbitrary image resizing operation. Experimental results show that our task-aware downscaled image, greatly improved the super-resolution performance of the previous state-of-the-art. In addition, realistic images can be recovered by recursively applying our scaling model up to an extreme scaling factor of x128. We validate our model's generalization capability by applying it to the task of image colorization.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Heewon_Kim_Task-Aware_Image_Downscaling_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Heewon Kim, Myungsub Choi, Bee Lim, Kyoung Mu Lee
Tracking Emerges by Colorizing Videos	We use large amounts of unlabeled video to learn models for visual tracking without manual human supervision. We leverage the natural temporal coherency of color to create a model that learns to colorize gray-scale videos by copying colors from a reference frame. Quantitative and qualitative experiments suggest that this task causes the model to automatically learn to track visual regions. Although the model is trained without any ground-truth labels, our method learns to track well enough to outperform the latest methods based on optical flow. Moreover, our results suggest that failures to track are correlated with failures to colorize, indicating that advancing video colorization may further improve self-supervised visual tracking.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Carl_Vondrick_Self-supervised_Tracking_by_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Carl Vondrick, Abhinav Shrivastava, Alireza Fathi, Sergio Guadarrama, Kevin Murphy
Retrospective Encoders for Video Summarization	Supervised learning techniques have shown substantial progress on video summarization. State-of-the-art approaches mostly regard the predicted summary and the human summary as two sequences (sets), and minimize discriminative losses that measure element-wise discrepancy. Such training objectives do not explicitly model how well the predicted summary preserves semantic information in the video. Moreover, those methods often demand a large amount of human generated summaries. In this paper, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence learning model to address these deficiencies. The key idea is to complement the discriminative losses with another loss which measures if the predicted summary preserves the same information as in the original video. To this end, we propose to augment standard sequence learning models with an additional ``retrospective encoder'' that embeds the predicted summary into an abstract semantic space. The embedding is then compared to the embedding of the original video in the same space. The intuition is that both embeddings ought to be close to each other for a video and its corresponding summary. Thus our approach adds to the discriminative loss a metric learning loss that minimizes the distance between such pairs while maximizing the distances between unmatched ones. One important advantage is that the metric learning loss readily allows learning from videos without human generated summaries. Extensive experimental results show that our model outperforms existing ones by a large margin in both supervised and semi-supervised settings.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ke_Zhang_Retrospective_Encoders_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ke Zhang, Kristen Grauman, Fei Sha
Dist-GAN: An Improved GAN using Distance Constraints	"We introduce effective training algorithms for Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to alleviate mode collapse and gradient vanishing. In our system, we constrain the generator by an Autoencoder (AE). We propose a formulation to consider the reconstructed samples from AE as ""real'' samples for the discriminator. This couples the convergence of the AE with that of the discriminator, effectively slowing down the convergence of discriminator and reducing gradient vanishing. Importantly, we propose two novel distance constraints to improve the generator. First, we propose a latent-data distance constraint to enforce compatibility between the latent sample distances and the corresponding data sample distances. We use this constraint to explicitly prevent the generator from mode collapse. Second, we propose a discriminator-score distance constraint to align the distribution of the generated samples with that of the real samples through the discriminator score. We use this constraint to guide the generator to synthesize samples that resemble the real ones. Our proposed GAN using these distance constraints, namely Dist-GAN, can achieve better results than state-of-the-art methods across benchmark datasets: synthetic, MNIST, MNIST-1K, CelebA, CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets. Our code is published here (https://github.com/tntrung/gan) for research."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ngoc-Trung_Tran_Generative_Adversarial_Autoencoder_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ngoc-Trung Tran, Tuan-Anh Bui, Ngai-Man Cheung
Recovering 3D Planes from a Single Image via Convolutional Neural Networks	In this paper, we study the problem of recovering 3D planar surfaces from a single image of man-made environment. We show that it is possible to directly train a deep neural network to achieve this goal. A novel plane structure-induced loss is proposed to train the network to simultaneously predict a plane segmentation map and the parameters of the 3D planes. Further, to avoid the tedious manual labeling process, we show how to leverage existing large-scale RGB-D dataset to train our network without explicit 3D plane annotations, and how to take advantage of the semantic labels come with the dataset for accurate planar and non-planar classification. Experiment results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The recovered planes could potentially benefit many important visual tasks such as vision-based navigation and human-robot interaction.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Fengting_Yang_Recovering_3D_Planes_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Fengting Yang, Zihan Zhou
Neural Network Encapsulation	A capsule is a collection of neurons which represents different variants of a pattern in the network. The routing scheme ensures only certain capsules who resemble lower counterparts in the higher layer should be activated. However, the computational complexity becomes an bottleneck for scaling up to larger networks, as lower capsules need to correspond to each and every higher capsule. To resolve this limitation, we approximate the routing process with two branches: a master branch which collects primary information from its direct contact in the lower layer and an aide branch that replenishes master based on pattern variants encoded in other lower capsules. Compared with previous iterative and unsupervised routing scheme, these two branches are communicated in a fast, supervised and one-time pass fashion. The complexity and runtime of the model are therefore decreased by a large margin. Motivated by the routing to make higher capsule have agreement with lower capsule, we extend the mechanism as a compensation for the rapid loss of information in nearby layers. We devise a feedback agreement unit to send back higher capsules as feedback. It could be regarded as an additional regularization to the network. The feedback agreement is achieved by comparing the optimal transport divergence between two distributions. Such an add-on witnesses a unanimous gain in both capsule and vanilla networks. Our proposed EncapNet performs favorably better against previous state-of-the-arts on CIFAR10/100, SVHN and a subset of ImageNet which consists of 200 hardest object classes.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Hongyang_Li_Neural_Network_Encapsulation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Hongyang Li, Xiaoyang Guo, Bo DaiWanli Ouyang, Xiaogang Wang
CTAP: Complementary Temporal Action Proposal Generation	"Temporal action proposal generation is an important task, akin to object proposals, temporal action proposals are intended to capture ""clips"" or temporal intervals in videos that are likely to contain an action. Previous methods can be divided to two groups: sliding window ranking and actionness score grouping. Sliding windows uniformly cover all segments in videos, but the temporal boundaries are imprecise; grouping based method may have more precise boundaries but it may omit some proposals when the quality of actionness score is low. Based on the complementary characteristics of these two methods, we propose a novel Complementary Temporal Action Proposal (CTAP) generator. Specifically, we apply a Proposal-level Actionness Trustworthiness Estimator (PATE) on the sliding windows proposals to generate the probabilities indicating whether the actions can be correctly detected by actionness scores, the windows with high scores are collected. The collected sliding windows and actionness proposals are then processed by a temporal convolutional neural network for proposal ranking and boundary adjustment. CTAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on average recall (AR) by a large margin on THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet 1.3 datasets. We further apply CTAP as a proposal generation method in an existing action detector, and show consistent significant improvements."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jiyang_Gao_CTAP_Complementary_Temporal_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jiyang Gao, Kan Chen, Ram Nevatia
Deep Pictorial Gaze Estimation	Estimating human gaze from natural eye images only is a challenging task. Gaze direction can be defined by the pupil- and the eyeball center where the latter is unobservable in 2D images. Hence, achieving highly accurate gaze estimates is an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep neural network architecture specifically designed for the task of gaze estimation from single eye input. Instead of directly regressing two angles for the pitch and yaw of the eyeball, we regress to an intermediate pictorial representation which in turn simplifies the task of 3D gaze direction estimation. Our quantitative and qualitative results show that our approach achieves higher accuracies than the state-of-the-art and is robust to variation in gaze, head pose and image quality.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Seonwook_Park_Deep_Pictorial_Gaze_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Seonwook Park, Adrian Spurr, Otmar Hilliges
DeepKSPD: Learning Kernel-matrix-based SPD Representation for Fine-grained Image Recognition	As a second-order pooled representation, covariance matrix has attracted much attention in visual recognition, and some pioneering works have recently integrated it into deep learning framework to jointly learn this matrix for fine-grained image recognition. A recent study shows that kernel matrix works considerably better than covariance matrix for this kind of representation, by modeling the higher-order, nonlinear relationship among pooled visual descriptors. Nevertheless, in that study neither the descriptors nor the kernel matrix is deeply learned. Worse, they are considered separately, hindering the pursuit of an optimal representation. To improve this situation, this work designs a deep network that jointly learns local descriptors and kernel-matrix-based pooled representation in an end-to-end manner. The derivatives for the mapping from a local descriptor set to this representation are derived to carry out backpropagation. More importantly, we introduce the {Daleckiv{i}-Krev{i}n formula} from Operator theory to give a concise and unified result on differentiating general functions defined on symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrix, which shows its better numerical stability in conducting backpropagation compared with the existing method when handling the Riemannian geometry of SPD matrix. Experiments on multiple fine-grained image benchmark datasets not only show the superiority of kernel-matrix-based SPD representation with deep local descriptors, but also verify the advantage of the proposed deep network in pursuing better SPD representations. Also, ablation study is provided to explain why and from where these improvements are attained.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Melih_Engin_DeepKSPD_Learning_Kernel-matrix-based_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Melih Engin, Lei Wang, Luping Zhou, Xinwang Liu
Deep Discriminative Model for Video Classification	This paper presents a new deep learning approach for video-based scene classification. We design a Heterogeneous Deep Discriminative Model (HDDM) whose parameters are initialized by performing an unsupervised pre-training in a layer-wise fashion using Gaussian Restricted Boltzmann Machines (GRBM). In order to avoid the redundancy of adjacent frames, we extract spatiotemporal variation patterns within frames and represent them sparsely using Sparse Cubic Symmetrical Pattern (SCSP). Then, a pre-initialized HDDM is separately trained using the videos of each class to learn class-specific models. According to the minimum reconstruction error from the learnt class-specific models, a weighted voting strategy is employed for the classification. The performance of the proposed method is extensively evaluated on two action recognition datasets; UCF101 and Hollywood II, and three dynamic texture and dynamic scene datasets; DynTex, YUPENN, and Maryland. The experimental results and comparisons against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves superior performance on all datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Mohammad_Tavakolian_Deep_Discriminative_Model_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Mohammad Tavakolian, Abdenour Hadid
RCAA: Relational Context-Aware Agents for Person Search	We aim to search for a target person from a gallery of whole scene images for which the annotations of pedestrian bounding boxes are unavailable. Previous approaches to this problem have relied on a pedestrian proposal net, which may generate redundant proposals and increase the computational burden. In this paper, we address this problem by training relational context-aware agents which learn the actions to localize the target person from the gallery of whole scene images. We incorporate the relational spatial and temporal contexts into the framework. Specifically, we propose to use the target person as the query in the query-dependent relational network. The agent determines the best action to take at each time step by simultaneously considering the local visual information, the relational and temporal contexts, together with the target person. To validate the performance of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale Person Search benchmark dataset and achieve significant improvements over the compared approaches. It is also worth noting that the proposed model even performs better than traditional methods with perfect pedestrian detectors.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiaojun_Chang_RCAA_Relational_Context-Aware_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiaojun Chang, Po-Yao Huang, Yi-Dong Shen, Xiaodan Liang, Yi Yang, Alexander G.

Dense Pose Transfer	In this work we integrate ideas from surface-based modeling with neural synthesis: we propose a combination of surface-based pose estimation and deep generative models that allows us to perform accurate pose transfer, i.e. synthesize a new image of a person based on a single image of that person and the image of a pose donor. We use a dense pose estimation system that maps pixels from both images to a common surface-based coordinate system, allowing the two images to be brought in correspondence with each other. We inpaint and refine the source image intensities in the surface coordinate system, prior to warping them onto the target pose. These predictions are fused with those of a convolutional predictive module through a neural synthesis module allowing for training the whole pipeline jointly end-to-end, optimizing a combination of adversarial and perceptual losses. We show that dense pose estimation is a substantially more powerful conditioning input than landmark-, or mask-based alternatives, and report systematic improvements over state of the art generators on DeepFashion and MVC datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Natalia_Neverova_Two_Stream__ECCV_2018_paper.php	Natalia Neverova, Riza Alp Guler, Iasonas Kokkinos
Constrained Optimization Based Low-Rank Approximation of Deep Neural Networks	We present COBLA---Constrained Optimization Based Low-rank Approximation---a systematic method of finding an optimal low-rank approximation of a trained convolutional neural network, subject to constraints in the number of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations and the memory footprint. COBLA optimally allocates the constrained computation resource into each layer of the approximated network. The singular value decomposition of the network weight is computed, then a binary masking variable is introduced to denote whether a particular singular value and the corresponding singular vectors are used in low-rank approximation. With this formulation, the number of the MAC operations and the memory footprint are represented as linear constraints in terms of the binary masking variables. The resulted 0-1 integer programming problem is approximately solved by sequential quadratic programming. COBLA does not introduce any hyperparameter. We empirically demonstrate that COBLA outperforms prior art using the SqueezeNet and VGG-16 architecture on the ImageNet dataset.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Chong_Li_Constrained_Optimization_Based_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Chong Li, C.

Normalized Blind Deconvolution	We introduce a family of novel approaches to single-image blind deconvolution, ie , the problem of recovering a sharp image and a blur kernel from a single blurry input. This problem is highly ill-posed, because infinite (image, blur) pairs produce the same blurry image. Most research effort has been devoted to the design of priors for natural images and blur kernels, which can drastically prune the set of possible solutions. Unfortunately, these priors are usually not sufficient to favor the sharp solution. In this paper we address this issue by looking at a much less studied aspect: the relative scale ambiguity between the sharp image and the blur. Most prior work eliminates this ambiguity by fixing the $L^1$ norm of the blur kernel. In principle, however, this choice is arbitrary. We show that a careful design of the blur normalization yields a blind deconvolution formulation with remarkable accuracy and robustness to noise. Specifically, we show that using the Frobenius norm to fix the scale ambiguity enables convex image priors, such as the total variation, to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Meiguang_Jin_Normalized_Blind_Deconvolution_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Meiguang Jin, Stefan Roth, Paolo Favaro
Instance-level Human Parsing via Part Grouping Network	"Instance-level human parsing towards real-world human analysis scenarios is still under-explored due to the absence of sufficient data resources and technical difficulty in parsing multiple instances in a single pass. Several related works all follow the ``parsing-by-detection"" pipeline that heavily relies on separately trained detection models to localize instances and then performs human parsing for each instance sequentially. Nonetheless, two discrepant optimization targets of detection and parsing lead to suboptimal representation learning and error accumulation for final results. In this work, we make the first attempt to explore a detection-free Part Grouping Network (PGN) for efficiently parsing multiple people in an image in a single pass. Our PGN reformulates instance-level human parsing as two twinned sub-tasks that can be jointly learned and mutually refined via a unified network: 1) semantic part segmentation for assigning each pixel as a human part (e.g., face, arms); 2) instance-aware edge detection to group semantic parts into distinct person instances. Thus the shared intermediate representation would be endowed with capabilities in both characterizing fine-grained parts and inferring instance belongings of each part. Finally, a simple instance partition process is employed to get final results during inference. We conducted experiments on PASCAL-Person-Part dataset and our PGN outperforms all state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show its superiority on a newly collected multi-person parsing dataset (CIHP) including 38,280 diverse images, which is the largest dataset so far and can facilitate more advanced human analysis."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ke_Gong_Instance-level_Human_Parsing_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ke Gong, Xiaodan Liang, Yicheng Li, Yimin Chen, Ming Yang, Liang Lin
PS-FCN: A Flexible Learning Framework for Photometric Stereo	This paper addresses the problem of photometric stereo for non-Lambertian surfaces. Existing approaches often adopt simplified reflectance models to make the problem more tractable, but this greatly hinders their applications on real-world objects. In this paper, we propose a deep fully convolutional network, called PS-FCN, that takes an arbitrary number of images of a static object captured under different light directions with a fixed camera as input, and predicts a normal map of the object in a fast feed-forward pass. Unlike the recently proposed learning based method, PS-FCN does not require a pre-defined set of light directions during training and testing, and can handle multiple images and light directions in an order-agnostic manner. Although we train PS-FCN on synthetic data, it can generalize well on real datasets. We further show that PS-FCN can be easily extended to handle the problem of uncalibrated photometric stereo. Extensive experiments on public real datasets show that PS-FCN outperforms existing approaches in calibrated photometric stereo, and promising results are achieved in uncalibrated scenario, clearly demonstrating its effectiveness.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Guanying_Chen_PS-FCN_A_Flexible_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Guanying Chen, Kai Han, Kwan-Yee K.

Incremental Non-Rigid Structure-from-Motion with Unknown Focal Length	The perspective camera and the isometric surface prior have recently gathered increased attention for Non-Rigid Structure-from-Motion (NRSfM). De- spite the recent progress, several challenges remain, particularly the computa- tional complexity and the unknown camera focal length. In this paper we present a method for incremental Non-Rigid Structure-from-Motion (NRSfM) with the perspective camera model and the isometric surface prior with unknown focal length. In the template-based case, we provide a method to estimate four param- eters of the camera intrinsics. For the template-less scenario of NRSfM, we pro- pose a method to upgrade reconstructions obtained for one focal length to another based on local rigidity and the so-called Maximum Depth Heuristics (MDH). On its basis we propose a method to simultaneously recover the focal length and the non-rigid shapes. We further solve the problem of incorporating a large number of points and adding more views in MDH-based NRSfM and efficiently solve them with Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP). This does not require any shape initialization and produces results orders of times faster than many methods. We provide evaluations on standard sequences with ground-truth and qualitative re- constructions on challenging YouTube videos. These evaluations show that our method performs better in both speed and accuracy than the state of the art.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Thomas_Probst_Incremental_Non-Rigid_Structure-from-Motion_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Thomas Probst, Danda Pani Paudel, Ajad Chhatkuli, Luc Van Gool
Diverse Conditional Image Generation by Stochastic Regression with Latent Drop-Out Codes	Recent advances in Deep Learning and probabilistic modeling have let to strong improvements in generative models for images. On the one hand, GANs have contributed a highly effective adversarial learning procedure, but still suffer from stability issues. On the other hand, CVAE models provide a sound way of conditional modeling but suffer from mode-mixing issues. Therefore, recent work has turned back to simple and stable regression models that are effective at generation but give up on the sampling mechanism and the latent code representation. We propose a novel and efficient stochastic regression approach with latent drop-out codes that combines the merits of both lines of research. In addition, a new training objective enforces coverage of the training distribution leading to improvements over the state of the art in terms of accuracy as well as diversity.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yang_He_Diverse_Conditional_Image_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yang He, Bernt Schiele, Mario Fritz
Image Reassembly Combining Deep Learning and Shortest Path Problem	This paper addresses the problem of reassembling images from disjointed fragments. More specifically, given an unordered set of fragments, we aim at reassembling one or several possibly incomplete images. The main contributions of this work are: 1) several deep neural architectures to predict the relative position of image fragments that outperform the previous state of the art; 2) casting the reassembly problem into the shortest path in a graph problem for which we provide several construction algorithms depending on available information; 3) a new dataset of images taken from the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) dedicated to image reassembly for which we provide a clear setup and a strong baseline.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Marie-Morgane_Paumard_Image_Reassembly_Combining_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Marie-Morgane Paumard, David Picard, Hedi Tabia
Sampling Algebraic Varieties for Robust Camera Autocalibration	This paper addresses the problem of robustly autocalibrating a moving camera with constant intrinsics. The proposed calibration method uses the Branch-and-Bound (BnB) search paradigm to maximize the consensus of the polynomials. These polynomials are parameterized by the entries of, either the Dual Image of Absolute Conic (DIAC) or the Plane-at-Infinity (PaI). During the BnB search, we exploit the theory of sampling algebraic varieties, to test the positivity of any polynomial within a parameter's interval, i.e. outliers with certainty. The search process explores the space of exact parameters (i.e the entries of DIAC or PaI), benefits from the solution of a local method, and converges to the solution satisfied by the largest number of polynomials. Given many polynomials on the sought parameters (with possibly overwhelmingly many from outlier measurements), their consensus for calibration is searched for two cases: simplified Kruppa's equations and Modulus constraints, expressed in DIAC and PaI, resp. Our approach yields outstanding results in terms of robustness and optimality.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Danda_Pani_Paudel_Sampling_Algebraic_Varieties_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Danda Pani Paudel, Luc Van Gool
Switchable Temporal Propagation Network	Videos contain highly redundant information between frames. Such redundancy has been studied extensively in video compression and encoding but is less explored for more advanced video processing. In this paper, we propose a learnable unified framework for propagating a variety of visual properties of video images, including but not limited to color, high dynamic range (HDR), and segmentation mask, where the properties are available for only a few key-frames. Our approach is based on a temporal propagation network (TPN), which models the transition-related affinity between a pair of frames in a purely data-driven manner. We theoretically prove two essential properties of TPN: (a) by regularizing the global transformation matrix as orthogonal, the ``style energy'' of the property can be well preserved during propagation; and (b) such regularization can be achieved by the proposed switchable TPN with bi-directional training on pairs of frames. We apply the switchable TPN to three tasks: colorizing a gray-scale video based on a few colored key-frames, generating an HDR video from a low dynamic range (LDR) video and a few HDR frames, and propagating a segmentation mask from the first frame in videos. Experimental results show that our approach is significantly more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Sifei_Liu_Switchable_Temporal_Propagation_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Sifei Liu, Guangyu Zhong, Shalini De Mello, Jinwei Gu, Varun Jampani, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Jan Kautz
Penalizing Top Performers: Conservative Loss for Semantic Segmentation Adaptation	Due to the expensive and time-consuming annotations (e.g., segmentation) for real-world images, recent works in computer vision resort to synthetic data. However, the performance on the real image often drops significantly because of the domain shift between the synthetic data and the real images. In this setting, domain adaptation brings an appealing option. The effective approaches of domain adaptation shape the representations that (1) are discriminative for the main task and (2) have good generalization capability for domain shift. To this end, we propose a novel loss function, i.e., Conservative Loss, which penalizes the extreme good and bad cases while encouraging the moderate examples. More specifically, it enables the network to learn features that are discriminative by gradient descent and are invariant to the change of domains via gradient ascend method. Extensive experiments on synthetic to real segmentation adaptation show our proposed method achieves state of the art results. Ablation studies give more insights into properties of the Conservative Loss. Additional exploratory experiments and discussion demonstrate that our Conservative Loss has good scalability rather than restricting an exact form.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xinge_Zhu_Penalizing_Top_Performers_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xinge Zhu, Hui Zhou, Ceyuan Yang, Jianping Shi, Dahua Lin
PSDF Fusion: Probabilistic Signed Distance Function for On-the-fly 3D Data Fusion and Scene Reconstruction	We propose a novel 3D spatial representation for data fusion and scene reconstruction. Probabilistic Signed Distance Function (Probabilistic SDF, PSDF) is proposed to depict uncertainties in the 3D space. It is modeled by a joint distribution describing SDF value and its inlier probability, reflecting input data quality and surface geometry. A hybrid data structure involving voxel, surfel, and mesh is designed to fully exploit the advantages of various prevalent 3D representations. Connected by PSDF, these components reasonably cooperate in a consistent frame- work. Given sequential depth measurements, PSDF can be incrementally refined with less ad hoc parametric Bayesian updating. Supported by PSDF and the efficient 3D data representation, high-quality surfaces can be extracted on-the-fly, and in return contribute to reliable data fu- sion using the geometry information. Experiments demonstrate that our system reconstructs scenes with higher model quality and lower redundancy, and runs faster than existing online mesh generation systems.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Wei_Dong_Probabilistic_Signed_Distance_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Wei Dong, Qiuyuan Wang, Xin Wang, Hongbin Zha
AMC: AutoML for Model Compression and Acceleration on Mobile Devices	Model compression is an effective technique to efficiently deploy neural network models on mobile devices which have limited computation resources and tight power budgets. Conventional model compression techniques rely on hand-crafted features and require domain experts to explore the large design space trading off among model size, speed, and accuracy, which is usually sub-optimal and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose AutoML for Model Compression (AMC) which leverages reinforcement learning to efficiently sample the design space and can improve the model compression quality. We achieved state-of- the-art model compression results in a fully automated way without any human efforts. Under 4× FLOPs reduction, we achieved 2.7% better accuracy than the hand-crafted model compression method for VGG-16 on ImageNet. We applied this automated, push-the-button compression pipeline to MobileNet-V1 and achieved a speedup of 1.53x on the GPU (Titan Xp) and 1.95x on an Android phone (Google Pixel 1), with negligible loss of accuracy.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yihui_He_AMC_Automated_Model_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yihui He, Ji Lin, Zhijian Liu, Hanrui Wang, Li-Jia Li, Song Han
Learning Region Features for Object Detection	While most steps in the modern object detection methods are learnable, the region feature extraction step remains largely hand-crafted, featured by RoI pooling methods. This work proposes a general viewpoint that unifies existing region feature extraction methods and a novel method that is end-to-end learnable. The proposed method removes most heuristic choices and outperforms its RoI pooling counterparts. It moves further towards emph{fully learnable object detection}.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Jiayuan_Gu_Learning_Region_Features_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Jiayuan Gu, Han Hu, Liwei Wang, Yichen Wei, Jifeng Dai
Parallel Feature Pyramid Network for Object Detection	Recently developed object detectors employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) by gradually increasing the number of feature layers with a pyramidal shape instead of using a featurized image pyramid. However, the different abstraction levels of the CNN feature layers often limit the detection performance, especially on small objects. To overcome this limitation, we propose a CNN-based object detection architecture, referred to as a parallel feature pyramid (FP) network (PFPNet), where the FP is constructed by widening the network width instead of increasing the network depth. First, we adopt spatial pyramid pooling and some additional feature transformations to generate a pool of feature maps with different sizes. In PFPNet, the additional feature transformation is performed in parallel, which yields the feature maps with similar levels of semantic abstraction across the scales. We then resize the elements of the feature pool to a uniform size and aggregate their contextual information to generate each level of the final FP. The experimental results confirmed that PFPNet increases the performance of the latest version of the single-shot multi-box detector (SSD) by mAP of 6.4% AP and especially, 7.8% AP_small on the MS-COCO dataset.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Seung-Wook_Kim_Parallel_Feature_Pyramid_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Seung-Wook Kim, Hyong-Keun Kook, Jee-Young Sun, Mun-Cheon Kang, Sung-Jea Ko
BusterNet: Detecting Copy-Move Image Forgery with Source/Target Localization	We introduce a novel deep neural architecture for image copy-move forgery detection (CMFD), code-named BusterNet. Unlike previous eorts, BusterNet is a pure, end-to-end trainable, deep neural network solution. It features a two-branch architecture followed by a fu- sion module. The two branches localize potential manipulation regions (by looking for visual artifacts) and copy-move regions (by assessing vi- sual similarities), respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst CMFD algorithm with discernibility to localize source/target re- gions.We also propose simple schemes for synthesizing large-scale CMFD samples using out-of-domain datasets, and stage-wise strategies for eec- tive BusterNet training. Our extensive studies demonstrate that Buster- Net outperforms state-of-the-art copy-move detection algorithms by a large margin on the two publicly available datasets, CASIA and CoMo- FoD, and that it is robust against various known attacks.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Rex_Yue_Wu_BusterNet_Detecting_Copy-Move_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yue Wu, Wael Abd-Almageed, Prem Natarajan
Deep Continuous Fusion for Multi-Sensor 3D Object Detection	In this paper, we propose a novel 3D object detector that can exploit both LIDAR as well as cameras to perform very accurate localization. Towards this goal, we design an end-to-end learnable architecture that exploits continuous convolutions to fuse image and LIDAR feature maps at different levels of resolution. Our proposed continuous fusion layer encode both discrete-state image features as well as continuous geometric information. This enables us to design a novel, reliable and efficient end-to-end learnable 3D object detector based on multiple sensors. Our experimental evaluation on both KITTI as well as a large scale 3D object detection benchmark shows significant improvements over the state of the art.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ming_Liang_Deep_Continuous_Fusion_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ming Liang, Bin Yang, Shenlong Wang, Raquel Urtasun
A Dataset of Flash and Ambient Illumination Pairs from the Crowd	Illumination is a critical element of photography and is essential for many computer vision tasks. Flash light is unique in the sense that it is a widely available tool for easily manipulating the scene illumination. We present a dataset of thousands of ambient and flash illumination pairs to enable studying flash photography and other applications that can benefit from having separate illuminations. Different than the typical use of crowdsourcing in generating computer vision datasets, we make use of the crowd to directly take the photographs that make up our dataset. As a result, our dataset covers a wide variety of scenes captured by many casual photographers. We detail the advantages and challenges of our approach to crowdsourcing as well as the computational effort to generate completely separate flash illuminations from the ambient light in an uncontrolled setup. We present a brief examination of illumination decomposition, a challenging and underconstrained problem in flash photography, to demonstrate the use of our dataset in a data-driven approach.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yagiz_Aksoy_A_Dataset_of_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yagiz Aksoy, Changil Kim, Petr Kellnhofer, Sylvain Paris, Mohamed Elgharib, Marc Pollefeys, Wojciech Matusik
Grounding Visual Explanations	Existing visual explanation generating agents learn to fluently justify a class prediction. However, they may mention visual attributes which reflect a strong class prior, although the evidence may not actually be in the image. This is particularly concerning as ultimately such agents fail in building trust with human users. To overcome this limitation, we propose a phrase-critic model to refine generated candidate explanations augmented with flipped phrases which we use as negative examples while training. At inference time, our phrase-critic model takes an image and a candidate explanation as input and outputs a score indicating how well the candidate explanation is grounded in the image. Our explainable AI agent is capable of providing counter arguments for an alternative prediction, i.e. counterfactuals, along with explanations that justify the correct classification decisions. Our model improves the textual explanation quality of fine-grained classification decisions on the CUB dataset by mentioning phrases that are grounded in the image. Moreover, on the FOIL tasks, our agent detects when there is a mistake in the sentence, grounds the incorrect phrase and corrects it significantly better than other models.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Lisa_Anne_Hendricks_Grounding_Visual_Explanations_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Lisa Anne Hendricks, Ronghang Hu, Trevor Darrell, Zeynep Akata
Real-Time MDNet	We present a fast and accurate visual tracking algorithm based on the multi-domain convolutional neural network (MDNet). The proposed approach accelerates feature extraction procedure and learns more discriminative models for instance classification; it enhances representation quality of target and background by maintaining a high resolution feature map with a large receptive field per activation. We also introduce a novel loss term to differentiate foreground instances across multiple domains and learn a more discriminative embedding of target objects with similar semantics. The proposed techniques are integrated into the pipeline of a well known CNN-based visual tracking algorithm, MDNet. We accomplish approximately 25 times speed-up with almost identical accuracy compared to MDNet. Our algorithm is evaluated in multiple popular tracking benchmark datasets including OTB2015, UAV123, and TempleColor, and outperforms the state-of-the-art real-time tracking methods consistently even without dataset-specific parameter tuning.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ilchae_Jung_Real-Time_MDNet_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ilchae Jung, Jeany Son, Mooyeol Baek, Bohyung Han
Deep Expander Networks: Efficient Deep Networks from Graph Theory	Efficient CNN designs like ResNets and DenseNet were proposed to improve accuracy vs efficiency trade-offs. They essentially increased the connectivity, allowing efficient information flow across layers. Inspired by these techniques, we propose to model connections between filters of a CNN using graphs which are simultaneously sparse and well connected. Sparsity results in efficiency while well connectedness can preserve the expressive power of the CNNs. We use a well-studied class of graphs from theoretical computer science that satisfies these properties known as Expander graphs. Expander graphs are used to model connections between filters in CNNs to design networks called X-Nets. We present two guarantees on the connectivity of X-Nets: Each node influences every node in a layer in logarithmic steps, and the number of paths between two sets of nodes is proportional to the product of their sizes. We also propose efficient training and inference algorithms, making it possible to train deeper and wider X-Nets effectively. Expander based models give a 4% improvement in accuracy on MobileNet over grouped convolutions, a popular technique, which has the same sparsity but worse connectivity. X-Nets give better performance trade-offs than the original ResNet and DenseNet-BC architectures. We achieve model sizes comparable to state-of-the-art pruning techniques using our simple architecture design, without any pruning. We hope that this work motivates other approaches to utilize results from graph theory to develop efficient network architectures.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ameya_Prabhu_Deep_Expander_Networks_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ameya Prabhu, Girish Varma, Anoop Namboodiri
Physical Primitive Decomposition	Objects are made of parts, each with distinct geometry, physics, functionality, and affordances. Developing such a distributed, physical, interpretable representation of objects will facilitate intelligent agents to better explore and interact with the world. In this paper, we study physical primitive decomposition---understanding an object through its components, each with physical and geometric attributes. As annotated data for object parts and physics are rare, we propose a novel formulation that learns physical primitives by explaining both an object's appearance and its behaviors in physical events. Our model performs well on block towers and tools in both synthetic and real scenarios; we also demonstrate that visual and physical observations often provide complementary signals. We further present ablation and behavioral studies to better understand our model and contrast it with human performance.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhijian_Liu_Physical_Primitive_Decomposition_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhijian Liu, William T.

AGIL: Learning Attention from Human for Visuomotor Tasks	When intelligent agents learn visuomotor behaviors from human demonstrations, they may benefit from knowing where the human is allocating visual attention, which can be inferred from their gaze. A wealth of information regarding intelligent decision making is conveyed by human gaze allocation; hence, exploiting such information has the potential to improve the agents' performance. With this motivation, we propose the AGIL (Attention Guided Imitation Learning) framework. We collect high-quality human action and gaze data while playing Atari games in a carefully controlled experimental setting. Using these data, we first train a deep neural network that can predict human gaze positions and visual attention with high accuracy (the gaze network) and then train another network to predict human actions (the policy network). Incorporating the learned attention model from the gaze network into the policy network significantly improves the action prediction accuracy and task performance.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ruohan_Zhang_AGIL_Learning_Attention_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ruohan Zhang, Zhuode Liu, Luxin Zhang, Jake A.

Fast Light Field Reconstruction With Deep Coarse-To-Fine Modeling of Spatial-Angular Clues	Densely-sampled light fields (LFs) are beneficial to many applications such as depth inference and post-capture refocusing. However, it is costly and challenging to capture them. In this paper, we propose a learning based algorithm to reconstruct a densely-sampled LF fast and accurately from a sparsely-sampled LF in one forward pass. Our method uses computationally efficient convolutions to deeply characterize the high dimensional spatial-angular clues in a coarse-tofine manner. Specifically, our end-to-end model first synthesizes a set of intermediate novel sub-aperture images (SAIs) by exploring the coarse characteristics of the sparsely-sampled LF input with spatial-angular alternating convolutions. Then, the synthesized intermediate novel SAIs are efficiently refined by further recovering the fine relations from all SAIs via guided residual learning and stride-2 4-D convolutions. Experimental results on extensive real-world and synthetic LF images show that our model can provide more than 3 dB advantage in reconstruction quality in average than the state-of-the-art methods while being computationally faster by a factor of 30. Besides, more accurate depth can be inferred from the reconstructed densely-sampled LFs by our method.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Henry_W._F._Yeung_Fast_Light_Field_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Henry Wing Fung Yeung, Junhui Hou, Jie Chen, Yuk Ying Chung, Xiaoming Chen
Zero-Annotation Object Detection with Web Knowledge Transfer	Object detection is one of the major problems in computer vision, and has been extensively studied. Most of the existing detection works rely on labor-intensive supervision, such as ground truth bounding boxes of objects or at least image-level annotations. On the contrary, we propose an object detection method that does not require any form of human annotation on target tasks, by exploiting freely available web images. In order to facilitate effective knowledge transfer from web images, we introduce a multi-instance multi-label domain adaption learning framework with two key innovations. First of all, we propose an instance-level adversarial domain adaptation network with attention on foreground objects to transfer the object appearances from web domain to target domain. Second, to preserve the class-specific semantic structure of transferred object features, we propose a simultaneous transfer mechanism to transfer the supervision across domains through pseudo strong label generation. With our end-to-end framework that simultaneously learns a weakly supervised detector and transfers knowledge across domains, we achieved significant improvements over baseline methods on the benchmark datasets.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Qingyi_Tao_Zero-Annotation_Object_Detection_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Qingyi Tao, Hao Yang, Jianfei Cai
Depth Estimation via Affinity Learned with Convolutional Spatial Propagation Network	Depth estimation from a single image is a fundamental problem in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective convolutional spatial propagation network (CSPN) to learn the affinity matrix for depth prediction. Specifically, we adopt an efficient linear propagation model, where the propagation is performed with a manner of recurrent convolutional operation, and the affinity among neighboring pixels is learned through a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). We apply the designed CSPN to two depth estimation tasks given a single image: (1) To refine the depth output from state-of-the-art (SOTA) existing methods; and (2) to convert sparse depth samples to a dense depth map by embedding the depth samples within the propagation procedure. The second task is inspired by the availability of LIDARs that provides sparse but accurate depth measurements. We experimented the proposed CSPN over two popular benchmarks for depth estimation, ie NYU v2 and KITTI, where we show that our proposed approach improves in not only quality (e.g., 30% more reduction in depth error), but also speed (e.g., 2 to 5$ imes$ faster) than prior SOTA methods.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xinjing_Cheng_Depth_Estimation_via_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xinjing Cheng, Peng Wang, Ruigang Yang
Context Refinement for Object Detection	Current two-stage object detectors, which consists of a region proposal stage and a refinement stage, may produce unreliable results due to ill-localized proposed regions. To address this problem, we propose a context refinement algorithm that explores rich contextual information to better refine each proposed region. In particular, we first identify neighboring regions that may contain useful contexts and then perform refinement based on the extracted and unified contextual information. In practice, our method effectively improves the quality of the final detection results as well as region proposals. Empirical studies show that context refinement yields substantial and consistent improvements over different baseline detectors. Moreover, the proposed algorithm brings around 3% performance gain on PASCAL VOC benchmark and around 6% gain on MS COCO benchmark respectively.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Zhe_Chen_Context_Refinement_for_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Zhe Chen, Shaoli Huang, Dacheng Tao
VQA-E: Explaining, Elaborating, and Enhancing Your Answers for Visual Questions	Most existing works in visual question answering (VQA) are dedicated to improving the accuracy of predicted answers, while disregarding the explanations. We argue that the explanation for an answer is of the same or even more importance compared with the answer itself, since it makes the question and answering process more understandable and traceable. To this end, we propose a new task of VQA-E (VQA with Explanation), where the computational models are required to generate an explanation with the predicted answer. We first construct a new dataset, and then frame the VQA-E problem in a multi-task learning architecture. Our VQA-E dataset is automatically derived from the VQA v2 dataset by intelligently exploiting the available captions. We have conducted a user study to validate the quality of explanations synthesized by our method. We quantitatively show that the additional supervision from explanations can not only produce insightful textual sentences to justify the answers, but also improve the performance of answer prediction. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin on the VQA v2 dataset.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Qing_Li_VQA-E_Explaining_Elaborating_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Qing Li, Qingyi Tao, Shafiq Joty, Jianfei Cai, Jiebo Luo
MRF Optimization with Separable Convex Prior on Partially Ordered Labels	Solving a multi-labeling problem with a convex penalty can be achieved in polynomial time if the label set is totally ordered. In this paper we propose a generalization to partially ordered sets. To this end, we assume that the label set is the Cartesian product of totally ordered sets and the convex prior is separable. For this setting we introduce a general combinatorial optimization framework that provides an approximate solution. More specifically, we first construct a graph whose minimal cut provides a lower bound to our energy. The result of this relaxation is then used to get a feasible solution via classical move-making cuts. To speed up the optimization, we propose an efficient coarse-to-fine approach over the label space. We demonstrate the proposed framework through extensive experiments for optical flow estimation.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Csaba_Domokos_MRF_Optimization_with_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Csaba Domokos, Frank R.

Multi-Class Model Fitting by Energy Minimization and Mode-Seeking	We propose a general formulation, called Multi-X, for multi-class multi-instance model fitting - the problem of interpreting the input data as a mixture of noisy observations originating from multiple instances of multiple classes. We extend the commonly used alpha-expansion-based technique with a new move in the label space. The move replaces a set of labels with the corresponding density mode in the model parameter domain, thus achieving fast and robust optimization. Key optimization parameters like the bandwidth of the mode seeking are set automatically within the algorithm. Considering that a group of outliers may form spatially coherent structures in the data, we propose a cross-validation-based technique removing statistically insignificant instances. Multi-X outperforms significantly the state-of-the-art on publicly available datasets for diverse problems: multiple plane and rigid motion detection; motion segmentation; simultaneous plane and cylinder fitting; circle and line fitting.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Daniel_Barath_Multi-Class_Model_Fitting_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Daniel Barath, Jiri Matas
Gray-box Adversarial Training	"Adversarial samples are perturbed inputs crafted to mislead the machine learning systems. A training mechanism, called adversarial training, which presents adversarial samples along with clean samples has been introduced to learn robust models. In order to scale adversarial training for large datasets, these perturbations can only be crafted using fast and simple methods (e.g., using gradient ascent). However, it is shown that adversarial training converges to a degenerate minimum, where the model appears to be robust by generating weaker adversaries. As a result, the models are vulnerable to simple black-box attacks. In this paper we, (i) demonstrate the drawbacks of existing evaluation policy, (ii) Introduce novel variants of white-box and black-box attacks, dubbed ""gray-box adversarial attacks"" based on which we propose novel evaluation method to assess the robustness of the learned models, and (iii) propose a novel variant of adversarial training, named ""Graybox Adversarial Training"" that uses intermediate versions of the models to seed the adversaries. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the models trained using our method exhibit better robustness compared to both undefended and adversarially trained models."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Vivek_B_S_Gray_box_adversarial_ECCV_2018_paper.php	B.

Deep Cross-Modal Projection Learning for Image-Text Matching	The key point of image-text matching is how to accurately measure the similarity between visual and textual inputs. Despite the great progress of associating the deep cross-modal embeddings with the bi-directional ranking loss, developing the strategies for mining useful triplets and selecting appropriate margins remains a challenge in real applications. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal projection matching (CMPM) loss and a cross-modal projection classification (CMPC) loss for learning discriminative image-text embeddings. The CMPM loss minimizes the KL divergence between the projection compatibility distributions and the normalized matching distributions defined with all the positive and negative samples in a mini-batch. The CMPC loss attempts to categorize the vector projection of representations from one modality onto another with the improved norm-softmax loss, for further enhancing the feature compactness of each class. Extensive analysis and experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Ying_Zhang_Deep_Cross-Modal_Projection_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Ying Zhang, Huchuan Lu
Open-World Stereo Video Matching with Deep RNN	In this paper, we propose a novel deep Recurrent Neural network (RNN) that takes a continuous (possibly previously unseen) stereo video as input, and directly predict a depth-map without of any pre-training process. The quality and accuracy of the obtained depth-map improves over time as new stereo frames being fed in. Thanks to the recurrent nature (based on two convolutional LSTM blocks) the network is able to memorize and learn from its past experience and gradually adapts its parameters (interconnection weights) to achieve better stereo matching result on the current stereo input. In this sense, our new method is an unsupervised network which does not rely on any labeled ground-truth depthmap, and it is able to work in a previously unseen or unfamiliar environments, suggesting a remarkable generaliability: it is applicable in an {em open-world} setting, by adapting its network parameters to generic stereo video inputs to be robust to changes in scene content, statistics, and lighting and season etc. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the method is able to seamlessly adapt between different scenarios. Also importantly, in terms of absolute stereo matching performance, it even outperforms the state of the art stereo algorithms on several standard benchmark datasets such as KITTI and Middlebury stereo.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Yiran_Zhong_Open-World_Stereo_Video_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Yiran Zhong, Hongdong Li, Yuchao Dai
Consensus-Driven Propagation in Massive Unlabeled Data for Face Recognition	"Face recognition has witnessed great progresses in recent years, mainly attributed to the high-capacity model designed and the abundant labeled data collected. However, it becomes more and more prohibitive to scale up the current million-level identity annotations. In this work, we show that unlabeled face data can be as effective as the labeled ones. Here, we consider a setting closely mimicking the real-world scenario, where the unlabeled data are collected from unconstrained environment and their identities are exclusive from the labeled ones. Our main insight is that although the class information is not available, we can still faithfully approximate these semantic relationship by constructing a relational graph in a bottom-up manner. We propose Consensus-Driven Propagation (CDP) to tackle this challenging problem with two well-designed modules, the ""committee"" and the ""mediator"", which select positive face pairs robustly by carefully aggregating multi-view information. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of both modules to discard outliers and mine hard positives. With CDP, we achieve a compelling 78.18% on MegaFace identification challenge by using only 9% of the labels, comparing to 61.78% when no unlabeled data are used and 78.52% when all the labels are employed."	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xiaohang_Zhan_Consensus-Driven_Propagation_in_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xiaohang Zhan , Ziwei Liu, Junjie Yan , Dahua Lin , Chen Change Loy
Pose Partition Networks for Multi-Person Pose Estimation	This paper proposes a novel Pose Partition Network (PPN) to address the challenging multi-person pose estimation problem. The proposed PPN is favorably featured by low complexity and high accuracy of joint detection and partition. In particular, PPN performs dense regressions from global joint candidates within a specific embedding space, which is parameterized by centroids of persons, to efficiently generate robust person detection and joint partitions. Then, PPN infers joint configurations of person poses through conducting graph partition for each person detection locally, utilizing reliable global affinity cues. In this way, PPN reduces computation complexity and improves multi-person pose estimation significantly. We implement PPN with the Hourglass architecture as the backbone network to simultaneously learn joint detector and dense regressor. Extensive experiments on benchmarks MPII Human Pose Multi-Person, extended PASCAL-Person-Part, and WAF, show the efficiency of PPN with new state-of-the-art performance.	https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2018/papers_ECCV/html/Xuecheng_Nie_Pose_Partition_Networks_ECCV_2018_paper.php	Xuecheng Nie, Jiashi Feng, Junliang Xing, Shuicheng Yan
